You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        n //= 10
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's first analyze the problem and the provided code.

**Problem Description Recap:**
The goal is to calculate the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The costs of the shovels are sequential integers from 1 to n.

**Understanding the Logic in Provided Code:**
1. The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of shovels.
2. It initializes `max_9s` to zero and uses a while loop to check how many trailing nines can be obtained by dividing `(n + 1)` by 10 repeatedly.
3. For every trailing 9 that can be achieved, `max_9s` is incremented.
4. The result is calculated using `(n + 1) * max_9s`, which ostensibly represents the number of pairs that can yield that maximum number of trailing nines.
5. Finally, it prints the calculated number of pairs.

**Potential Issues:**
1. The formula `(n + 1) * max_9s` does not correctly account for the specific pairs of shovels. The problem states that a shovel pair must be formed, but the burgeoning number of shovels may not produce all combinations for different values of `n`.
2. The logic fails to take into account edge cases, specifically for small values of `n`. For instance:
   - If `n = 2`, the only pair is (1, 2), and their sum is 3, which ends with 0 nines, but the expected pairs calculation might suggest otherwise based on the logic used (it might return 2, however, it should return 0).
   - For `n = 3`, we have (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3) and their sums do not meet any conditions stated for count based on forming nines.
   
Given such deductions, the code does not correctly handle the counting of shovel combinations leading to maximum trailing nines, especially for small inputs and does not provide a mechanism to represent all pairs correctly.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to accurately calculate the number of valid shovel pairs for various input values of `n`, especially when `n` is small. Thus, it shows an invalid counting method based on incomplete pair logic as described in the problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and calculates the number of trailing 9s in `n`. It then computes a final value by multiplying `(n + 1)` (after the removal of trailing 9s, resulting in `0`) with the count of how many trailing 9s were present initially. The final output produced by the function is always `0` since `n` becomes `0` after the while loop. Therefore, the function effectively counts the trailing 9s in `n`, but it will always print `0` as a result. The function does not handle invalid input cases or provide guidance when `n` does not meet the condition or contains no trailing 9s.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
