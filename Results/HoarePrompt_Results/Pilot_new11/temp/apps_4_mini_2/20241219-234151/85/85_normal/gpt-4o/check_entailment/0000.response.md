To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's first analyze the problem and the provided code.

**Problem Description Recap:**
The goal is to calculate the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The costs of the shovels are sequential integers from 1 to n.

**Understanding the Logic in Provided Code:**
1. The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of shovels.
2. It initializes `max_9s` to zero and uses a while loop to check how many trailing nines can be obtained by dividing `(n + 1)` by 10 repeatedly.
3. For every trailing 9 that can be achieved, `max_9s` is incremented.
4. The result is calculated using `(n + 1) * max_9s`, which ostensibly represents the number of pairs that can yield that maximum number of trailing nines.
5. Finally, it prints the calculated number of pairs.

**Potential Issues:**
1. The formula `(n + 1) * max_9s` does not correctly account for the specific pairs of shovels. The problem states that a shovel pair must be formed, but the burgeoning number of shovels may not produce all combinations for different values of `n`.
2. The logic fails to take into account edge cases, specifically for small values of `n`. For instance:
   - If `n = 2`, the only pair is (1, 2), and their sum is 3, which ends with 0 nines, but the expected pairs calculation might suggest otherwise based on the logic used (it might return 2, however, it should return 0).
   - For `n = 3`, we have (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3) and their sums do not meet any conditions stated for count based on forming nines.
   
Given such deductions, the code does not correctly handle the counting of shovel combinations leading to maximum trailing nines, especially for small inputs and does not provide a mechanism to represent all pairs correctly.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to accurately calculate the number of valid shovel pairs for various input values of `n`, especially when `n` is small. Thus, it shows an invalid counting method based on incomplete pair logic as described in the problem.
