The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the value of `pairs`. The value of `pairs` is currently 0, and there are no changes made to any other variables in the current code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and their values.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 0, `pairs` is 0 (printed value is 0)**
