The variable `pairs` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`. Given that `n` is 0, this simplifies to `1 * max_9s`, which means `pairs` is now equal to `max_9s`. Since `max_9s` is equal to the count of trailing 9s in the original value of `n`, and `n` is 0 (which has no trailing 9s), `max_9s` is 0. Therefore, the value of `pairs` becomes 0 as well.

The values of `n` and `max_9s` remain unchanged in terms of their description, but their specific state is now `max_9s` equals 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `max_9s` is 0, `pairs` is 0**
