You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n shovels in Polycarp's shop. The i-th shovel costs i burles, that is, the first shovel costs 1 burle, the second shovel costs 2 burles, the third shovel costs 3 burles, and so on. Polycarps wants to sell shovels in pairs.

Visitors are more likely to buy a pair of shovels if their total cost ends with several 9s. Because of this, Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with maximum possible number of nines. For example, if he chooses shovels with costs 12345 and 37454, their total cost is 49799, it ends with two nines.

You are to compute the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. Two pairs are considered different if there is a shovel presented in one pair, but not in the other.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with maximum possible number of nines. 

Note that it is possible that the largest number of 9s at the end is 0, then you should count all such ways.

It is guaranteed that for every n ≤ 10^9 the answer doesn't exceed 2·10^9.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
3

Input
14

Output
9

Input
50

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example the maximum possible number of nines at the end is one. Polycarp cah choose the following pairs of shovels for that purpose:  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5. 

In the second example the maximum number of nines at the end of total cost of two shovels is one. The following pairs of shovels suit Polycarp:  1 and 8;  2 and 7;  3 and 6;  4 and 5;  5 and 14;  6 and 13;  7 and 12;  8 and 11;  9 and 10. 

In the third example it is necessary to choose shovels 49 and 50, because the sum of their cost is 99, that means that the total number of nines is equal to two, which is maximum possible for n = 50.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the provided program against the problem description, I will analyze the requirements for counting pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

### Requirements from the Problem Description:
1. **Input**: A single integer `n` representing the number of shovels, where each shovel's cost is its index (from 1 to `n`).
2. **Output**: The number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost has the maximum possible number of trailing nines.

### Observations:
- The maximum sum of two shovels is `n + (n-1)`.
- The sum of two shovels `i` and `j` is `i + j`.
- To end with a certain number of nines, we focus on the conditions the sum needs to satisfy.
- Specifically, the maximum numbers of trailing nines we can achieve by examining different pairs.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program attempts to find pairs `(i, n - i)` for each shovel from 1 to `n // 2` and check if the cost of the shovel `i` and its counterpart `(n - i)` results in a sum that meets the specified conditions for trailing nines.

#### Review of Logic:
The program has a condition inside the loop:
```python
if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:
```
This is likely trying to check if the sum `i + (n - i)` has trailing nines. However, the calculation is incorrect. The correct way to check how many trailing nines are present would involve more careful handling of the last digits of the sum and likely the overall modular arithmetic with powers of ten.

### Example Case Failing:
For `n = 14`, the pairs that yield sums ending with one nine are:
- `1 and 8` -> 9
- `2 and 7` -> 9
- `3 and 6` -> 9
- `4 and 5` -> 9
- `5 and 14` -> 19
- `6 and 13` -> 19
- `7 and 12` -> 19
- `8 and 11` -> 19
- `9 and 10` -> 19

The intended output is `9`, which the function seems to output correctly, but there’s an underlying issue in how it computes the total pairs based on the trailing nines logic.

If we take `n = 30`, for example, pairs such as `(29, 1)` yield a cost of `30` (0 nines), and a lot more combinations exist that require careful checking.

### Conclusion:
The program does not properly evaluate the maximum trailing nines due to faulty logic in checking the conditions. It fails to handle pairs correctly, leading to wrong counts.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` from input, which should be between 2 and 10^9 inclusive. It then counts how many integer pairs `(i, n - i)` exist for `i` ranging from 1 to `n // 2` such that the sum `i + (n - i)` is a multiple of a power of 10 that corresponds to the number of digits in that sum minus 1. Finally, it prints the count of these valid pairs. Note that the function does not return a value but outputs the result directly via print. There is no handling for invalid input; if the input is outside the specified bounds, the behavior is undefined. Additionally, there's no input mechanism to ensure `n` falls within the required range prior to processing.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
