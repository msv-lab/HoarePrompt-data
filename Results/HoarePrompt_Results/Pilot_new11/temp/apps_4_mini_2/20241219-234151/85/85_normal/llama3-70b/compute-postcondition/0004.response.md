`ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The states of the other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 1, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**
