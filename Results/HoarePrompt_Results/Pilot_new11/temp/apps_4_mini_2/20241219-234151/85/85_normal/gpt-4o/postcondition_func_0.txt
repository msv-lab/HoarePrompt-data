The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and calculates the number of trailing 9s in `n`. It then computes a final value by multiplying `(n + 1)` (after the removal of trailing 9s, resulting in `0`) with the count of how many trailing 9s were present initially. The final output produced by the function is always `0` since `n` becomes `0` after the while loop. Therefore, the function effectively counts the trailing 9s in `n`, but it will always print `0` as a result. The function does not handle invalid input cases or provide guidance when `n` does not meet the condition or contains no trailing 9s.
