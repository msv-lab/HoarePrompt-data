The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means that `n` will take on a new integer value based on the user's input. However, since the input is not given, we can only specify that `n` is now equal to an input integer while retaining the condition that `n` must be between 2 and \(10^9\).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
