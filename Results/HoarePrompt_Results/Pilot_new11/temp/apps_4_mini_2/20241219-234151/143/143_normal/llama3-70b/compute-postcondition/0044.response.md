According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must become 2 (as `j` is incremented at the end of each iteration). This will allow the loop to continue as long as `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `j` is 2, `vol` is 1**
