The value of `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of the current `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. With `i` equal to 1, `i - 1` equals 0. Thus, `dp[i - 1]` corresponds to `dp[0]`. 

Since `dp[i]` has already been updated to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `c[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, and `dp[0]` is also part of that, the specific values of `dp[1]`, `dp[0]`, and their relationship will determine the output. 

We conclude:
- `dp[1]` becomes the minimum of its current value and `dp[0] * 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[1]` in relation to `dp[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp[i]` has been updated to min(`dp[i]`, `c[i]`) for all 0 ≤ i < n; `i` is now 1, `dp[1]` is updated to min(`dp[1]`, `dp[0] * 2`)**.
