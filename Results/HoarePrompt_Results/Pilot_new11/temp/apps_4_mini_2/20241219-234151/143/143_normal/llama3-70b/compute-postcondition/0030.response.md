The variable `vol` is assigned the value of `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is currently `2`, we calculate `vol` as follows:  
- `2 ** j` where `j = 2` equals `4`.  
- Therefore, `vol = 4 - 1` which results in `vol = 3`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2.**
