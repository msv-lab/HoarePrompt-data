Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[i]` is the minimum of all possible sums of `dp[i - (2^j - 1)] + costs[j]` where vol ≤ `i` for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`, other `dp` elements remain float('inf') if not updated; `i` is `L + 1`, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0; the current value of `vol` is less than or equal to `i`.***
