In this case, the code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])` updates the value of `dp[i]`. The variable `vol` is currently 1, and `j` is 1, affecting the calculation. The output of `dp[i]` will be the minimum of its current value or the value of `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`.

Since `n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, and `L` and `costs` maintain their conditions, the other variables (`n`, `L`, `costs`, `j`, and `vol`) remain unchanged. The variable `dp[i]` would have changed based on the minimum value calculated from the mentioned expression.

Therefore, the Output State would summarize the invariant conditions along with the dependency established by the code on the variable `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value or `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`.**
