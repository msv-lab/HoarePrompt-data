Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `dp` is a list of integers with `dp[0]` equal to 0 and other elements initialized to float('inf'). If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `dp[i - 2]` and `costs[n]`.***
