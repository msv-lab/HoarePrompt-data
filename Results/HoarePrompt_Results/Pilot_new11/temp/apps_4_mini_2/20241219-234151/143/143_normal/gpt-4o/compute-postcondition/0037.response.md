The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. Here are the details regarding these parameters:

- `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `L` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\).
- `costs` is a list of integers with length `n`, where each integer \(c_i\) (with \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\)) represents the cost of a bottle of type \(i\).

After executing the function body, it returns the minimum of `answer`'s original value and the sum of `current_cost` plus an adjustment based on the value of `L`. Specifically, `current_cost` is derived from the accumulated costs when specific deductions from `L` are made. The function thus calculates its output based on these input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer), `L` (a positive integer), and `costs` (a list of positive integers representing costs). It returns the minimum value between the original value of `answer` and the sum of `current_cost` and a conditionally added value based on `L`.**
