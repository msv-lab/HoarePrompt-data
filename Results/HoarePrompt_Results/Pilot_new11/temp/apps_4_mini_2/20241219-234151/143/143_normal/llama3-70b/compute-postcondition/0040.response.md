According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate for `j` in the range of `n`, meaning it will execute `n` times, with `j` starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment to 1. Since the loop can execute while `j` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1 and `n` should be within the same range, that is `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` changes from 0 to 1.
- The requirement for `n` remains the same because the loop has to stay within its bounds.

State: **`n` is within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `j` is 1, `vol` is 0**
