Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 30, `L` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `L` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 3. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` may now be less than or equal to its previous value after evaluating `min(dp[i], dp[i - 3] + costs[2])`.***
