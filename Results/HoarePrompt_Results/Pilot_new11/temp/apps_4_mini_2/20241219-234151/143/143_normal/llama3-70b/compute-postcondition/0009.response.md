Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of integers from input, `dp` is a list of integers with `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and other elements are float('inf'). If `vol` (defined as \(2^j - 1\)) is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`, while `i` remains unchanged and `vol` stays equal to \(2^j - 1\).***
