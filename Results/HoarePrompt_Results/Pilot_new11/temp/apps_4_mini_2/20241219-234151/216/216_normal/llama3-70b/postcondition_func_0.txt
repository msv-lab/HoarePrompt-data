The function reads an integer n and a string s from user input. It then counts the number of lowercase letters in the string s and prints this count. The inputs are constrained such that n is between 1 and 200, and the length of s matches this value. The function does not return a value but outputs the count of lowercase letters directly. Notably, the function lacks error handling for unexpected input formats and does not validate that the length of s is equal to n, which could lead to potential inconsistencies if the input is incorrect.
