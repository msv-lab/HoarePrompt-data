You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze what the program is doing in conjunction with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in a "pretty" set of positions from a string. 
- The conditions for a pretty set are that:
  1. All letters at those positions must be distinct and lowercase.
  2. No uppercase letters can be positioned between any two positions in the set.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. The program reads an integer `n`, and then reads a string `s`.
2. It initializes counters and sets to track distinct lowercase letters.
3. As it iterates through each character in the string:
   - If the character is lowercase and not in the set, it adds it to the set and increments the count of distinct lowercase letters.
   - If the character is uppercase, it updates the maximum count found so far, clears the set and resets the count.
4. After iterating, it checks once more to ensure the last segment of lowercase letters is considered for the maximum count.

### Edge Cases:
1. **All Uppercase Letters:** 
   - Input: `3\nABC\n` should return `0`. The code handles this correctly, as it would never enter the lowercase counting phase.
   
2. **All Lowercase Letters:**
   - Input: `5\nabcde\n` should return `5`. The program would successfully count all distinct letters.
   
3. **Letters Mixed with Uppercase:**
   - Input: `12\nzACaAbbaazzC\n`
     - The pretty sets could be formed from segments like `z`, `a` (from the 3rd, 5th, 8th, and 11th positions). The code will correctly separate segments and maximize the count because it clears with every uppercase letter.

4. **Repeated Characters:** 
   - Input: `6\naaaAAA\n` should yield `1`. The program will capture that only `a` is unique before it encounters the uppercase.

### Finding Potential Failures:
I examined the provided function for logical errors or missed edge cases. The primary concern could be whether it resets too aggressively, but it appears to correctly manage various segments separated by uppercase letters. 

**However**, consider the failure for non-unique letters:
- Input: `6\nabcdAB\n`
   - This should return `4`, as we have all distinct lowercase letters. The program works here as well as it captures `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

After testing various potential cases, every logical scenario from the initial problem description seems to be handled correctly by the given code. 

### Conclusion
I could not identify a scenario where the program fails, indicating it fulfills the problem requirements. Thus:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions based on the description and includes handling of edge cases adequately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_count` is the maximum number of unique lowercase letters in any contiguous segment of lowercase letters in `s`; `current_set` is empty, and `current_count` is 0 after the last character has been processed. If `s` contains no lowercase letters, `max_count` will be 0.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of letters in a case-sensitive manner. It calculates and prints the maximum number of unique lowercase letters found in any contiguous segment of `s` consisting solely of lowercase letters. If no lowercase letters are present in `s`, it will return 0. The function maintains a count of unique lowercase letters and resets this count whenever an uppercase letter is encountered, thus only counting segments of lowercase letters. The final output is the maximum count found across all segments processed.
