In the given code snippet, `max_count` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the value of `current_count`. The variables `n`, `s`, and `char` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. The state of `max_count` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `char` is the third character in `s`; `max_count` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`.**
