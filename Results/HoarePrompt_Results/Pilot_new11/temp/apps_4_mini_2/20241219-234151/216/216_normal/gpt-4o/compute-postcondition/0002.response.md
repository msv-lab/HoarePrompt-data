The variable `max_count` is assigned the value `0`. There are no previous values of `max_count`, as it was not defined before this line. The other variables retain their states as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `max_count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `max_count` is 0.**
