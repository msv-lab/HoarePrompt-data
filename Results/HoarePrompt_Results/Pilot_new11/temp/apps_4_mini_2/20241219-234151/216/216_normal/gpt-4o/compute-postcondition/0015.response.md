Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, and `char` is the first character in `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` is updated to include `char`, and `current_count` is incremented by 1. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `current_set` remains unchanged, and `current_count` remains 0.***
