The variable `current_count` is being incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_count` is unknown, but it is affected by the execution of the code. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `s` is a string of length `n`; `char` is the third character in `s`; `current_set` now includes `char`; `current_count` is increased by 1.**
