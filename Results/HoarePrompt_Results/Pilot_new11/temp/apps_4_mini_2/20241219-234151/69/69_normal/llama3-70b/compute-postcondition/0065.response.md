The value of `dx` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `dx` is `x - ux`, where `ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux - 1`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `res` is 0, and there must be at least one more operation remaining in `ops` for the loop to execute again.**
