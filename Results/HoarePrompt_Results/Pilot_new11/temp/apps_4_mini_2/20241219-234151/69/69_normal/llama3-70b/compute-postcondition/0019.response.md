Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `ops` is a string of length `n`, and `op` is the first character of `ops`. If `op` is equal to 'U', then `uy` is increased by 1. If `op` is not 'U' and if it is 'D', then `uy` is reduced by 1. If `op` is neither 'U' nor 'D', and if `op` is 'R', then `ux` is increased by 1; if `op` is 'L', then `ux` is decremented by 1.***
