The value of `final_y` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and that `operations` is a string, along with `op`, which represents the next character in `operations`. The other variables (`n`, `operations`, and `op`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the next character in `operations`, and `final_y` has decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the next character in `operations`, `final_y` has decreased by 1**.
