The value of `uy` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unaffected because there are no interactions with `n`, `ops`, or `op`. Since there is no information about the initial value of `uy`, it is sufficient to state that it has been decreased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ops` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the second character of `ops`, `uy` is decreased by 1.**
