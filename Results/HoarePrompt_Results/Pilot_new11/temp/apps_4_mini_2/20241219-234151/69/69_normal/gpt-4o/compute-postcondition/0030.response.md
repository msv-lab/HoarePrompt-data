The variable `final_x` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The variable `final_x` will now hold a value that is one less than its previous value. However, since the initial value of `final_x` is not provided, we denote it as undefined. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `final_x` has been decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200001), `operations` is a string of length `n + 1`, and `final_x` is decreased by 1.**
