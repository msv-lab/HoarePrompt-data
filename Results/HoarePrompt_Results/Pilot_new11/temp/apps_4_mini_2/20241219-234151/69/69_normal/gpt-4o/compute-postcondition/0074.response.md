Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements. When `operations[i]` is 'D', `current_y` is decreased by 1 and `position_map` contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 1`. If `operations[i]` is 'L', then `position_map` contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 0`. If `operations[i]` is 'R', then `current_x` is updated to `current_x + 1` and `position_map` contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 1`.***
