Postcondition: ***`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux - 1`, while `dy` remains as `y - uy`, and `res` remains 0, with at least one more operation remaining in `ops`. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux + 1`, `dy` remains as `y - uy`, and `res` remains 0, ensuring there is still at least one more operation in `ops`. Otherwise, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is set to 1, with at least one more operation remaining in `ops.***
