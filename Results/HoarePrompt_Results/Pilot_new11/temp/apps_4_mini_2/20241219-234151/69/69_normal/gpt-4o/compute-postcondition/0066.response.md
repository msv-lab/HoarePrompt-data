The code assigns a value to an entry in the `position_map` dictionary, mapping the tuple `(current_x, current_y)` to the value of `i`. The previous states of `final_x`, `final_y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `position_map` is updated. The specific values of `current_x` and `current_y` are not provided, and thus `position_map` gets a new entry based on their respective values.

Output State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 0, and `position_map` now contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = i.`**
