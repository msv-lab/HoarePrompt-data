Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements; `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`. If `target_pos` is not found in `position_map`, no changes occur to `min_length`.***
