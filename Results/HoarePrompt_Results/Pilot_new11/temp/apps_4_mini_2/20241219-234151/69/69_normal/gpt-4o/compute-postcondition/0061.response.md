Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), and `i` is 0. If the operation at index `i` is 'U', then `current_y` is incremented by 1. If the operation at index `i` is 'D', then `current_y` is decreased by 1. If the operation at index `i` is 'L', then `current_x` is decreased by 1. If the operation at index `i` is 'R', then `current_x` is incremented by 1. If the operation at index `i` is neither 'U', 'D', 'L', nor 'R', the values of `final_x`, `final_y`, and `current_x` remain unchanged.***
