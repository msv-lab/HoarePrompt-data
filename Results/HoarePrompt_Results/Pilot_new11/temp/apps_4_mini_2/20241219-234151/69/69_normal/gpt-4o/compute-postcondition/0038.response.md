To determine the output state after executing the code, we start with the initial state:

- `final_x` is the result of the net movements in the horizontal direction calculated as (number of 'R' - number of 'L').
- `final_y` is the result of the net movements in the vertical direction calculated as (number of 'U' - number of 'D').
- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000).
- `operations` is a string of length `n`.
- `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`.

Now, executing the provided code:
```
dy = y - final_y
```

This line assigns to `dy` the value of `y` subtracted by `final_y`. The value of `dy` is directly determined from the current values of `y` and `final_y`, and this calculation will not affect any other variables.

The important observations here are:
- The values of both `y` and `final_y` are not directly altered, but `dy` is now computed based on their current values.
  
Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dy` has been determined while all other variable conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`final_x` is the result of the net movements in the horizontal direction calculated as (number of 'R' - number of 'L'); `final_y` is the result of the net movements in the vertical direction calculated as (number of 'U' - number of 'D'); `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); `operations` is a string of length `n`; `dx` is equal to `x - final_x`; `dy` is equal to `y - final_y`.**
