After running the code snippet that increments `final_x` by 1, the value of `final_x` changes while the other variables remain unaffected. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, and `operations` and `op` maintain their respective states as well. 

Here's the summary:
- `final_x` is increased by 1.
- The other variables retain their previous definitions and values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `operations` is a string of length `n`, `op` is the next character in `operations`, `final_x` is incremented by 1, and `final_y` remains unchanged.**
