The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\). 
- `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. 
- `x` and `y` are integers with \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).

After executing the function body, there are two cases for the return values:
- Case_1: The function returns `0`.
- Case_2: The function returns `min_length` if it is not positive infinity; otherwise, it returns `-1`, indicating whether a sequence of movements exists that returns to the same position.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`, and determine if a sequence of movements leads back to the original position, returning specific values based on the outcome. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, operations, x, and y, and returns 0 or determines if a sequence of movements returns to the original position, returning min_length or -1 accordingly.**
