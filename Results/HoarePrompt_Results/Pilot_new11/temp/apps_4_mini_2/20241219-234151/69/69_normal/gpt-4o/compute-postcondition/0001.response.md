The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `final_y`. 

The initial state specifies that `final_x` is already `0`, and the new assignment does not change the values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, or `y`. 

Therefore, the updated output state includes the information about `final_y`, which is now defined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000); `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'; `x` and `y` are integers with -10^9 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9; `final_x` is 0; `final_y` is 0.**
