You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code logic.

### Analyzing the Problem Description:
1. The robot starts from the origin (0, 0) and performs a series of operations, represented by a string comprising the characters U, D, L, and R.
2. After performing the operations, we need to determine if it can reach a specified coordinate (x, y) with the minimum number of changes to the operation sequence.
3. If the destination is unreachable, the function should return `-1`.

### Analyzing the Provided Code:

- **Counting the final position after operations**: 
  The initial loop correctly counts the final position `(ux, uy)` by incrementing and decrementing based on the operations.

- **Calculating required changes**:
  - The required differences `dx` and `dy` are computed by subtracting the achieved position from the target position.
  - If either `dx` or `dy` is negative after computing required differences, it indicates that the robot cannot reach the target location simply by modifying operations.

- **Counting changes to achieve `(x, y)`**:
  - The second loop adjusts `dy` and `dx` based on the current operation, checking if it's possible to satisfy the target with the currently executed commands. If it can satisfy but does not, it increments the `res` counter to count the necessary changes.

### Problematic Case:
The issue arises when the calculations of changes are made when `dx` and `dy` are not met. The code could potentially fail if:
1. The robot already has excess steps in one direction (i.e., moves correct commands) but doesn't handle the cases when operations can be exchanged correctly to meet the final position.

For example:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  2
  RR
  -1 0
  ```
  Here, `dx = -1`, `dy = 0`. The program will incorrectly state that it is impossible to reach `(-1, 0)` because it checks only the `dx < 0` and `dy < 0` conditions separately. In fact, it should also consider if there are enough left operations `L` to switch to achieve that move.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program can fail to correctly ascertain whether or not it can reach the destination in certain situations, this leads me to conclude that the program does not fulfill the problem requirements in every case.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (1 <= n <= 200000), ops is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and x and y are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    ux, uy, lx, ly = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ux` is equal to the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`; `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`; `ops` is a string of length `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer.
    dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy
    if (dx < 0 or dy < 0) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `res` is the count of operations in `ops` that could not make a valid movement according to the conditions of the loop. If the loop does not execute, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `res` retain their initial calculated values based on `ops`.
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`ux` is equal to the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`; `uy` is equal to the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`; `dx` is equal to `x - ux`; `dy` is equal to `y - uy`; if either `dx` or `dy` is less than 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `res` is printed reflecting the count of invalid operations in `ops`.
