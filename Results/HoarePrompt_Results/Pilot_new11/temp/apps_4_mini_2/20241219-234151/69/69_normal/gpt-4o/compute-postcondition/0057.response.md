The code `current_x += 1` increments the value of `current_x` by 1. The initial values of `final_x` and `final_y` are unchanged. The variable `i` remains at 0, and `n` is ensured to be a positive integer. 

The value of `current_x` updates, but its previous value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the specific change to `current_x` cannot be determined. 

Output State: **`final_x` is the result of net movements, `final_y` is the result of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 0, the operation at index `i` is 'R', `current_x` is incremented by 1.**
