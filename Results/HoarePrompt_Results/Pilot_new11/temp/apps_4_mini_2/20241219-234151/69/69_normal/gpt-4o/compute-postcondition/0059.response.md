Postcondition: ***`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements. If the operation at index `i` is 'L', then `current_x` is decreased by 1. If the operation at index `i` is 'R', then `current_x` is incremented by 1. If the operation at index `i` is neither 'R' nor 'L', the values of `final_x`, `final_y`, and `current_x` remain unchanged.***
