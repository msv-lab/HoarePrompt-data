Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200001) and `operations` is a string of length `n + 1`. If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is increased by 1. If `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R', `final_x` remains unchanged.***
