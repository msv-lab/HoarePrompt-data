The code initializes the variables `ux`, `uy`, `lx`, and `ly` to 0 without affecting the values of `n`, `ops`, `x`, and `y`. Therefore, the output state will maintain the previous values of all variables while updating the initialized variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `ops` is a string of length `n`; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer; `ux` is 0; `uy` is 0; `lx` is 0; `ly` is 0.**
