In the given situation, the operation at index `i` is 'L', which implies that the movement is to the left along the x-axis (decreasing `current_x` by 1). The variable `current_x` is decremented by 1.

### Breakdown of the variables:
- `final_x` is the result of net movements (value remains unchanged).
- `final_y` is the result of net movements (value remains unchanged).
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) (value remains unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (value remains unchanged).
- The operation at index `i` is not 'D' (remains unchanged).
- The operation at index `i` is 'L' (which leads to the execution of the line of code).

### Calculation:
- `current_x` is decremented by 1, resulting in `current_x` being reduced by 1.

### Updated State:
Since `current_x` is not defined in the initial state but it's impacted directly by the operation specified in the code, we will not represent `current_x` directly but state its change implicitly.

Output State: **`final_x` is the result of net movements, `final_y` is the result of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 0, the operation at index `i` is not 'D', the operation at index `i` is 'L', and `current_x` is decreased by 1.**
