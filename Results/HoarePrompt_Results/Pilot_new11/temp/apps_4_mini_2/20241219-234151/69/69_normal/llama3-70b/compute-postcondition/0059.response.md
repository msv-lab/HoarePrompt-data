Postcondition: ***`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, if `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1 while `dy` remains equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is still 0. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1, ensuring `dx` is less than or equal to 0, while `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, and `res` is incremented by 1 from 0. For any other value of `op`, `dx` remains as `x - ux`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, and the conditions regarding `ops`, `res`, and directional movements specified in the precondition are satisfied.***
