According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. Since `n` is at least 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be 1 for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`final_x` and `final_y` are the results of net movements, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 200000), `i` is 1, and `position_map` now contains an entry for `(current_x, current_y) = 1.`**
