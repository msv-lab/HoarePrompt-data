The statement `dx -= 1` decrements the value of `dx` by 1. The previous conditions indicate that `dx` was greater than 0, meaning that the new value of `dx` will be at least 0 after this decrement. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the modified value of `dx`.

Output State: **`ux` is the number of 'R' in `ops` minus the number of 'L' in `ops`, `uy` is the number of 'U' in `ops` minus the number of 'D' in `ops`, `dx` is equal to `x - ux - 1`, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`, `ops` is a non-empty string of length greater than 0, `res` is 0, either `op` is not 'U' or `dy` is less than or equal to 0, it is not the case that `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, `op` is 'R', and `dx` is greater than 0.**
