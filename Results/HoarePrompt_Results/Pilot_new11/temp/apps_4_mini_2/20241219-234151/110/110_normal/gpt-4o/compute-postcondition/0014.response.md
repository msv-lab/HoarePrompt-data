According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` in relation to `m`. The loop iterates over `y` from 0 to `m-1`, so to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1. Therefore, to execute one more time, `y` should become 2. 

Additionally, we know that `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, which means for `y` to be valid for the next iteration, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m + 2` elements: (-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), ..., (-coverage(0, m-1), 0, m-1), (-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0), (-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1), and `x` is 1, `y` is 2**
