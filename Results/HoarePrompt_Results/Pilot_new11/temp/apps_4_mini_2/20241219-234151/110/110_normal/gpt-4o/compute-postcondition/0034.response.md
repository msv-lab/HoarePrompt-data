The values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the first three elements popped from the `heap`. After this operation, the size of `heap` will decrease by 3 elements. The values of `cov`, `x`, and `y` will be the first, second, and third smallest elements of the initial heap, respectively. `total_coverage` remains unchanged at `-2 * cov`, and `k` is decremented by 1, so it remains greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `heap` contains `n * m - 4 - 3 = n * m - 7` elements, `cov` is the first popped element from the heap, `x` is the second popped element from the heap, `y` is the third popped element from the heap, `total_coverage` remains equal to `-2 * cov`, and `k` is now equal to the previous value of `k - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `heap` contains `n * m - 7` elements, `cov` is the first element popped from the heap, `x` is the second element popped from the heap, `y` is the third element popped from the heap, `total_coverage` is equal to `-2 * cov`, `k` is adjusted to be `k - 1`.**
