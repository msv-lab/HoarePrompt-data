The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new tuple into the `heap`. The first component of the tuple is `-coverage(x, y)`, where `x` is currently `0` and `y` is currently `1`. Therefore, `-coverage(0, 1)` becomes the first element of the tuple.

The other two elements of the tuple are `x` and `y`, which remain unchanged as `0` and `1`, respectively. The `heap` initially contains one element: `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`. After the new element is added, the heap will now contain two elements: the original one plus the new one formed from `(-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1)`.

The previous conditions for `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` are not affected as this operation only modifies the `heap`. 

Thus the output state reflects the updated `heap`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains two elements: (-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0) and (-coverage(0, 1), 0, 1), `x` is 0, `y` is 1**
