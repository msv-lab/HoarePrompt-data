Functionality: **The function accepts four integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` from user input, which must fall within specific ranges. It computes the value `ans` as the minimum between `k` and the area equivalent to a rectangle formed in a grid defined by the dimensions `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`. The function then outputs the result of dividing `ans` by the area `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. If the area is zero (which can occur if `r` is equal to `n` or `m`), dividing by zero will result in an error. Therefore, the function should ideally handle cases where `n` or `m` is equal to `r` to avoid undefined behavior. The function primarily produces a floating-point output based on the computed values.**
