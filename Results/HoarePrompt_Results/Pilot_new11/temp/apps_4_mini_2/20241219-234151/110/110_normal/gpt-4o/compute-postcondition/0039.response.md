The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters are defined as follows: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows in the pond; `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns in the pond; `r` is a positive integer indicating the size of the scoop-net; and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of fishes to be placed in distinct cells of the pond. After executing the function body, it calculates `total_coverage` as the negative sum of the first `k` covariance values and `total_positions` as the product of `(n - r + 1)` and `(m - r + 1)`. The function ultimately returns the value of `total_coverage` divided by `total_positions`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, and return the ratio of total coverage (calculated from negative covariance values) to total positions in the pond. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, and k, all positive integers, and returns the ratio of total coverage to total positions in the pond.**
