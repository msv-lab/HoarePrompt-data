According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 since `x` will be incremented by 1. After the increment, `x` will be 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m + m` elements: (-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), ..., (-coverage(0, m-1), 0, m-1), (-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0), ..., (-coverage(1, m-1), 1, m-1), `x` is 2, `y` is `m`.**
