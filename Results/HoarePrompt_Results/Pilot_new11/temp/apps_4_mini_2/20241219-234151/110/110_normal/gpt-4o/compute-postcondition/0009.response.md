According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop is currently set to execute at least once more as `0 < n`. 

At the start of the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again after this iteration, `n` must be greater than 1 because `x` will be updated to 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `heap` contains `m` elements: (-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0), ..., (-coverage(0, m-1), 0, m-1), `x` is 1, `y` is `m - 1`.**
