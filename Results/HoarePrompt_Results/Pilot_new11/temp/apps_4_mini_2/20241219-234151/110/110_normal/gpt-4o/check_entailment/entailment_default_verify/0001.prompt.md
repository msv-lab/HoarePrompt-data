You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

#Function 2:
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the implementation step by step.

### Program Analysis

1. **Functionality**:
   - **Inputs**: The program takes four integers: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`.
   - It uses a heap to manage cells and their coverage for where fish can be placed.
   - The `coverage` function calculates the number of positions a scoop can catch fish if the lower-left corner of the scoop is at cell `(x, y)`.
   - The main function (`func_1`) attempts to maximize the total expected value of fishes caught.

2. **Coverage Calculation**:
   - The `coverage` function attempts to calculate how many scoop positions can catch fish from the point `(x, y)`. However, the logic is not defensively handling edge cases around the boundaries of the pond. 

3. **Heap Functionality**:
   - The heap is built from the cells (x, y) based on the negative coverage that the scoop can have. This allows the highest coverage to be popped first.
   - The program fetches `k` cells from the heap. If `k` exceeds valid placements or the cells selected have low coverage, the expected number of fishes caught may not represent the optimal placement.

### Finding Potential Failure Cases

To find whether this implementation can fail, consider edge cases:
- Placing more fishes than the number of `r × r` placements.
- How the coverage function behaves at the edges of the pond, especially when `x` or `y` are near their limits.

### Example to Test

Let’s examine an example where the placement of fishes leads to unexpected behavior:

- **Case**: Input `n = 3, m = 3, r = 3, k = 3`
    - The whole pond is 3x3 and we try to place 3 fishes while the scoop fills the entire pond.
    - Expected coverage should allow capturing all fishes since the scoop can only fit in one position, covering all fishes.
    
### Analysis of Failure

1. After placing the fishes, it checks coverage at possible `k` choices. Since all fishes are placed without consideration of total coverage (which is 9 as all positions contribute to coverage here), the logic fails because it assumes dynamic positions rather than holistic coverage. 
2. Since overlapping scenarios are not well defined in the coverage function, the potential for wrong averaged counts exists.

### Verdict

Given that the implementation of the coverage logic does not handle all edge cases properly, specifically in scenarios where the fish must share overlapping coverage in tight spaces, and can return incorrect expectations of fish catch, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for optimal placement and coverage in specific edge cases, which can lead to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `coverage` calculates the area of a scoop-net based on its coordinates `(x, y)` within a rectangular pond defined by dimensions `(n, m)`, and a size parameter `r`. It computes how much of the scoop-net fits within the boundaries of the pond, ensuring that it does not exceed the pond's dimensions. The function calculates this by determining the effective width and height that the scoop-net can occupy given the parameters, and returns the product of these dimensions. If the scoop-net is completely out of bounds, it could potentially return a negative or zero area due to the calculation method, indicating an edge case where the scoop-net does not fit at all. Overall, it assumes the parameters `n`, `m`, and `r` are defined globally or are present elsewhere in the code, as they are not passed as arguments and their states are essential for the calculation.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
