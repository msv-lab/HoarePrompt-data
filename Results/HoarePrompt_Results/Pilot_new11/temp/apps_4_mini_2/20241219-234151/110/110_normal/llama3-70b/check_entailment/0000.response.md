To determine if the given program correctly calculates the expected number of caught fishes as per the problem description, let’s analyze its logic.

The problem requires placing `k` fishes on an `n x m` grid such that when a square scoop of size `r x r` is placed randomly, the expected number of fishes caught is maximized. The expected number of fishes that can be caught is derived from the number of positions the scoop can occupy, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.

The program logic does two main things:
1. It calculates the number of unique positions the scoop can occupy.
2. It attempts to place `k` fishes in such a way that they fit into these scoop positions, but if `k` exceeds the number of available scoop positions, it limits the placement to the available positions.

Here’s a breakdown of the program:

1. `ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` effectively ensures that you only consider the minimum of `k` or the total available scoop positions. This is appropriate as you cannot place more fishes than available scoop positions.

2. The expected value calculation divides the number of fishes that can be caught (`ans`) by the number of positions that scoop can take, yielding the average or expected number of fishes caught when the scoop is placed randomly.

However, let's consider edge cases:

- If `k` is greater than `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, the code does limit `ans` correctly, but it does not correctly calculate the average expected value since averaging over positions when `k` is more than the scraping positions does not mean every position has fish. 

- When `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and `r = 1`, if there is only one cell and one fish, the expected value should be `1.0`, but due to division logic, if `k` were more than `1`, it would cap at that single cell, leading to a division issue. 

Although the program seems to handle many cases appropriately, it does not take care of the scenarios when the number of fishes exceeds the number of scoop positions properly when calculating averages which could lead to an unexpected result.

For instance, given inputs: 
```
1 1 1 1
```
The expected output should be `1.0`, as you have one fish in one position for one scoop position. But if you have more fishes than positions:
```
3 3 2 10
```
It will still output an average but has too many assumptions based on valid placements rather than distinct positions.

Therefore, considering these points and potential edge cases:

Correctness: **False**. 

This is due to the fact that the expected number of caught fishes may not be accurately conveyed when `k` is significantly larger than the available positions or when it is improperly derived at edge cases like above noted.
