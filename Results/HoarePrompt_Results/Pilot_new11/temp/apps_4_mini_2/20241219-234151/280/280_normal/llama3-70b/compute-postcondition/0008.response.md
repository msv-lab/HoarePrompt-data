Output State: **`t` is within 2 to 100; `d` is between 0 and 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged; `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`; `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed);` `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`; `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`; `i` is `t - 1`.**
