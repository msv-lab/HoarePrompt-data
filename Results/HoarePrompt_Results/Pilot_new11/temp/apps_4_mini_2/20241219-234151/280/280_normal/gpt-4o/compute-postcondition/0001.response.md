The values of `t` and `d` are updated based on the input, where the function `map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input and splits it into two integers. The initial conditions state that `t` must be within the range of 2 to 100 and `d` must be within the range of 0 to 10. The values of `v_1` and `v_2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10 after being updated with input values.**
