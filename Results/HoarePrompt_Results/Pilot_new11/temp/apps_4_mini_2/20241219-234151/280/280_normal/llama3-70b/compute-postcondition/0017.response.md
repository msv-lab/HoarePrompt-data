Output State: **`t` must be at least 4; `d` is between 0 and 10; `v1` remains unchanged; `v2` remains unchanged; `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`; `min_speed` remains unchanged; `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t + 2 * max_speed`; `min_length` is equal to `(min_speed * (t + 1) + min_speed)`; `i` is `t - 3`**
