To analyze the code:

1. The variable `i` is currently 3.
2. The expression `speeds[i]` will be assigned the result of `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.
3. We know that `speeds[i - 1]` corresponds to `speeds[2]`, which is already calculated as `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`.
4. We need the values of `d`, `v_2`, and `t` to compute this correctly.

Since we aren't provided with the specific values for `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`, the calculation for `speeds[3]` will rely on the defined relationships rather than exact numerical values. However, we can express the new value for `speeds[3]`.

The updated calculation for `speeds[i] = speeds[3]` will thus be:

`speeds[3] = min(speeds[2] + d, v_2 + (t - 4) * d)`

Therefore:
- `speeds[2]` takes the previously defined value of `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`.
- The relationships of other variables `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, `d` and `speeds` are still held as true after executing the code.

Thus, the final output state will indicate that `speeds[3]` is defined based on these expressions rather than numerical values.

Output State: **`v_1` is the first input integer, `v_2` is the second input integer, `t` must be greater than 3, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `speeds[0]` equal to `v_1`, `speeds[1]` equal to `min(v_1 + d, v_2 + (t - 2) * d)`, `speeds[2]` equal to `min(speeds[1] + d, v_2 + (t - 3) * d)`, `speeds[3]` equal to `min(speeds[2] + d, v_2 + (t - 4) * d)`, `speeds[-1]` equal to `v_2`, `i` is 3**.
