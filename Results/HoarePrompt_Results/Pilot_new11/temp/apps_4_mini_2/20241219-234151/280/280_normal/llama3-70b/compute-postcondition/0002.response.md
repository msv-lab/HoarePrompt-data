The code `max_speed = max(v1, v2)` assigns to `max_speed` the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`. As the variables `t` and `d` remain unchanged and the other variables are not affected, the output state will retain the information about `t`, `d`, `v1`, and `v2`. 

Therefore, since `max_speed` is now defined by the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, we can denote that accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is the new input integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is the new input integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged; `max_speed` is the maximum value of `v1` and `v2`.**
