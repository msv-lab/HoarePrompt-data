The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly in its definition. However, it works with the understanding that certain constraints apply to four integer values: `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`, which must meet the following conditions: 
- `v_1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v_1 \leq 100\)
- `v_2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v_2 \leq 100\)
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\)
- `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)

Since the provided output for the function is not specified, we are unable to assert what values the function returns. Based on this information, we can summarize the functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters (v_1, v_2, t, d) with specified integer constraints but does not accept these parameters directly in its definition. The return value is not specified.**
