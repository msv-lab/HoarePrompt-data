The values of `t` and `d` are being updated by taking input values and converting them into integers. The previous values of `t` and `d` are still valid, but they will be replaced by the new input values. The conditions for `t` (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) and `d` (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) will still apply based on the new inputs.

Output State: **`t` is the new input integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is the new input integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.**
