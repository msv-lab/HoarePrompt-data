You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step:

1. The program reads two speeds, `v1` and `v2`, and two conditions: time `t` and maximum speed change `d`.

2. It calculates the maximum and minimum speeds and starts by assuming the maximum possible path length is `max_speed * t`.

3. The loop iterates through the remaining seconds, attempting to adjust the speeds while maintaining the constraints given (i.e., the speed can change by at most `d` between any two adjacent seconds).

4. It attempts to update `max_speed` and `min_speed` based on the constraints and adds the respective speeds to `max_length` and `min_length`.

5. Finally, it outputs the maximum length of the path.

### Potential Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**:
    Input:
    ```
    5 7
    4 3
    ```
    Here, `v1` = 5 and `v2` = 7. The car can start at 5 m/s, reach a maximum of 8 m/s in between (increasing by 3 at max), and must end at 7 m/s.
    - Possible speed sequence: 5 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 (results in 5 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 26).
    
- **Test Case 2**:
    Input:
    ```
    1 10
    10 1
    ```
    Here, `v1` = 1 and `v2` = 10. The range of possible speeds means that the speed can increment by 1 at every second to reach 10 at the last second though it seems constrained by d too.
    The possible speeds could look like:
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 results in 55 meters.
  
### Conflict Case:
Now, consider the situation:
- When `t=2` and `d=0` for the case of maximum speed change allowed:
    Input:
    ```
    10 10
    2 0
    ```
    Here the output should be 20 (10 + 10) as it does 10 m/s for 2 seconds, but it is seen that the loop calculates and can affect based on adding the speeds even when the time is short.

The loop logic may misrepresent cases when there's only 1 interval as it's designed for multiple intervals where speeds can change, but when `t=2` and `d=0`, the output consistently but wrongly shows additional calculations.

Furthermore, with values for `t` that lead to extreme values of `d`, it's seen that the addition might not engage in a complete sense.

### Conclusion:
The program fails in scenarios where:
- Minimal time (t=2) and no speed changes (d=0), leading to potentially erroneous outcomes based on loop calculations.

Given the inconsistencies at edge cases:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers from user input: v1, v2 (speeds), t (time), and d (speed variation). It calculates the maximum and minimum possible distances traveled over the time period t based on the given speed variations. Specifically, it iterates through the time decrementing the maximum speed by d (until it reaches the minimum speed) and incrementing the minimum speed by d (until it reaches the current maximum speed). After performing these calculations, it sums the adjusted maximum and minimum speeds to compute the total maximum distance traveled. The function then prints the final total maximum distance calculated. Notably, the function does not directly take parameters and has no explicit return value; the result is printed instead. Additionally, while the function manages speeds and distances, it does not handle potential invalid user inputs (e.g., ensuring inputs comply with stated constraints).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
