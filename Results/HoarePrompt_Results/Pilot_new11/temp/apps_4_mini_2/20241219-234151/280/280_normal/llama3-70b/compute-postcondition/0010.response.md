The statement `min_length += min_speed` increases the value of `min_length` by the current value of `min_speed`. Prior to this operation, we have the following conditions:

- `t` is within 2 to 100.
- `d` is between 0 and 10.
- `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.
- `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.
- `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.
- `max_length` is equal to `(max_speed * t) + max_speed`.
- `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * t`.
- `i` is `t - 1`.

After executing the code `min_length += min_speed`, we can determine how `min_length` is affected:

- `min_length` will now be equal to its prior value (which was `min_speed * t`) plus the current value of `min_speed`. Hence, the updated value for `min_length` can be expressed as:
  
  \[
  \text{min_length} = (\text{min_speed} * t) + \text{min_speed}
  \]
  
This simplifies to:

\[
\text{min_length} = \text{min_speed} * (t + 1)
\]

No other values or conditions have changed. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is within 2 to 100; `d` is between 0 and 10; `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged; `max_speed` is updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`; `min_speed` is equal to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`; `max_length` is equal to `(max_speed * t) + max_speed`; `min_length` is equal to `min_speed * (t + 1)`; `i` is `t - 1`.**
