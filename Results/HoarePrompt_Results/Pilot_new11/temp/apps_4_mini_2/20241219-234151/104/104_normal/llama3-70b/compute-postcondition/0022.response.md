Postcondition: ***`max_erase` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and 1. The values of `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 3. If the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds true, then `max_erase` acknowledges the new value based on the condition. If the condition does not hold, `max_erase` remains as it was, since there is no else part defined.***
