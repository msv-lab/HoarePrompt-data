According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts iterating from `1` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `1`. Since we already know that `n` is a positive integer based on user input (within the range of `1` to `100`), the necessary condition for the loop to run is that `n` must be at least `2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will take the value of `n-1`. Thus, we need to keep track of this value as well.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 1**
