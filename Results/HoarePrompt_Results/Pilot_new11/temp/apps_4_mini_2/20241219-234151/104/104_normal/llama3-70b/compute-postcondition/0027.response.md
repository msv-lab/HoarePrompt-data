According to the code, the loop can continue executing if the index `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, meaning the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 because `i` will now be 2.

State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all valid values of `j` where the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` holds true, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
