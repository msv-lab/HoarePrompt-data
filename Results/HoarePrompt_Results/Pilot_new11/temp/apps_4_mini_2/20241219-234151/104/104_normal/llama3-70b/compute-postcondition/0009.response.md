`max_erase` is assigned the value of the maximum of `max_erase` and `j - i - 1`. Given that `max_erase` is initially 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2, we can compute `j - i - 1` as follows:

- `j - i - 1 = 2 - 0 - 1 = 1`

Now, we take the maximum of 0 and 1, which is 1. Therefore, the value of `max_erase` is updated to 1.

The states of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new value of `max_erase`.

Output State: **`max_erase` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
