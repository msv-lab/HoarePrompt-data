Output State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` for all `j` where the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` holds true, `i` is 0, and `j` ranges from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If the loop does not execute, `max_erase` remains 0.**
