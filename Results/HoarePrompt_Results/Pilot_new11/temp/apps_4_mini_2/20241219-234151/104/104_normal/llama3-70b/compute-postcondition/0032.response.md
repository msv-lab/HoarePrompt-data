According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop runs with `j` starting at `i + 1` (which is 3) up to `n + 1`. The current value of `j` is 3, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we need to ensure that `j` can increment to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` can increment to 4, meaning `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to run again.

Thus, the state needs to be modified as follows:
State: **`max_erase` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
