In this code snippet, `max_erase` gets updated based on the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`. Given that `n` is greater than 1 and `a` is a strictly increasing list of integers, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` will yield a non-negative result. 

1. `max_erase` is initially the maximum value between itself and `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`. 
2. `a[i]` refers to the value of `a` at index `2` (since `i` is `2`) and `a[i - 1]` refers to the value at index `1`.
3. `max_erase` will be updated to the greater of its current value and the computed value based on the integer difference minus one.

Let's denote:
- `a[1]` as `v1` and `a[2]` as `v2`. Since `1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000`, it follows that `v1` and `v2` will be within this range.

Thus, if we compute `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1`:
- This simplifies to `v2 - v1 - 1`, which represents the gap between the two elements minus one.

The two possible values for `max_erase`:
1. If `max_erase` was already greater than or equal to `v2 - v1 - 1`, it remains the same.
2. If `max_erase` was less than `v2 - v1 - 1`, it gets updated to `v2 - v1 - 1`.

Therefore, the possible updated states indicate how `max_erase` changes based on the computation:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 1000, `max_erase` is the maximum value between `max_erase` and `a[2] - a[1] - 1`, `i` is 2**.
