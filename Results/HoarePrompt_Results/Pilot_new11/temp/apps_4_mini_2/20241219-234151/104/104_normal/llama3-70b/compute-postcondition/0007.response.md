Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1, the function checks if the condition `all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)))` holds true. If it is true, the specific handling for that case can be executed; otherwise, no else part exists, and no changes occur in the state.***
