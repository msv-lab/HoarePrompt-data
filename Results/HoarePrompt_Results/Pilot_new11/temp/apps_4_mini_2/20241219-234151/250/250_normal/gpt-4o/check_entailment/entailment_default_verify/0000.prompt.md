You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    marks_set = set(marks)
    x_found = False
    y_found = False
    for mark in marks:
        if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set:
            x_found = True
        if mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set:
            y_found = True
        if x_found and y_found:
            break
    if x_found and y_found:
        print(0)
    else:
        new_marks = set()
        for mark in marks:
            if not x_found:
                if mark + x + y in marks_set or mark + x - y in marks_set or mark - x + y in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark + x)
                elif mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark - x)
            if not y_found:
                if mark + y + x in marks_set or mark + y - x in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark + y)
                elif mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark - y)
        if new_marks:
            print(1)
            print(new_marks.pop())
        else:
            result = []
            if not x_found:
                result.append(x)
            if not y_found:
                result.append(y)
            print(len(result))
            print(' '.join(map(str, result)))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description and consider the required logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the four integers `n` (number of marks), `l` (length of the ruler), `x` (minimum jump distance for girls), and `y` (minimum jump distance for boys), followed by a list of integers representing the marks on the ruler.

2. **Existence Check**: The program sets up two Boolean flags, `x_found` and `y_found`, to check if we can already measure the jump distances `x` and `y` with the existing marks on the ruler.

3. **Finding Existing Measures**: The algorithm checks through the existing marks to determine:
   - If it can measure `x`, which can be achieved if there exists marks such that the distance between pairs of marks is `x`.
   - If it can measure `y` similarly.

4. **Adding New Marks Logic**:
   - If both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, it returns `0`, indicating no additional marks are needed.
   - If either `x` or `y` is not found, it attempts to add a mark that would enable measuring those distances.
   - Finally, if new marks are necessary, it returns the number of new marks added and their positions.

However, after reviewing the implementation, there are issues:

- The original logic is primarily checking if either `x` or `y` can be achieved through combinations of existing marks, but it does not ensure that both `x` and `y` are covered collectively before concluding if additional points are required.
- In certain cases with specific existing marks in the input, the logic may incorrectly deduce that both required distances can't be measured if it doesn't evaluate the necessary conditions comprehensively.

**Counterexample**:
1. Consider the input:
   ```
   3 100 60 80
   0 60 100
   ```
   Here, the existing marks allow us to measure `60` easily. However, for `80`, although `100 - 60 = 40`, we need to check that combinations of existing marks also lead to `80`, which should be 

2. The output should check combinations effectively, but due to the shallow checks in the program as noted above, it may incorrectly decide that new marks are necessary when they aren't.

Given this, the situation of not handling edge cases properly leads to incorrect conclusions being made during the program's execution.

**Correctness**: **False**. 

The program does not adequately cover all edge cases for when `x` and `y` are both not achievable, leading to a failure in correctly implementing the requirements from the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers (n, l, x, y) and a list of n integers (marks) from input, where the marks represent certain positions. It then determines whether there are positions in the marks list that are exactly x or y units away (in either direction) from any mark. If both x and y positions are found, it prints `0`. If only one or neither is found, it attempts to generate new marks by adding or subtracting x and y from existing marks, checking against the original marks list, and printing a randomly selected valid new mark if any are generated. If no valid new marks are created and neither x nor y was found, it prints the integers x and y, indicating that they were not found in proximity to any existing mark. The final output could consist of either `0`, a valid new mark, or the integers x and y in case of absence. Note that all edge cases are handled, including scenarios where marks could lead to duplicates or where no new marks can be generated at all.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
