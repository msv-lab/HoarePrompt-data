Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer in the range [2, 100000]; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged with `marks[j] - marks[i]` not equal to `y`, while `need_x` and `need_y` remain True.***
