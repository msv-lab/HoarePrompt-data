According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list and the `mark` variable. In the current state, `mark` is the first element of the `marks` list, and the condition `(mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set)` is true, meaning either `mark + x` or `mark - x` contains an element in `marks_set`.

At the end of the last iteration, we are currently on the first element of `marks`, and for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `mark` needs to be the second element of the `marks` list. Since `marks` must contain at least 1 element previously, it can be inferred that for the loop to execute again, there has to be at least 2 elements in `marks`.

Specifically, if `mark` is currently set to the first element, then after the iteration, it will move to the second element of the `marks` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; `mark` is the second element of `marks`; and the condition `(mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set)` is still true as it was for the first iteration.**
