According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, we are given that `i` is the next index after the current `i`, which means it should start at a valid position, and `j` will represent the current element in `additional_marks`. 

To ensure the loop executes, `additional_marks` must not be empty. Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state would be to emphasize that `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element, and `j` should be set to the first element in `additional_marks` (which would be the case at the start of the loop).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `i` is the next index after the current `i`, `marks` must contain at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` must contain at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`**.
