The code `new_marks.add(mark - y)` updates the set `new_marks` by adding the value of `mark - y`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and since `new_marks` is being modified directly, we note that it now includes the result of `mark - y` in addition to any existing elements.

Therefore, the new value for `new_marks` is updated to include `mark - y`. All other states remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`; `new_marks` includes the value `mark - y`.**
