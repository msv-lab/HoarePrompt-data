Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the marks on the ruler with `a[0]` being 0 and `a[n-1]` being `l`; `marks` is a set of integers from the input. If the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` is equal to `x`, then `need_x` remains True, `need_y` is False, `i` remains 0, and `j` is 2. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged as the else part does not alter any state.***
