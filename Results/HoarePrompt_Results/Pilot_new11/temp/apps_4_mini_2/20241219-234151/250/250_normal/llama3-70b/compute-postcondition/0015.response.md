Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the marks on the ruler with `a[0]` being 0 and `a[n-1]` being `l`; `marks` is a set of integers from the input; if the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_x` remains True, `need_y` is now False, `i` remains 0, and `j` is still 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
