The variable `additional_marks` is updated by appending `i + j` to it. The initial state indicates that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are positive integers and that `additional_marks` already contains at least `n + 2` elements. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified, but `i + j` will yield a specific integer that will affect `additional_marks`.

Hence, `additional_marks` now contains one more element: the sum of `i` and `j`. The states of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer satisfying 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer; `y` is a positive integer; `additional_marks` contains an element `i + j` appended to its previous state; `marks` remains unchanged.**
