To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided state and the for loop.

1. **Understanding the Variables and Loop**:  
   The loop `for j in range(i, n):` starts with `i` set to 0. Since `n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 100000), the range for `j` will be from `i` (which is 0) to `n-1`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, in our case, the loop can execute immediately because `i` is already 0, and assuming `n` is 2 or greater (which it must be, since `n >= 2`).

2. **Initial Values of Other Variables**:  
   The other states before the loop, including `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks`, `need_x`, and `need_y`, are not directly relevant to the execution of the for loop since they do not affect the loop's ability to iterate based on the condition of `j`.

3. **Final Consideration**:  
   Given that `i` is initialized to 0 and `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2, the loop will execute, starting with `j` equal to 0 during the first iteration.

Considering the analysis, the states do not require any adjustments since the loop can execute with the current state as it stands. 

Hence, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= l <= 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= x < y <= l, `a` is a list of n integers representing the marks on the ruler with `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is `l`, `marks` is a set of integers from the input, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is False, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
