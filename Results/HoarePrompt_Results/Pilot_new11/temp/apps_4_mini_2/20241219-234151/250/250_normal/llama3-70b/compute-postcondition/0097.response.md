According to the code, the for loop will iterate over the elements in `additional_marks`. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is another element in `additional_marks` to iterate over.

Given that `j` is the first element and that `additional_marks` contains at least one element, after the current iteration, `j` will advance to the next element in the list.

Thus, the conditions for the loop to execute once more are:
1. `i + j` must be less than or equal to `l`.
2. `i + j` should not already be present in `marks`.

If these conditions are met and there is a second element in `additional_marks`, the next element will be accessed. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again:
- We access the second element in `additional_marks`, which will be assigned to `j`.

State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, `y` are positive integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000 and 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `i` is less than `n`, `marks` contains at least `n` elements, `additional_marks` must contain at least 2 elements where `j` is the second element in `additional_marks`**
