Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the marks on the ruler with `a[0]` being 0 and `a[n-1]` being `l`, `marks` is a set of integers from the input, `need_x` remains True, `need_y` stays True, `i` remains 0, and `j` is still 1; if the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]` equals `x`, then the condition is satisfied while the values of `need_x`, `need_y`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
