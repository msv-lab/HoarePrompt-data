Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`, and `additional_marks` contains at least the integers `x`, `y`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` now also contains `i + j`.***
