According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list. Since `marks` contains at least `n` elements, we need to determine the current value of `i` and check if there is a next value for `i` in `marks` to see if the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next index after the current `i`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to reference another element in the `marks` list. Since `marks` has at least `n` elements, and `i` is positioned after the current index, we know that there are still elements left in `marks`.

Therefore, after the current iteration, `i` would move to the next value in `marks`, which can be obtained from its current position. That next index should be less than `n`, implying `i` can take values ranging up to `n-1`. 

Thus, we can state that `i` would be the next index after the current iteration, and since there are still elements in `marks`, the loop can execute again.

Assuming the current index of `i` before the next iteration of the loop is `i`, at the start of the next iteration, it shall increase by 1 since we move to the next element in `marks`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `i` is the next index in the marks list, must be less than `n` and must be 1 greater than the previous `i`; `marks` contains at least `n` elements; `additional_marks` is updated accordingly.**
