The value of `i + j` is appended to the list `additional_marks`, and since `additional_marks` must contain at least one more element, it can be inferred that previously the list had at least one existing element before the new value is added. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `l` <= 10^9; `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `x` < `y` <= `l`; `additional_marks` contains at least one more element, and `additional_marks` now includes the value `i + j`.**
