Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; `x_found` is True; `y_found` is True; `mark` is the first element of `marks` during the first iteration; the condition `(mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set)` is true; and the current value of `mark` satisfies either `mark + y in marks_set` or `mark - y in marks_set.**
