The value `new_marks` is modified by adding `mark + y` to it. This operation does not change the state of other variables, which remain intact. The variable `new_marks` will now contain the additional element `mark + y`. Other variables retain their values and conditions as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n` and the sequence is strictly increasing; `marks` is a non-empty list of integers; `marks_set` is a set containing the unique elements from `marks`; `x_found` is False, and `y_found` is False; and one of the following holds true for some `mark` in `marks_set`: `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set`, or `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` now contains `mark + y` in addition to its previous elements.**
