The `print` function outputs the values contained in `result` as a space-separated string. The `result` variable contains the values of `x` and `y`, which are both positive integers satisfying the condition 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`.

Since the content of `result` does not change as a result of the executed code, and it retains the inclusion of the values of `x` and `y`, the output state includes all valid preconditions still applicable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^9; `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `y` ≤ `l`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, with 0 < `a[i]` < `l` for 1 ≤ `i` < `n`; `marks` is a list of integers; `marks_set` is a set of unique elements from `marks`; `new_marks` is an empty list; `x_found` is False; `y_found` is False; `result` includes the value of `x` and the value of `y`.**
