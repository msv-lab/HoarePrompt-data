You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation step by step.

The program defines a function `func()` that reads inputs and aims to find additional marks that need to be added to the ruler to allow measurement of two specified distances (`x` and `y`). 

1. **Input Handling:** It reads the number of marks `n`, the length of the ruler `l`, and the required jump distances `x` and `y`, followed by the current marks.
2. **Distance Calculation:** A nested loop checks all pairs of the current marks to see if the difference between any two marks equals `x` or `y`, setting flags `need_x` and `need_y` accordingly.
3. **Determining Additional Marks:** If the corresponding flags (`need_x` or `need_y`) remain `False`, the distances `x` or `y` are appended to the list of `additional_marks`.
4. **Generating New Marks:** The program checks if any new marks can fulfill the needed distances by adding existing marks to each of the needed distances, ensuring that they do not exceed the ruler's length or duplicate existing marks.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the number of additional marks needed and their distances.

**Potential Edge Cases to Consider:**
- What if `x` or `y` are present in the initial marks but in such a way that they cannot be measured using the current marks? For example, if there were gaps in the marks that prohibit measuring the exact distance despite the values being present.
- The handling of cases where the additional marks overflow the ruler's limit.

**Test Cases for Validation:**
1. If we start with marks `0, 100, 200, 250` and `x = 185`, `y = 230`, the flags will be `need_x = True` and `need_y = True`, and the output should be `0`.
2. If we have marks `0, 20, 250` and need to measure `185` and `230`, it should recognize that neither can be measured with given marks.

After careful consideration, especially focusing on the process to generate `additional_marks`, the program fails to correctly handle the situation when it miscounts the necessary new marks needed due to failing to check if any newly computed marks aren’t already present. Therefore, an example where the program would not work correctly is when it doesn't accurately account for already present distances when generating additional marks.

With these considerations, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may not produce correct results in cases where the additional marks being suggested may already be present or exceed the maximum length of the ruler. For instance, if we needed marks at positions `x` and `y`, but both positions are already either covered by existing marks or calculated from pairs of marks that aren't counted in potential new marks due to an overlooking of existing distances.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
