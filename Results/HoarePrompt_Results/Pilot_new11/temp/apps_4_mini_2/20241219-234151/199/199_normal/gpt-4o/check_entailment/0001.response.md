To determine if the provided Python program correctly counts the ways to split the stick according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the function `func_1`.

The program implementation checks:

1. If `n` is less than 6, it returns 0 since it's impossible to split it into four positive lengths that would also satisfy the rectangle condition.
2. It iterates with `a` from 1 to `n // 4`. For each `a`, it sets `b` to `a` (first two lengths) and calculates the remaining length `rem`.
3. It checks if this `rem` can be divided by 2 and if its half is different from `a`.

The issue arises because the model does not account for all valid combinations that satisfy the rectangle condition without forming a square. By fixing `b` to `a`, it ignores scenarios where `b` could have values greater than `a`, which may lead to missing valid pairs.

Let's consider the edge case, `n = 8`. According to our understanding, the pairs could be:

- (1, 1, 3, 3): This works.
- (2, 2, 2, 2): This does NOT work because it creates a square.
- (1, 1, 2, 4): This does NOT work because it cannot form a rectangle.
- (1, 1, 1, 5): This does NOT work.
- (1, 2, 2, 3): This does NOT work because it cannot form a rectangle.
  
On manual checking, we find that only (1, 1, 3, 3) is valid. However, the function may not compute this correctly because itâ€™s limited in its logic for how it allows `b` to be set.

By further checking pairs for `n = 10`:
- (1, 1, 4, 4): Valid rectangle.
- (1, 2, 3, 4): Invalid rectangle.

But again, with the current logic of the code, it may miss the other pairs due to how it restricts `b`.

Hence, there are potential cases where the function does not correctly count valid rectangles, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to cover all potential configurations of `a` and `b` leading to incorrect outputs, which retains invalid pairs under the conditions of forming a rectangle without forming a square.
