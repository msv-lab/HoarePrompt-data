The variable `ways` is initialized to 0. The variable `n` remains a positive integer satisfying the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `ways` and the unchanged value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, `ways` is 0**.
