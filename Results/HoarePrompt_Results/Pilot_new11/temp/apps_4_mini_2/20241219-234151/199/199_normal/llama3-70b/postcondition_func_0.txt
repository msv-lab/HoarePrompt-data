The function accepts a positive integer `n` and counts the number of unique pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that `a + b = n / 2`, where `a` is not equal to `b`, `1 ≤ a < b`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ n // 2`. If `n` is less than 2, the count of pairs remains 0. The pairs `(a, b)` are distinct in the sense that the order does not matter (i.e., `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are considered the same). Notably, if `n` is odd or less than 2, the function will naturally return 0 since there can be no pairs satisfying the condition. Therefore, the function effectively performs a counting operation within defined constraints, resulting in a non-negative integer output.
