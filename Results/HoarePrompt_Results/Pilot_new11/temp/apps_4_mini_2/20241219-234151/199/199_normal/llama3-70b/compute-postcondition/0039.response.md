The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer satisfying the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9. The function returns the count of unique pairs (a, b) such that a + b = n / 2, with the conditions that a is not equal to b, 1 ≤ a < b, and 1 ≤ a ≤ n // 2. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the count of unique pairs (a, b) that sum to n / 2 while following the specified constraints, returning 0 if n is less than 2. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the count of unique pairs (a, b) such that a + b = n / 2, with specific constraints; returns 0 if n is less than 2.**
