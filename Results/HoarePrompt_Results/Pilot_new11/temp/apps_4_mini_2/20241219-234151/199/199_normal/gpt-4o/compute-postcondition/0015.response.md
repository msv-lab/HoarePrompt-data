The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` was 1, so the new value after execution will be 2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is 2; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is equal to `n - 8`, remaining greater than 0 and even.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is 2; `a` is 2; `b` is 2; `rem` is equal to `n - 8`, remaining greater than 0 and even.**
