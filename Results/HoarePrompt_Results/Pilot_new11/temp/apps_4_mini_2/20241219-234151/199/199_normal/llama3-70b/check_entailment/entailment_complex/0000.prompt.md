You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Pasha has a wooden stick of some positive integer length n. He wants to perform exactly three cuts to get four parts of the stick. Each part must have some positive integer length and the sum of these lengths will obviously be n. 

Pasha likes rectangles but hates squares, so he wonders, how many ways are there to split a stick into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

Your task is to help Pasha and count the number of such ways. Two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer x, such that the number of parts of length x in the first way differ from the number of parts of length x in the second way.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the length of Pasha's stick.


-----Output-----

The output should contain a single integer — the number of ways to split Pasha's stick into four parts of positive integer length so that it's possible to make a rectangle by connecting the ends of these parts, but is impossible to form a square. 


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
1

Input
20

Output
4



-----Note-----

There is only one way to divide the stick in the first sample {1, 1, 2, 2}.

Four ways to divide the stick in the second sample are {1, 1, 9, 9}, {2, 2, 8, 8}, {3, 3, 7, 7} and {4, 4, 6, 6}. Note that {5, 5, 5, 5} doesn't work.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9.
def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, `ways` is the count of unique pairs (a, b) such that `a + b = n / 2` and `a` is not equal to `b`, with `1 ≤ a < b` and `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 2`. If `n` is less than 2, `ways` remains 0, meaning no valid pairs exist.
    return ways
    #The program returns the count of unique pairs (a, b) such that a + b = n / 2, with the condition that a is not equal to b, 1 ≤ a < b, and 1 ≤ a ≤ n // 2, where ways remains 0 if n is less than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and counts the number of unique pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that `a + b = n / 2`, where `a` is not equal to `b`, `1 ≤ a < b`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ n // 2`. If `n` is less than 2, the count of pairs remains 0. The pairs `(a, b)` are distinct in the sense that the order does not matter (i.e., `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are considered the same). Notably, if `n` is odd or less than 2, the function will naturally return 0 since there can be no pairs satisfying the condition. Therefore, the function effectively performs a counting operation within defined constraints, resulting in a non-negative integer output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
