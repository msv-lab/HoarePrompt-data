Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 8, `a` is 3, `b` is a value such that `b` is at least 4 and at most `(n - 3) // 2`. If `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, then `ways` has increased by 1. If `a` equals `b` or `2 * (a + b)` does not equal `n`, the program does not alter the value of `ways`.***
