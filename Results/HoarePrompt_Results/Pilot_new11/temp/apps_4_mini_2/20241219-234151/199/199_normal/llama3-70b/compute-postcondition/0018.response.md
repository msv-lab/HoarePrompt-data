According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `b` in the range defined by `a` and `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. The current value of `a` is 2, and `n` is greater than 4, which implies that `n - a` is of interest. At the end of the last iteration, we need to determine the current value of `b`.

The loop starts at `a`, which is 2, and goes up to `(n - a) // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented. The next value for `b` will be `b + 1`.

So, if the current `b` in the end of the last iteration is `b`, then for the loop to be executed one more time, `b` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2` (the upper bound). The next value of `b` would be `b + 1`.

Thus, we adjust the state as follows: `b` becomes `b + 1` and we need the condition for `ways` to hold true based on the newly calculated potential pairs. Since `a` is fixed at 2 and the next calculated `b` must also comply with the conditions. 

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `ways` is the count of pairs (2, b) such that 2 * (2 + b) == n with `b` being the next possible value.**
