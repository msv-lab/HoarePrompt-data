The code snippet increments the variable `ways` by 1. The variable `ways` is not mentioned in the initial state, which means its previous value is unknown. However, all other variables retain their states. 

Therefore, the output state will include:
- `n` is at least 8,
- `a` is 3,
- `b` is at least 6 (incremented from 5) and at most `(n - 3) // 2`,
- `ways` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `a` is 3, `b` is at least 6 (incremented from 5) and at most `(n - 3) // 2`, `ways` is incremented by 1.**
