In reviewing the provided information, we can see that the original assessment argues that the program is faulty and thus concludes its correctness to be **False**. The assessment carefully examines the loops and conditions in the logic of `func_1(n)` and highlights specific scenarios where the code fails to yield the expected results as per the problem description.

The main assertion made by the original assessment is that the program does not account properly for all valid configurations and can produce incorrect results for various inputs. The logic of accumulating `ways` relies on correctly identifying pairs `(a, b)` that meet certain criteria; however, it asserts that it skips valid cases as listed (especially for lower values of `n`).

The annotated code explicitly states the conditions under which counts are made valid and defines the constraints of the output based on the iterations of `a` and `b`. Annotations also affirm that if `n` is less than 2, `ways` stays 0, which aligns with the conclusion in the assessment that for certain values the conditions may not yield a successful pair and provide the intended counts.

After thorough consideration of the annotations, which reinforce the original assessment, it is clear that the conditions specified in the problem description are not adequately fulfilled by the program's logic.

Given this alignment, the original assessment stands correct. To summarize:

Final: **False**
