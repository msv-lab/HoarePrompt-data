Functionality: **The function reads three integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` from input, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 10^9, `m` is between 2 and 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`. It then calculates a modified value of `k` (using `k % (n * 2 - 2)`) and determines which coordinates to print based on the value of `k`. Specifically, if `k` is less than `n - 1`, it outputs the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` falls within the range `[n - 1, n * 2 - 2)`, it computes and prints coordinates derived from the modified `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, it outputs the fixed coordinates `(1, 2)`. Therefore, the function effectively translates the input `k` into specific (1-indexed) grid coordinates based on the conditions outlined, handling edge cases appropriately but not performing any additional validation or safeguards against invalid inputs beyond those specified.**
