The value of `k` is decremented by `n - 1`. Since `k` is initially a non-negative integer and is constrained such that `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the resulting value of `k` will still be non-negative. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `k` becomes `k - (n - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even; `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`.**
