The variable `col` is assigned the value of `2 + remaining_steps`. The value of `remaining_steps` is determined by the calculation `k % (m - 1)` from the initial state, but since its specific value was not provided, we can only refer to it as `remaining_steps`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `k - (n - 1)` and less than `n·m`; `full_rows` is an even non-negative integer equal to `k // (m - 1)`; `remaining_steps` is equal to `k % (m - 1)`; `row` is equal to `n - full_rows`; `col` is equal to `2 + remaining_steps`.**
