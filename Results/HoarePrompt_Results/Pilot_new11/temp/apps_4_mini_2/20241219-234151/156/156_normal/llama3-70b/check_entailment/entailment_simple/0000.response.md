To determine whether the provided program is correct according to the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the `func` method.

### Problem Description Recap:
Lara moves in a particular pattern through a 2D grid based on the given `n` (rows), `m` (columns), and `k` (number of moves). The task is to calculate Lara's position after she has made `k` moves.

1. Starting point: (1, 1)
2. Moves down to: (n, 1)
3. Moves in a snake-like pattern across the grid.

### Expected Behavior:
The expected output requires us to determine Lara's position based on:
- If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then she is still moving down the first column.
- If `k` falls within certain ranges, specific calculations need to be performed to output her position based on the snake-like movement.

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured as follows:

1. **Input Handling:** 
   - It reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Modulation:** 
   - `k %= n * 2 - 2;` ensures that we rotate around the total cycle of moves Lara can perform, taking care of repeating cycles.

3. **If Statements:**
   - **First Condition:** For `k < n - 1`, it correctly returns her position as `(k + 1, 1)`. This aligns with moving down the first column.
   - **Second Condition:** When `k` falls between `n - 1` and `n * 2 - 2`, it calculates both the row and column based on the current position in the snake-like pattern through:
     - Row calculation: `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`
     - Column calculation: `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`
   - **Else Condition:** If `k >= n * 2 - 2`, it returns (1, 2), indicating the end of a full traversal.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately captures the expected behavior described in the problem. It accounts for all transitions and correctly computes the position based on the number of moves `k`. Each condition reflects the movement pattern specified in the problem.

Thus, the program correctly implements the rules and constraints given in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
