The code calls the `print` function to output the values of `k + 1` and `1`. The value of `k` is currently known to be less than `n - 1`, but the exact value of `k` is not specified. Thus, we can only say that the result of `k + 1` is strictly less than `n`.

Since no variables are changed by the `print` statement, the only output is the printed values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m and k is less than n - 1; printed values are k + 1 and 1.**
