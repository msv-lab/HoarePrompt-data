You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, consider the following test case:

**Input:**  
`4 3 9`  

According to the problem description, after 9 moves, Lara should be at cell (3, 1) based on the defined movement pattern. However, the program calculates her position as follows:

1. The `k` value after modulus operation will yield `9 % (4 * 2 - 2) = 9 % 6 = 3`.
2. The code then checks which range `k` falls into. Since `k (3)` is less than `n - 1 (3)`, it mistakenly calculates the position as:
   ```python
   print(k + 1, 1)  # This outputs (4, 1)
   ``` 
   This is incorrect, as it should output (3, 1).

This discrepancy demonstrates that the logic handling the snake-like movement is flawed, resulting in an incorrect output for at least this input case. Thus, the program is not correct as per the problem requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` from input, where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 10^9, `m` is between 2 and 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`. It then calculates a modified value of `k` (using `k % (n * 2 - 2)`) and determines which coordinates to print based on the value of `k`. Specifically, if `k` is less than `n - 1`, it outputs the coordinates `(k + 1, 1)`. If `k` falls within the range `[n - 1, n * 2 - 2)`, it computes and prints coordinates derived from the modified `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, it outputs the fixed coordinates `(1, 2)`. Therefore, the function effectively translates the input `k` into specific (1-indexed) grid coordinates based on the conditions outlined, handling edge cases appropriately but not performing any additional validation or safeguards against invalid inputs beyond those specified.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
