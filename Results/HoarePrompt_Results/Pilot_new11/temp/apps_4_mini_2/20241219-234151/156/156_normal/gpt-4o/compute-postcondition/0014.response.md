Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is always even. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the printed values are `k + 1` and `1`. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n·m`; the values printed for `row` and `col` are determined by the evenness of `full_rows`, with `row` as `n - full_rows` and `col` based on `remaining_steps`.***
