Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` contains at least one tuple (x, y), `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged, and `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. If `frame_size` is greater than `max(n, m)`, -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, retaining its original state, and the iteration will print the contents of each row of `pixels` accordingly.***
