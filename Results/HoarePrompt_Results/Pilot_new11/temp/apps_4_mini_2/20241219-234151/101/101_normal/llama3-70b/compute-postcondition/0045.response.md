The variable `pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `'+'`. Given that `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and that the previous value of `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, the state of `pixels[i][j]` has changed. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and the boundary definitions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, boundaries defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are unchanged, and `pixels[i][j]` is now '+'**.
