The annotated program is designed to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it adheres to the requirements, and therefore whether it is correct:

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the dimensions of the monitor (n and m) and the subsequent pixel grid. This part adheres to the description which specifies how the input should be formatted.

2. **Identifying White Pixels**:
   - The program correctly builds a list of coordinates for all white pixels ('w'). This is necessary for determining the bounding frame.

3. **Determining the Bounding Coordinates**:
   - The program computes `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` which represent the furthest extents of the white pixels. This is essential for identifying the smallest frame that can contain all white pixels.

4. **Calculating Frame Size**:
   - The size of the frame is calculated as `frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. This logic is correct because it defines the smallest square that can encompass the identified bounding box of white pixels.

5. **Frame Size Check**:
   - The program checks if `frame_size` exceeds either `n` or `m`, printing `-1` if it does. This condition ensures that the frame remains within the bounds of the monitor as required in the problem description.

6. **Constructing the Frame**:
   - The loops that follow modify the pixel grid by marking the edges of the calculated frame with '+' if they are currently black ('.'). Importantly, it leaves 'w' pixels unchanged.
   - The program only modifies the pixels at the edges of the determined frame using logical checks (`if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)`). This adheres to the requirement to only set a '+' on edges, while preserving the state of 'w' pixels.

7. **Output Formatting**:
   - Finally, the program outputs the modified pixel grid row by row. This is consistent with the requirement to display the result of the game simulation.

### Edge Case Handling
- The program does consider edge cases effectively:
  - If the entire grid is composed only of 'w' pixels, no '+' signs will be necessary, and the output will remain unchanged.
  - It handles cases where the white pixels are at the corners or edges correctly, and it respects the grid boundaries.
  - By checking the frame size before modification, it prevents any invalid outputs or constructs outside of monitor limits.

### Conclusion
Based on the above analysis:
- The program successfully implements the task defined in the problem description, correctly identifying the pixels for the frame and outputting a valid result based on the defined rules.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
