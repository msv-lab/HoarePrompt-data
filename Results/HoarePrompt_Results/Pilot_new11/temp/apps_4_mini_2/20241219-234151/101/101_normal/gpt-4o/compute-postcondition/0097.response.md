According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is the loop index iterating from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, meaning that `i` should be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

If we want to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` was at the end of the last iteration, it would be `n - 1`, so for the next iteration it must be `i = n` where `n` must be greater than `n - 1`. 

Since `i` cannot equal `n` for the loop to continue, `i` must be one less than `n`, so the next value of `i` would be equal to `n`. Thus, `n` must still allow further execution of the loop which means it must remain valid in terms of the loop's constraints.

State: **`n` must be at least `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` and `bottom` contain the minimum and maximum row indices, respectively, of 'w' characters encountered, if any; otherwise, both remain None. `left` and `right` contain the minimum and maximum column indices, respectively, of 'w' characters encountered, if any; otherwise, both remain out of bounds. `i` is equal to `n`.**
