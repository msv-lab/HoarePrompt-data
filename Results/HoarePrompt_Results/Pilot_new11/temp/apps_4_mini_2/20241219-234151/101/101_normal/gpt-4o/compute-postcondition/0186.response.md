Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a modified list of lists of characters. If `i` is equal to `top` or `bottom`, or if `j` is equal to `left` or `j` is equal to `right`, then all corresponding elements in `result` at those indices that were originally '.' are now updated to '+'. If conditions for `i` and `j` are not met, then the state of `result` remains unchanged.**
