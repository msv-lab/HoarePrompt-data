The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`, which is currently 0. Since the initial condition states that `j` is greater than `right` (which must be less than or equal to 0), and `left` is 0, there are no changes to `bottom`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `j` is currently 0; `top` is not None; `left` is 0; `right` is now 0; and `bottom` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `j` is currently 0; `top` is not None; `left` is 0; `right` is 0; `bottom` remains unchanged.**
