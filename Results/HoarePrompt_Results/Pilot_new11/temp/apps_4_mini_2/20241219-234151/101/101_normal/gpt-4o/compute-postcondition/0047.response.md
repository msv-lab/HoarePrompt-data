Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `j`, with `bottom` equal to `i`. If `top` is not None and `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`; otherwise, `bottom`, `left`, and `top` remain unchanged.***
