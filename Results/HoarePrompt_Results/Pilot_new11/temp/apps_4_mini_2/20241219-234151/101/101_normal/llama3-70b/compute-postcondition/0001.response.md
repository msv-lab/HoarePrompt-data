`pixels` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that takes `n` inputs and creates a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to the input, interpreted as a list of characters (from the string). Other variables remain unaffected, but `pixels` will contain `n` lists of characters, each list corresponding to an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `pixels` is a list of `n` lists of characters from input.**
