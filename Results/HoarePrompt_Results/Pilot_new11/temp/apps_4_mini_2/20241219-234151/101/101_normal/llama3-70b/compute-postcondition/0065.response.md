Output State: **`n` and `m` remain unchanged, `i` remains 1, `j` is equal to `m`, and for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `pixels[i][j]` will be either '+' (if `i` equals `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y` and was originally '.') or set to '.' (in all other cases where the pixel was not 'w'). Additionally, if any pixel is originally 'w', it remains unchanged at that position, while `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged.**
