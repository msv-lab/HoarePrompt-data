Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `j` is currently 0; `top` is not None; `left` is 0; if `j` is greater than `right`, then `bottom` remains unchanged; if `j` is not greater than `right`, the condition does not apply as there is no else part in the code.***
