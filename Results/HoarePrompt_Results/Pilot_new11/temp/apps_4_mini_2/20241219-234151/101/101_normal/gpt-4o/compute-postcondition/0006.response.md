The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `j` is currently 0, both `left` and `right` will be set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0.**
