The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is equal to `k + 1`, which means `left` now becomes `k + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is `k + 1`, `left` is `k + 1`, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i` and `bottom` is equal to `i` if `i` is greater than `bottom`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is `k + 1`, `left` is `k + 1`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i` and `bottom` is equal to `i` if `i` is greater than `bottom`.**
