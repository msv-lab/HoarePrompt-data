According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` compared to `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is currently 1:

- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2 (since i will be 2 after the increment).
- The state of the other variables, including `j` which is currently equal to `m`, and `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`, remain unchanged.

State: **`n` and `m` remain unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `m`, and `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged.**
