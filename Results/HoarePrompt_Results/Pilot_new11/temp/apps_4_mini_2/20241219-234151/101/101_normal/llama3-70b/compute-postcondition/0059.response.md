To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions and the values provided.

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `m`. 
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we've not been given specific values for `j`, but if we know the loop is set to execute again, that means `j` must be less than `m`. After each iteration of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1.
3. As a result, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value.
4. If the prior value of `j` was equal to `m - 1`, the next value would be `m`. If it was less than `m - 1`, the next value would simply be incremented by 1.

Given that `n` and `m` remain unchanged, we only update `j` to the next value based on the current state.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set:

- `j` to `j + 1` (where the current value of `j` is such that it is still less than `m`),

And we don't change the states of `n`, `m`, `i` or the value of `pixels[1][1]`.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 (where `j` is less than `m`)**
