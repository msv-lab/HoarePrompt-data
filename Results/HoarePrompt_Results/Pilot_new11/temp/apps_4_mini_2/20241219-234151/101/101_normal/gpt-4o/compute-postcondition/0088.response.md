The variable `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. Since no specific values for `i` and `top` are given, but the condition states that if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`, it indicates a relationship between these variables. The variables `n`, `m`, `screen`, and `j` remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `j` is equal to `m`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i.**
