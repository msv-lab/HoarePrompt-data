Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, and `result` is a modified list of lists of characters. If `i` equals `top` or `bottom`, or `j` equals `left`, or `j` equals `right`, then if `result[i][j]` is '.', it is assigned '+'; if `result[i][j]` is not '.', no changes are made to `result`.***
