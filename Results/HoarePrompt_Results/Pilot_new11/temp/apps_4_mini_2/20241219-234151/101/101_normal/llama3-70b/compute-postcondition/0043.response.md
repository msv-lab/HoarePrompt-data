According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0 because the `range(m)` function generates a sequence from 0 to `m-1`. Given that `j` is currently equal to `m`, it means that `j` is already at the boundary where the loop would stop before it starts. For the loop to execute, `j` should be set to 0, as it represents the starting index in the range.

State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` must be 0, boundaries defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are unchanged.**
