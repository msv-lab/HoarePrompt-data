Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, `top` is updated to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` and `right` are out of bounds, `i` is updated to `i_end + 1` where `i_end` < `n - 1`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. Otherwise, no changes occur, maintaining the initial values of all variables.***
