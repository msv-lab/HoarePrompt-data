The variable `result[i][j]` is updated from the character '.' to the character '+'. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `left`, `right`, and `result` remain unchanged, but the specific position `result[i][j]` now contains a '+' instead of a '.'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `m` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `result` is a list of lists of characters with `result[i][j]` now set to '+', `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, `i` is set to either `top` or `bottom`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and `j` is set to `left`.**
