Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings; if `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, and `left` are initialized to 0, 0, and 1 respectively, while `right` is set to 1. If `top` is not None, `bottom` remains unchanged, `left` remains 1, and `top` is updated to `i` (since `top = i`).**
