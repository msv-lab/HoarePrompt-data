The code updates the values of `max_x` and `max_y` based on the maximum values of the current `max_x` and `max_y` compared to `x` and `y`, which are derived from the third tuple in `white_pixels`. Here is a breakdown of the impact:

1. `max_x` is updated to be the greater of its previous value and `x`.
2. `max_y` is updated to be the greater of its previous value and `y`.
3. Other variables remain unchanged.

We do not have the specific previous values for `max_x` and `max_y`, but we know that they will either remain the same or be updated based on the values of `x` and `y` from the third tuple of `white_pixels`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must contain at least 3 tuples of (x, y); `min_x` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `x` from the third tuple; `min_y` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `y` from the third tuple; `max_x` is either its previous value or the value of `x`; `max_y` is either its previous value or the value of `y`; `x` is the first element of `white_pixels[2][0]`; `y` is the first element of `white_pixels[2][1]**
