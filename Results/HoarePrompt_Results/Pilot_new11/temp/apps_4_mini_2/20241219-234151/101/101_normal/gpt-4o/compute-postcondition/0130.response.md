Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least `n`, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `screen` is a list of strings, and `j` is equal to `k + 1`. If `screen[i][j]` is equal to 'w', then if `top` is None, `top` and `bottom` are set to `i`, while `left` and `right` are both set to `k + 1`. If `j` is greater than `right`, `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged, while `left` is set to `k + 1`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
