The code initializes `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to `None`. There are no calculations or changes to the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `screen`), which will retain their values, but the state of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` has changed.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, and `screen` is a list of strings, each string consisting of exactly m characters where each character is either '.' or 'w'; `top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None.**
