The statement `result[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to a specific position in the `result` 2D list (which is a list of lists) at the index `[i][j]`. The indices `i` and `j` are assumed to be valid based on the initial conditions provided. 

There are no changes to `n`, `m`, `screen`, or the other variables besides the content of the `result` list. We know that `j` is previously defined as equal to `left`, `top`, `bottom`, and the variables `frame_height` and `frame_width` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `result` is a list of lists of characters, where one element `result[i][j]` is now assigned the value `'+'`; `j` is equal to `left`, `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `left`, and `right` continue to satisfy their respective conditions.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers within 1 to 2000; `screen` is a list of strings; `result` is a list of lists of characters with `result[i][j]` equal to '+', `j` is equal to `left`, `top`, `bottom`, `frame_height`, `frame_width`, `left`, and `right` continue to satisfy their respective conditions.**
