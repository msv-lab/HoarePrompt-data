The code assigns values to `n` and `m` by mapping the input into integers. The initial state indicates that `n` and `m` are integers that are in the range [1, 2000], and there is also an implicit understanding that input will provide values in that range. After executing the line of code, the exact values of `n` and `m` will be determined by the user's input. 

Since the values of `n` and `m` might still satisfy the original ranges but now need to be defined, the output state reflects these updated variables based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000].**
