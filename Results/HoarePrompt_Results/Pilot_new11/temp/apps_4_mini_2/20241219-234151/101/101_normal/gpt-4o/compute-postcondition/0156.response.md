To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute properly, we need to analyze the loop structure and variables involved.

1. The loop uses `j` and iterates over the range from `left` to `right + 1`. 
2. For the loop to execute, the value of `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. If `left` is greater than `right`, then the range would be invalid, resulting in no iterations.
3. The value of `j` will start from `left` and increment up to `right`, meaning initially `j` should be equivalent to `left`.

Given the context, the existing states before the loop may not ensure that the loop executes properly if `left` is not less than or equal to `right`.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes:

- We need to ensure that `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- `j` should start at `left`.

Considering these points, hereâ€™s how the state should be formulated:

State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `m` is an integer within 1 to 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `result` is a list of lists of characters derived from `screen`, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `i` is `top`, `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `left`**
