The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the code inside the nearest enclosing loop and goes to the next iteration. In this case, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and no new variables are introduced or altered, except for the flow control of the loop where this line is placed. However, we do not have specific details about the loop, so no explicit change can be registered in the output.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000], `j` is 2, and `m` must be greater than 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
