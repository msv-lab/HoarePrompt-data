The code assigns the value of `'.'` to the `pixels[i][j]`, where `i` and `j` represent valid indices within the `pixels` array. It is also given that `pixels[i][j]` was not previously equal to `'w'`. Therefore, the state of `pixels[i][j]` changes from its previous value to `'.'`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple of (x, y), `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `pixels[i][j]` is now '.', and either `i` is not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` is not equal to `min_y`, `max_y`.**
