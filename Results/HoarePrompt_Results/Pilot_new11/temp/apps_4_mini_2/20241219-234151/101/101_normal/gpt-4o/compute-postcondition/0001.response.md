According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ n), the loop is set to execute for at least one iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute, we need to state that `i` will start at 0 and will increment with each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. The initial value of `i` must be 0 as well.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `i` is 0**
