Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` remain unchanged. If `i` is equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[1][1]` is '.', then `pixels[1][1]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[1][1]` is 'w', the loop continues without modifying the variables. If `pixels[1][1]` is anything else, `pixels[1][1]` is set to '.', while `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
