To evaluate the next iteration of the loop based on the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to analyze the current values of the variables and how they will change when the loop executes once more.

- The loop is set to iterate over `i`, which ranges from 0 to `n-1`. Currently, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` will increment by 1 on each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, meaning that `j` is still the same as the initial value, which is dependent on the value of `m`. Since `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], it was initialized properly, leading to the assumption that the loop condition allows for execution.

Since we haven't invested in any changes to `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, or other conditions affecting the boundaries or states of `pixels`, we can keep those unchanged for the upcoming execution as long as no conditions related to them have been processed.

Thus, before the next iteration of the loop:

- `i` should be incremented to 1.
- The variables `n` and `m` should remain the same.
- The states for the `pixels` array or any boundary definitions will stay as they are.

Therefore, to enable the loop to execute one more time, the updated state should reflect:

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `m`, and the boundaries defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged.**
