According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Given the state before the loop starts, `m` is already in the range [1, 2000], so it ensures that `j` will start at 0 in the first iteration and can iterate up to `m - 1`.

Therefore, the loop will execute correctly without any changes to `n`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, or `frame_size`, as they do not influence the execution of the loop directly. 

For clarity, the loop execution will start with `j` being 0, and the conditions are already satisfied for `frame_size` to be less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` must contain at least one tuple of (x, y), `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all tuples in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
