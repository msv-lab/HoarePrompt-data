The values of `min_x` and `min_y` are updated using the minimum function. Previously, `min_x` is `float('inf')`, and after evaluating `min(min_x, x)`, it becomes the smaller of `float('inf')` and the first element of `white_pixels`, which is `x`. Thus, `min_x` is assigned the value of `x`. Similarly, `min_y` is updated in the same way with the y-coordinate. Given that `min_y` is also `float('inf')`, it becomes the value of `y` after the assignment. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the valid output state after execution will reflect the updated `min_x` and `min_y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` must not be empty and should contain tuples of (x, y); `min_x` is equal to `x`, `min_y` is equal to `y`; `max_x` is float('-inf'), `max_y` is float('-inf'); `x` is the first element of `white_pixels`[0][0], `y` is the first element of `white_pixels`[0][1].**
