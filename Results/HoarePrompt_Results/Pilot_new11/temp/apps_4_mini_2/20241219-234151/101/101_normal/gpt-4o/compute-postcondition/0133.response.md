The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `j` is equal to `k + 2`, both `left` and `right` will take on the value of `k + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least `n`; `m` must be greater than `k + 2`; `screen` is a list of strings; `j` is equal to `k + 2`; `top` is equal to `bottom` which is equal to `i`; `left` is equal to `k + 2`, `right` is equal to `k + 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `n`; `m` must be greater than `k + 2`; `screen` is a list of strings; `j` is equal to `k + 2`; `top` is equal to `bottom` which is equal to `i`; `left` is equal to `k + 2`; `right` is equal to `k + 2**.
