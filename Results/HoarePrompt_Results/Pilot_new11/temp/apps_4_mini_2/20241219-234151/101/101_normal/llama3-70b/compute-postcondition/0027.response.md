Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000]. If `pixels[i][j]` is equal to 'w', then execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `pixels[i][j]` is equal to '.', then the program state remains such that `i` is still 0, `j` is still 0, and the conditions on `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged, with either `i` being not equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or `j` being not equal to `min_y`, `max_y`.***
