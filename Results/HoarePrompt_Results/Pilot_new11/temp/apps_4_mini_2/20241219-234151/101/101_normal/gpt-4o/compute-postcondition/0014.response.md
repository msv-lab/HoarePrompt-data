Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, there are no changes to `bottom`. The current value of `screen[i][j]` remains 'w', `j` is still 0, `top` is not None, and the current value of `j` is less than `left`.***
