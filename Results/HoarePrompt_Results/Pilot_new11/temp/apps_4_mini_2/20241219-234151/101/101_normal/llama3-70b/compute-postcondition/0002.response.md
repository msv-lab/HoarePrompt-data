The code creates a list called `white_pixels` that contains tuples of indices `(i, j)` for each position in the `pixels` list where the character is `'w'`. Since `n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], it represents the number of lists in `pixels`, and `m` is also an integer in the same range, representing the length of each list (the number of characters). The `pixels` variable is defined as a list of characters structured in `n` lists. The initial state of `n` and `m` remains valid, but `white_pixels` will contain a list of tuples with positions of white pixels.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000]; `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) for each (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'**.
