The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element in the `pixels` array at the position defined by indices `i` and `j`. Since the initial state specifies that `i` and `j` are both defined in relation to `m`, and `j` must be less than `m`, the code modifies the `pixels[i][j]` entry without affecting the values of `n`, m, min_x, min_y, max_x, and max_y.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` remain unchanged; `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.'**
