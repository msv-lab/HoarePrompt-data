According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Since `j` starts at a value equal to `m`, the first execution of the loop will not occur because `j` is equal to `m` and the loop will iterate from `0` to `m-1`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, `j` needs to be adjusted to start from `0`. Furthermore, `n` does not affect the execution of the loop in this context, and its value can remain unchanged.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `min_x` remains unchanged, `min_y` remains unchanged, `max_x` remains unchanged, `max_y` remains unchanged**.
