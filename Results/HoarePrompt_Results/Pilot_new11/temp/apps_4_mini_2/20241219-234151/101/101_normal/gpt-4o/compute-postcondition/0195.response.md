The statement `result[i][j] = '+'` assigns a value of `'+'` to the `j`th position of the `i`th list in `result`. Since `j` is defined as `left + 1`, it is critical that this assignment remains valid, meaning `j` must not exceed the bounds of the lists in `result`. 

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`) are unaffected by this assignment in terms of their values or other properties. Thus, the output state focuses specifically on the impact of this line.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `result` is modified by assigning '+' to result[i][j] where j = left + 1 and j <= right.**
