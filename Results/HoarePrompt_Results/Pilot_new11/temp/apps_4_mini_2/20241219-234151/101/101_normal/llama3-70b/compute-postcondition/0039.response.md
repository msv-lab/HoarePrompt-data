Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers in the range [1, 2000], with `m` greater than 2 and `j` equal to 2. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is '.', the state remains the same with `n` and `m` still within their specified ranges.***
