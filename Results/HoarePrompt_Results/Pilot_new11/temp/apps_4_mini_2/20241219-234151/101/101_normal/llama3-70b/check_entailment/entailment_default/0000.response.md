The provided program has a logical error in how it determines where to place the frame, particularly in the marking condition for the black pixels around the white pixels. 

Here's the reasoning broken down:

1. The program correctly identifies the bounding box defined by the white pixels 'w' using their coordinates `(min_x, min_y)` and `(max_x, max_y)`.
2. The size is calculated as `frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. This size is supposed to be compared with the dimensions of the grid to see if the bounding frame fits.
3. If `frame_size` is greater than the grid dimensions, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
4. However, when marking the frame with '+', the code incorrectly allows a '+' to be added even in cases where the corresponding position based on `min_x`, `indicating the edge being marked, has a white pixel ('w'). White pixels should not be overwritten with '+' signs, meaning there's improper handling of the frame around existing white pixels.
5. The program does not handle the edge cases where the white pixels are positioned adjacent to the grid edges properly. For example, if white pixels 'w' are in the first and last rows, the logic may incorrectly try to draw a '+' sign outside of the grid space.
6. The output hints also indicate potential edge scenarios which include the requirement that only 'w' pixels may appear on the frame, or that when all surrounding black pixels need to be marked, they might inadvertently miss marking correctly due to the checks in the loop.

Given these observations, I can conclude that the program does not cover all potential cases accurately according to the problem description, thus:

Correctness: **False**.
