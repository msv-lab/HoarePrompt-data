Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` and `bottom` are defined based on `i`, `left` and `right` are out of bounds, `i` is updated to `i_end + 1` where `i_end` < `n - 1`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `right` is equal to `j`, which is 0.**
