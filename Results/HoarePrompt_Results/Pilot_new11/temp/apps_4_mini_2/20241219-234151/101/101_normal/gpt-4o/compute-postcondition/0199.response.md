The statement `result[i][j] = '+'` assigns the character `'+'` to the position `i` and `j` of the `result` list. The initial state specifies that `j` is equal to `left`, which is not numerically defined here but implies it holds some index value at the moment the code is executed.

Given that:
- `n` is between 1 and 2000,
- `m` is between 1 and 2000,
- `screen` is a list of strings,
- `result` is a modified list of lists of characters,
- `j` is equal to `left` (where `left` would ideally represent a valid index based on `result`'s structure);

The value at `result[i][j]` is updated to the character `'+'`. The details regarding the specific values of `i` and `j` (or `left`) are unclear, leaving them undefined based on the presented information.

Thus, the result will update the specified location within the `result` list to hold the newly assigned '+' character.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 2000, `m` is between 1 and 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `result` is a modified list of lists of characters with `result[i][j]` updated to '+', `j` is equal to `left`.**
