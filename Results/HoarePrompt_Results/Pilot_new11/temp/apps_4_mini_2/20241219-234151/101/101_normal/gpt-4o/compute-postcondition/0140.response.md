The variable `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is previously defined as equal to `k + 2`, which means `right` will also equal `k + 2`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `j`, and `left`) retain their previous states unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `n`; `m` must be greater than `k + 2`; `screen` is a list of strings; `j` is equal to `k + 2`; `right` is equal to `k + 2`.**
