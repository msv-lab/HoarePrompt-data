Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to `i`, and `bottom` remains None with `left` and `right` out of bounds, while `i` is `i_end + 1` where `i_end` < `n - 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.***
