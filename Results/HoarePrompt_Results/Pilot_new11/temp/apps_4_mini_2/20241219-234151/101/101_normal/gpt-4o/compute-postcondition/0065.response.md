Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `screen` is a list of strings, `top` and `bottom` are defined based on `i`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `top` is updated to `i`, `bottom` is set to `i`, `left` and `right` are out of bounds, `i` is updated to `i_end + 1` where `i_end` < `n - 1`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the current value of `j` is greater than `right`. Otherwise, no changes occur, maintaining the initial values of all variables.***
