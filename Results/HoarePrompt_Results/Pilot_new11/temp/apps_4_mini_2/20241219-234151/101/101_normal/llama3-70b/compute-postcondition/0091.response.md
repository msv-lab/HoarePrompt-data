To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given conditions and context. The loop iterates through `pixels`, so the following states must be considered:

1. **`pixels` must be a list or array of `n` rows**: Since the loop iterates over `pixels` for `n` times, `pixels` should have at least `n` rows; otherwise, the loop would not execute.

2. **Each row in `pixels` must contain `m` columns**: The inner workings of the loop suggest that for each row processed, there should be `m` columns available to check and potentially modify the pixel values.

3. **Pixel values must adhere to the specified conditions**: At the start of the loop, all 'w' pixels remain unchanged, while the other pixels will be set to '.' unless specified to be '+' through conditions within the loop. Therefore, we must ensure that pixels are prepared for this functionality.

4. **Validity of pixel array during iteration**: We need to ensure that during the loop execution, the structure of `pixels` (the type and dimensions) allows for iterations, checking conditions, and modifications based on the tuple specifications provided by `white_pixels`.

Based on this analysis, the required states to ensure the loop executes properly would include the following:

State: **`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `m` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `white_pixels` is a list containing at least one tuple (x, y), `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` unchanged, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`**.
