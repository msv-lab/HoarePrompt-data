The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remainder of the code in its current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. This means no variables are updated in this particular snippet, but it does imply that the code continues iterating under the defined conditions. Therefore, the output state consists of the unchanged variables and the indication that we continue with the loop.

Output State: **`count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T`, and we continue in the loop.**
