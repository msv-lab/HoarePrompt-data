In the provided code snippet `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`, the variable `times` is being assigned the output from the function `func_2` called with the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Here, the variables `N`, `K`, and `ans` remain unchanged based on the information given. However, without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot ascertain the contents of `times` after the function call.

Since the output state must report only changes and keep valid information, we will state that `times` is now assigned whatever value or structure the function `func_2` returns (which we cannot determine).

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is assigned the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y); `ans` is updated to the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]; y` has reached 1000 and cannot be incremented further.**
