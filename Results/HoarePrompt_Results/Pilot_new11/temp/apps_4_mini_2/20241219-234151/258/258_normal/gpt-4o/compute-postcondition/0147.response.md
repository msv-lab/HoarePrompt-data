Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is the average x-coordinate from the last two tuples processed, `cy` is the average y-coordinate from the last two tuples processed, `dx` and `dy` represent half the differences of the respective coordinates from the last two tuples processed, `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples processed, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`), `i` is N where N is greater than `i + 1`, and the current value of `d` is less than 0.***
