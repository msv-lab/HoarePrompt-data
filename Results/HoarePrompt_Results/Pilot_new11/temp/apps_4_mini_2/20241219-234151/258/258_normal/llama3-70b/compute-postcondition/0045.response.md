The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It calculates a value based on the internal logic of the function. After executing the function body, it returns the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all coordinates `(x, y)` ranging from (-1000, -1000) to (1000, 1000). Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine and return the minimum `times` value corresponding to `K` from the calculated data within specified coordinate limits.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and returns the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` for the specified range of coordinates.**
