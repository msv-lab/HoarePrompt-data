Postcondition: ***`d` is equal to `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)`; `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`; `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`; `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`; `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`; `d2` is equal to `dx * dx + dy * dy`; `count` is the sum of the `c` values from `meats`; `N` is greater than `i + 2`; and `j` is set to `i + 2`; `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are assigned from `meats[i]`; `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned from `meats[j]`. If `d * d2 > d2`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
