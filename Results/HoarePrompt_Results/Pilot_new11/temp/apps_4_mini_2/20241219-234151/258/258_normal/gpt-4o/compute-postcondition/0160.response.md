Output State: **`d` is equal to (c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2), `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, `d2` is equal to (dx * dx + dy * dy), `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within threshold distance T from the final calculated point (mx, my), `i` is N where N is greater than i + 1, `mx` is equal to cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2, `my` is equal to cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2.**
