The variable `my` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Given the preconditions:

- `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)`
- `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`

The expression will utilize these defined variables to compute `my`. After executing the code, the other preconditions remain unchanged, as the operation primarily affects only the value of `my`.

Output State: **`count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)`, `mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
