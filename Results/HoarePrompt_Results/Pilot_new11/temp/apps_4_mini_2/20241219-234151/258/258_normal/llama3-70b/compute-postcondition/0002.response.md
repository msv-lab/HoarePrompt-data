According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from -1000 to 1000 for the variable `y`. This range includes 2001 values, so the loop can execute regardless of the values of `N`, `K`, `(x_i, y_i)`, `c_i`, and `ans`. Therefore, no specific adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop executes.

However, the initial state of `ans` being positive infinity is relevant for the computations within the loop itself, but it does not affect the loop's execution. Thus, the key points are that `y` will start at -1000 and increment up to 1000, covering all specified integer values within that range.

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, `ans` is positive infinity, `y` is -1000**
