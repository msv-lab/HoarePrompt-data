To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program logic and see if it handles all potential edge cases.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given `N` pieces of meat with their coordinates and hardness.
   - We need to determine the minimum time required such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready if a heat source is optimally placed.

2. **Program Breakdown**:
   - `func_1`: This function checks if a given time `T` is sufficient for at least `K` pieces of meat.
     - It iterates through pairs of meats, calculates the potential new heat source position using the midpoint and some geometrical calculations.
     - It counts how many pieces of meat can be cooked within that time `T`.
   - `func_2`: This function performs binary search on time values to find the minimal time `T` such that `func_1` returns `True`.
   - `func_3`: This function processes input and invokes the binary search to find and print the result.

3. **Identifying Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `N = 1` and `K = 1`, the program should correctly calculate the time required for that single piece of meat, which should be straightforward since there are no other pieces to compare against.
   - The output should also consider situations where the coordinates of the meat pieces are very close together, potentially affecting the calculation due to numerical precision.
   - The implementation appears to rely on the inner workings of calculating minimum time and checking coordinates, any missing edge cases like discussing constant meat hardness across various coordinates might lead to issues.

4. **Critical Analysis**:
   - The determination of the heat source's position and how it's adjusting the time using the pairwise approach could miss certain configurations of meat pieces where placing the heat source at one extreme yields a smaller time than at the midpoint between any two.
   - The binary search is done until a minimum precision (1e-07) is reached but we need to ensure that the feasibility checks in `func_1` are comprehensive enough to cover scenarios where hardiness or density of meat does not allow for additional pieces to be cooked within the constraints of time that are calculated.

After considering these aspects and the logic used, let's hypothesize a failing case:
- For a case with two pieces of meat at large distances with high hardness: 
  - If one meat is at (100, 0) with hardness 1 and another at (-100, 0) with hardness 1, the optimal temperature might miss counting due to precision issues or geometric miscalculation.

Because of the nature of these potential mistakes in geometric configuration checkups and lack of precise handling across edge cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
