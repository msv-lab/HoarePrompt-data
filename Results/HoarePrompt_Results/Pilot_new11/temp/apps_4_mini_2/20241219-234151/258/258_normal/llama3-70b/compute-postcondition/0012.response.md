The code snippet `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. Since sorting does not change the number of elements in the list or the properties of the other variables, only the order of the `times` list is affected. The other variables remain unchanged.

The output state reflects that `times` has been sorted, while all other initial conditions are still valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is sorted, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `y` is 1001, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat.**
