The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** due to several issues identified in the implementation of the program. Let's evaluate these points against the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input Variables**: 
   - The function `func_2` indeed takes coordinates of the meat (the first two arguments `x, y`) but uses them incorrectly by also passing the same `x, y` coordinates as `X, Y`, which are meant to represent the heating source's location. This is an incorrect approach since the time taken to grill each piece of meat must be determined based on the distance from the heat source, not from the meat's own coordinates.

2. **Heat Source Location Search**: 
   - The function `func_3` iterates over integer coordinates which may not necessarily yield the optimal solution. As described in the assessment, an exhaustive search over this range can be computationally expensive and may miss more optimal heat source locations, potentially yielding a non-optimal grilling time.

3. **Final Result Calculation**: 
   - The fact that the program sorts the times and takes the K-th smallest may indeed lead to incorrect results, especially since the logic assumes it's guaranteed that the K-th time is the minimum required to have K pieces of meat ready, which is not a properly derived conclusion from the problem statement.

The output hints provide further clarification on the function's behaviors but do not counter the assertions made in the original assessment. They reinforce that the function does not address the issues regarding true optimization and handling of input effectively. 

Thus, the reasoning in the original assessment holds true based on the identified logical missteps in the program. The output hints do not change the nature of the issues since they corroborate existing problems in implementation.

Considering all the evaluations made, I conclude that the program does not correctly implement the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

Final: **False**
