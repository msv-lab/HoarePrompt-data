Output State: **`d` is equal to `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` retain their previous states; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * (c1 * T - c2 * T) - (c1 * T - c2 * T) * (c1 * T - c2 * T)) / d2; count is assigned the sum of valid conditions from meats and count is less than K; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` must be greater than `i + 2. If `d` was less than 0, the loop continues, and if `c1 * T` was less than `c2 * T`, then the state changes would have occurred, otherwise the original values remain.**
