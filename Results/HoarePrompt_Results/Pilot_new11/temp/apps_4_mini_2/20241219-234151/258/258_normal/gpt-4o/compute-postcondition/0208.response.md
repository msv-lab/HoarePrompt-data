Output State: **`d` is the calculated difference based on the final pairs of tuples in `meats` processed; `cx` is the average x-coordinate from the last two tuples processed; `cy` is the average y-coordinate from the last two tuples processed; `dx` is half the difference of the x-coordinates from the last two tuples processed; `dy` is half the difference of the y-coordinates from the last two tuples processed; `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples processed; `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within the threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`); if the loop does not execute at all, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `count` remain undefined or retain their initial values, with `count` being 0.**
