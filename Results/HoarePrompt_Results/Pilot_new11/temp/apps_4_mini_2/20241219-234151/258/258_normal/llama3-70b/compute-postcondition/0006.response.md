According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `y` from -1000 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `y` must be -999, and the loop will check the condition for `y` to remain in the range. 

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `y` is -999, `times` is sorted.**
