Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect. The main issue lies within `func_3`, where the time calculations are based on integer coordinates `(x, y)` ranging from -1000 to 1000. This approach may not find the optimal placement of the heat source, which can be any real number in the two-dimensional plane. 

For instance, in the provided sample input:

```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The optimal heat source coordinates are at `(-0.2, 0)`, which is not an integer coordinate. The search space of integer coordinates means that the program may miss the optimal solution entirely since it can only evaluate locations that are integral and not real numbers. Thus, the correct minimal grilling time is not guaranteed to be found within the limited integer grid, leading to potentially incorrect conclusions about the minimum time required.

This lack of coverage for real number coordinates, along with how it derives values solely from integer placements, does not satisfy the requirement to minimize the time for grilling pieces of meat effectively for all potential cases.
