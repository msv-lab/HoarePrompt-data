The line of code assigns the value of `(x1 + x2) / 2` to `cx`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The output state should reflect that `cx` is now equal to the average of `x1` and `x2`. The preconditions for the other variables remain valid as mentioned.

Output State: **`count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is now equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`.**
