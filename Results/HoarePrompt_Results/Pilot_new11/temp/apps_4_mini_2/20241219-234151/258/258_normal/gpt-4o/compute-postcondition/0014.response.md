The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 2])`. The previous value of `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`, but it will be updated based on the new assignment. Since `index` is equal to `6`, the expression evaluates `data[8]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is now a list containing one tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 6, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[7])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[8])**
