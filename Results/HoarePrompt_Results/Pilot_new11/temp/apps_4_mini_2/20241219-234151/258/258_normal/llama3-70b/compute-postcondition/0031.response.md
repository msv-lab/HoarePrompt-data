`times` is assigned the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x` is 1001 and `y` is -1000. The values of `N`, `K`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this operation, but `times` now holds the returned value from the function with the current parameters. Since `times` is now defined, it will impact the computation of `ans`, as `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]`.

The output state updates are: `times` is now defined and holds the result of the function, and the original values for `N`, `K`, and `ans` remain valid.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is the result of `func_2(1001, -1000, 1001, -1000); `ans` is the minimum value of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]; x` is 1001; `y` is -1000.**
