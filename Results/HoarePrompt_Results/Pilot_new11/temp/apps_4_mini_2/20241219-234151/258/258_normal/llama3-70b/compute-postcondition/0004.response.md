The `times` variable is assigned a collection of values resulting from the `func_2(x, y, x, y)` function call. After this assignment, the `times.sort()` method is called, which sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The value of `N`, `K`, `(x_i, y_i)`, `c_i`, `ans`, and `y` remain unchanged, while `times` is updated to its sorted form. Without knowing the initial contents of `times`, we cannot specify the new values, only that they are now sorted.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, `ans` is positive infinity, `y` is -1000, `times` is sorted.**
