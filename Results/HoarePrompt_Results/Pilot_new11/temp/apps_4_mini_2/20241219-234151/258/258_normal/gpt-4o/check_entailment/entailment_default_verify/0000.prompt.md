You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program logic and see if it handles all potential edge cases.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given `N` pieces of meat with their coordinates and hardness.
   - We need to determine the minimum time required such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready if a heat source is optimally placed.

2. **Program Breakdown**:
   - `func_1`: This function checks if a given time `T` is sufficient for at least `K` pieces of meat.
     - It iterates through pairs of meats, calculates the potential new heat source position using the midpoint and some geometrical calculations.
     - It counts how many pieces of meat can be cooked within that time `T`.
   - `func_2`: This function performs binary search on time values to find the minimal time `T` such that `func_1` returns `True`.
   - `func_3`: This function processes input and invokes the binary search to find and print the result.

3. **Identifying Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `N = 1` and `K = 1`, the program should correctly calculate the time required for that single piece of meat, which should be straightforward since there are no other pieces to compare against.
   - The output should also consider situations where the coordinates of the meat pieces are very close together, potentially affecting the calculation due to numerical precision.
   - The implementation appears to rely on the inner workings of calculating minimum time and checking coordinates, any missing edge cases like discussing constant meat hardness across various coordinates might lead to issues.

4. **Critical Analysis**:
   - The determination of the heat source's position and how it's adjusting the time using the pairwise approach could miss certain configurations of meat pieces where placing the heat source at one extreme yields a smaller time than at the midpoint between any two.
   - The binary search is done until a minimum precision (1e-07) is reached but we need to ensure that the feasibility checks in `func_1` are comprehensive enough to cover scenarios where hardiness or density of meat does not allow for additional pieces to be cooked within the constraints of time that are calculated.

After considering these aspects and the logic used, let's hypothesize a failing case:
- For a case with two pieces of meat at large distances with high hardness: 
  - If one meat is at (100, 0) with hardness 1 and another at (-100, 0) with hardness 1, the optimal temperature might miss counting due to precision issues or geometric miscalculation.

Because of the nature of these potential mistakes in geometric configuration checkups and lack of precise handling across edge cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` reads input data to populate a list of meat pieces, where each piece is represented by its coordinates (x, y) and a hardness value (c). It expects the first two values from the input to indicate the number of pieces `N` and a selection limit `K`. After constructing the list of tuples `meats`, it calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `N`, `K`, and the `meats` list to obtain a result. This result, which is presumably a calculated value based on those inputs, is printed formatted to six decimal places. Note that the function assumes the input format does not contain any errors (i.e., it expects properly formatted integers) and does not handle edge cases such as invalid input or unexpected behavior if `N` or `K` do not conform to the specified constraints.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
