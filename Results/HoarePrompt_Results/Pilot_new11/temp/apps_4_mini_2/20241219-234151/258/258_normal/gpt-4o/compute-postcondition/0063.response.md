Postcondition: ***`d` is a negative value resulting from (c1 - c2) * T, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `cx` is equal to (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is equal to (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is equal to (x1 - x2) / 2, `dy` is equal to (y1 - y2) / 2, and `d2` is equal to ( (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 ) / 4. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
