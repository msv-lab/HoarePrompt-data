According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of x values from -1000 to 1000. Since this range is hardcoded into the loop construct, there are no variable states that need to be adjusted to ensure that the loop executes. 

However, it is important to note that while the loop itself will execute, the value of `ans` before the loop starts is set to positive infinity, which may affect the logic inside the loop. Regardless, to satisfy the requirements for executing the loop, there are no conditions related to the variables `N`, `K`, `(x_i, y_i)`, and `c_i` that influence the loop execution.

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `(x_i, y_i)` are integer coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000, `c_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 100 for the i-th piece of meat, `ans` is positive infinity**
