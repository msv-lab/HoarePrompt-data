The value of `cy` is assigned the average of `y1` and `y2`, where `y1` and `y2` are the inputs related to `cy`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State includes the new value of `cy` while the other variables retain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`count` is less than `K`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `d` is equal to `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
