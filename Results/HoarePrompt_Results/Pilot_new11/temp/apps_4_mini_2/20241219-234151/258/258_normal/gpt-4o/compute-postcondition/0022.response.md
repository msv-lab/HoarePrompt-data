The value of `index` is incremented by 3. Since the previous value of `index` was 10, the new value of `index` becomes 13. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be greater than or equal to 2; `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive); `meats` now contains the existing tuples and a new tuple `(x, y, c)`; `index` is 13; `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[12])`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 2; `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive); `meats` now contains the existing tuples and a new tuple `(x, y, c)`; `index` is 13; `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[12])`.**
