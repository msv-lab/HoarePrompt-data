The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 2])`, where `index` is 10. This means `c` is set to `int(data[12])`. The values of `N`, `K`, `meats`, `index`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be greater than or equal to 2; `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive); `meats` is now a list containing the existing tuples and the new tuple `(x, y, c)`; `index` is 10; `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[12])`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 2; `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive); `meats` is now a list containing the existing tuples and the new tuple `(x, y, c)`; `index` is 10; `x` is equal to `int(data[10])`; `y` is equal to `int(data[11])`; `c` is equal to `int(data[12])`.**
