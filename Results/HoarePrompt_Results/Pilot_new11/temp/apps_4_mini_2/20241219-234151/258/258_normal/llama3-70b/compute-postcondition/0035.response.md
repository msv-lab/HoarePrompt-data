Given the provided initial state and code snippet, let's analyze the impact:

1. The initial values of `N`, `K`, and `ans` are retained, and we now focus on the operation with `times`.
2. The function `func_2` is called with the current values of `x` and `y`, which are 1001 and -999 respectively. The output of this function will be assigned to `times`.
3. Since `times` is assigned the value returned by `func_2`, its specific content isn't known until the function execution is simulated.
4. The variable `ans` is then updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`. 

The key takeaway is the mention that `times` will change to the output of `func_2`, and consequently, `ans` will be updated based on the result of that function call.

So, notably, the initial parameters of `N`, `K`, and `ans` are preserved. The main modification occurs in how `times` and `ans` are updated.

Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is equal to the output of `func_2(1001, -999, 1001, -999)`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]`.**
