The function evaluates all integer coordinates `(x, y)` within the range of -1000 to 1000, calls another function `func_2` for each coordinate pair with the same point as both the start and end points, sorts the resulting list of times, and identifies the minimum time value corresponding to the `K`-th position in this sorted list across all evaluated coordinates. The function ultimately returns this minimum value. It does not take any parameters and its return value encapsulates the minimum of the times collected from all evaluated coordinates, specifically focusing on the `K-th` index of the sorted outputs. Edge cases could include scenarios where `K` is at its bounds (1 or N), but these are handled by the logic of selecting the `K - 1` index in a sorted list. However, if `func_2` does not behave as expected or does not return a sorted list of sufficient length, this could lead to unexpected results, although those scenarios are not explicitly addressed within the provided code.
