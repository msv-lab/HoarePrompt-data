The operation `x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]` assigns the values from the tuple or list `meats[i]` to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. The other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. The specific values that `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` take depend on the content of `meats` at index `i`. 

Output State: **`d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` retain their previous states; `my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2; count` is assigned the sum of valid conditions from `meats` and `count` is less than K; `j` is `i + 2`; `N` must be greater than `i + 2; x1`, `y1`, `c1` are assigned the values from `meats[i]`.**
