Output State: **`d` is the calculated difference based on the conditions of the meats, `cx` is the average x-coordinate from the last two tuples processed, `cy` is the average y-coordinate from the last two tuples processed, `dx` and `dy` represent half the differences of the respective coordinates from the last two tuples processed, `d2` is the squared distance between the last two tuples processed, `count` is the sum of `c` values from `meats` that are within the threshold distance `T` from the final calculated point (`mx`, `my`), and the loop iterated `N - i - 1` times. If the loop did not execute, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `count` retain their original values.**
