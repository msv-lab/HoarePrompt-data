The `index` variable is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` was 6, so the new value will be `6 + 3 = 9`. Other variables such as `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `K` must be between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is now a list containing the existing tuples and the new tuple `(x, y, c)`, `index` is 9, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[7])`, `c` is equal to `int(data[8])**
