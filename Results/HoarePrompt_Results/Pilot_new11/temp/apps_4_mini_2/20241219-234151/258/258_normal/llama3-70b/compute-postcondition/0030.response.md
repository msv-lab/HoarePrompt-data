According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `y`, which will take on values within the specified range from -1000 to 1000. The initial value of `y` is set at 1000 before the loop begins.

To allow the loop to execute, `y` needs to be modified to reflect its first value in the range, which is -1000. The other variables (`N`, `K`, `times`, and `ans`) do not directly affect the execution of this loop, as they are not involved in the range of `y`.

So, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 to 60; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`; `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(x, 1000, x, 1000); `ans` is the minimum value of the initial `ans` and `times[K - 1]; x` is 1001; `y` is -1000**
