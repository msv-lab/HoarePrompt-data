`cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but `cy` now holds the average of `y1` and `y2`. Thus, we maintain the precondition regarding the other variables.

Output State: **`d` is a negative value resulting from `(c1 - c2) * T`, `count` is less than `K`, `N` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
