To analyze the given code snippet step by step, we start from the initial state:

Initial State: `N` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is a list containing `N` tuples `(x, y, c)` extracted from `data`, `index` is `2 + (3 * N)`, `last x` is `int(data[3 * N + 2])`, `last y` is `int(data[3 * N + 3])`, `last c` is `int(data[3 * N + 4])`, `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(N, K, meats)`.

In the provided code, the only operation that alters state is the `print` statement, which formats `result` to six decimal places for display. The value of `result` is already computed and assigned before the print statement, so no changes are made to any variables upon execution of this specific line of code.

No variables have been modified by the code snippet, and since `result` is already assigned, it holds a specific value returned from `func_2`. 

Therefore, the output state remains effectively unchanged, representing that we have added the aspect of how `result` will be presented:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N` (inclusive), `meats` is a list containing `N` tuples `(x, y, c)` extracted from `data`, `index` is `2 + (3 * N)`, `last x` is `int(data[3 * N + 2])`, `last y` is `int(data[3 * N + 3])`, `last c` is `int(data[3 * N + 4])`, `result` is a value returned by `func_2(N, K, meats)` displayed as a float to six decimal places.**
