According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be equal to `i - 1` for the loop to continue executing. The next iteration will set `j` to `i`, which is outside the current valid range.

Since there is no else part in the code, the only condition that affects the next state is the value of `j`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time without needing any additional conditions, the current value of `j` needs to be incremented.

State: **`volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, `j` is equal to `i`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i` which means `j` in the next iteration will be `i`**.
