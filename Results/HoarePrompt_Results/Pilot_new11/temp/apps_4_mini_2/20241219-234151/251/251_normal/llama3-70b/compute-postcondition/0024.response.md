According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to increase by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. Additionally, for the loop to run a second time, `i` must also remain greater than `j`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is now set to 1, it meets this requirement.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration of the loop, the states need to reflect `j` being incremented by 1, and `i` remaining as is.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list containing `n` elements where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equals `cakes[1][0]`, and if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[0] + cakes[2][0]`; the remaining elements in the `dp` list are initialized to 0.0, and `j` is 1**
