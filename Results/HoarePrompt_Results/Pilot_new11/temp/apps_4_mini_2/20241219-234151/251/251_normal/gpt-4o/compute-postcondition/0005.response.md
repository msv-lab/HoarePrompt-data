The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cakes. The parameter `cakes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers: `r_i` (the radius of the i-th cake) and `h_i` (the height of the i-th cake). It is guaranteed that for all cakes, the radius and height satisfy the condition 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000.

Based on the output description, the function processes the list of cakes in some manner and then returns a value related to these cakes, though the exact nature of this output isn't specified. However, we can summarize what parameters are accepted and what the function does in relation to returning a value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` (a positive integer representing the number of cakes) and `cakes` (a list of tuples containing two integers for radius and height), but further details about its return value are not specified in the provided output.**
