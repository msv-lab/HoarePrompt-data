Postcondition: ***`dp` remains unchanged for all other indices. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `i`, and `dp[i]` is updated to be `max(dp[i], dp[i] + cakes[i][0])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
