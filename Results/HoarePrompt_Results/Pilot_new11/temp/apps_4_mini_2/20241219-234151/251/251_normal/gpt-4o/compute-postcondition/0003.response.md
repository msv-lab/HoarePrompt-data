In the code snippet provided, `result` is assigned the output of the function `func_1(n, cakes)`, which takes `n` and `cakes` as parameters. The value of `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and `cakes` is a list of tuples derived from `data`, specifically containing tuples of the form `(r_i, h_i)`.

Since we do not know the specific behavior of `func_1` or the values contained in `data`, we can state that `result` is now the output of the function.

The values of `n` and `cakes` remain the same, but we now have `result` reflecting the outcome of `func_1` applied to those values.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `cakes` is a list of tuples [(r_0, h_0), (r_1, h_1), (r_2, h_2), (r_3, h_3), (r_4, h_4)]; `result` has been assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, cakes)`.**
