`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the value of `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is initialized to 1, and `j` is 0, the precondition that `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]` and `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]` still holds. The specific value of `dp[i]` will depend on the comparison made based on `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]`. Thus, we can denote that `dp[i]` will be equal to `max(dp[i], dp[0] + cakes[i][0])`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `dp` is a list containing `n` elements with `dp[0]` equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equal to `cakes[1][0]`, and the remaining elements initialized to 0.0; `j` is 0; the current value of `dp[i]` is equal to `max(dp[i], dp[0] + cakes[i][0])`**.
