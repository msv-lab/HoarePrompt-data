According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is `i_prev + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment by 1. After the last iteration, `j` would be 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `j` is 2**
