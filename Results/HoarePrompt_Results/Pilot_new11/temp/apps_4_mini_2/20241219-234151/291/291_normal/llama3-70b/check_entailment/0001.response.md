To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the described problem. 

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of segments that Sofia has to draw using a ruler for drawing `n` unit squares. As per the examples given in the problem description, we can summarize the expected outputs:

- For `n = 1`, the expected output is `2`.
- For `n = 2`, the expected output is `3`.
- For `n = 4`, the expected output is `4`.

Let's delve into the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)
```

### Code function breakdown:
1. `n.bit_length()` calculates the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, effectively giving us the index of the highest bit that is set.
2. The expression `n.bit_length() - 1` gives the maximum power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
3. The calculation then multiplies this by 2 and adds 2.

### Assessing the logic behind the formula:
The formula used in the program seems to attempt to compute the number of segments that may need to be drawn based on the number of squares. However, let's analyze:
- For `n = 1`: 
  - Expected: 2; Calculation: `2 * (1.bit_length() - 1) + 2` -> `2 * (1 - 1) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2`.
- For `n = 2`:
  - Expected: 3; Calculation: `2 * (2.bit_length() - 1) + 2` -> `2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4` (Incorrect).
- For `n = 3`:
  - Expected: 4; Calculation: `2 * (3.bit_length() - 1) + 2` -> `2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.
- For `n = 4`:
  - Expected: 4; Calculation: `2 * (4.bit_length() - 1) + 2` -> `2 * (3 - 1) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6` (Incorrect).

The output for `n = 2` and `n = 4` does not match the required outputs: it outputs 4 and 6, where the expected outputs are 3 and 4.

### Conclusion:
Since we found that the program does not produce the correct results for all inputs (specifically for `n = 2` and `n = 4`), the program is **not** correct.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails for the input `n = 2` where it should output `3` but outputs `4`, and also fails for `n = 4` where it should output `4` but outputs `6`.
