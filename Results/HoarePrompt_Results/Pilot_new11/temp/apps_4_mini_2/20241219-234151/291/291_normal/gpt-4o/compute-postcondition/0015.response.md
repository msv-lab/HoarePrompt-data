The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it returns `min_segments_needed`, which is the minimum of all `segments_needed` computed during the loop for the positive integer `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the minimum number of segments needed based on the computations performed in the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the minimum of all segments_needed computed during the loop for n.**
