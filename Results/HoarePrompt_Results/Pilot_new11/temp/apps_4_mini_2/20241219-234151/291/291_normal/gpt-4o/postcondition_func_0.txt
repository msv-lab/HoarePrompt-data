The function accepts a positive integer `n` such that `1 <= n <= 10^9`, calculates the minimum number of segments needed for a rectangular representation of dimensions derived from factors of `n`, and returns this minimum value. Specifically, it iterates through potential factor pairs `(a, b)` where `a` is a divisor of `n`, computes the perimeter for each pair, and keeps track of the smallest perimeter observed. The returned value is `min_segments_needed`, representing the least number of segments required based on these calculations. The code correctly handles the range of `n`, but it assumes `n` is strictly positive and does not explicitly handle non-positive integers or other types for input, which may lead to unexpected behavior if such cases are encountered.
