You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the logic and consider potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Area Calculation**: It calculates the area required for the triangle using `area = n * m / k`.
3. **Integer Area Check**: The program checks if the area is an integer. If not, it prints "NO".
4. **Non-zero Area Check**: If the area is zero (which could theoretically happen depending on `n`, `m`, and `k`), it again prints "NO".
5. **Output of Points**:
   - When `2 * area <= n`, it prints points `(2 * area, 1)` and `(0, 1)`.
   - When `2 * area <= m`, it prints points `(1, 2 * area)` and `(1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it defaults to using `(n, m // 2)` and `(0, m // 2)`.

### Points of Interest
- The area is computed as `n * m / k`. It's crucial that this results in an integer. If any non-integer area is possible with the given constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k`, the program should print "NO".
- The program lacks checks on the validity of the points produced. The points should not only be valid integer coordinates but also must form a triangle that actually achieves the calculated area.

### Edge Cases
To check if the program is correct, I can think of potential edge cases:
1. **When `k` is equal to `nm`**: This leads to an area of 1 (if `k` divides without a remainder). The chosen points might not form a valid triangle or might extend beyond the bounds defined by `n` and `m`.
  
   Input:  
   ```
   1 1 1
   ```
   
   Expected Output:  
   ```
   NO
   ```

   The area being `1 * 1 / 1 = 1` is valid, but the program outputs “YES” and the points `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(1,0)` which do not form a valid triangle since all three points are collinear.

2. **When the area is a non-integer**: This is already covered in the program; however, the area being non-integer, or boundary cases where `n` or `m` is minimal could produce unexpected outputs.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not consistently meet the requirements laid out in the original problem description because there can be valid configurations where it outputs points that do not form a valid triangle:

Thus, in terms of the problem statement specifications and correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The specific failures identified indicate that there exist inputs that yield incorrect results per the problem's requirements regarding forming valid triangles with the specified area.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers within specified ranges. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then `'1 0'` is printed. Otherwise, since it is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is `'0 {m // 2}'`, indicating that `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, then the output `0 1` is printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then `'1 0'` is printed. Otherwise, since `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is `'0 {m // 2}'`, indicating that `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. If `area` is equal to 0, 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output `0 1` is printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then the output `1 0` is printed. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is `0 {m // 2}`, indicating that `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers between 1 and 10^9 and 2 and 10^9 respectively. If `area` is not an integer, then 'NO' has been printed. If `area` is equal to 0, 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output `0 1` is printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then the output `1 0` is printed. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is `0 {m // 2}`, indicating that `2 * area` is greater than `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from input, calculates the value of `area` as `(n * m) / k`, and checks specific conditions to determine the output. If `area` is not an integer or if it is zero, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by two pairs of integers that represent coordinates, which depend on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`. The potential outputs are coordinates that signify different positions based on these conditions. This function does not return any values; it solely prints the results based on the calculations and checks performed.
