Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing, the function ensures that the value of `b` is 0 and returns the value of `a`, which represents the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. It is important to note that if both parameters are initially 0, the function does not handle this edge case and will return 0, which is mathematically ambiguous since GCD(0, 0) is undefined.**
