You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Annotated Functions:
import math

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k:
    print('NO')
    exit()
(n1, m1, g) = func_3(n, m)
if abs(n1 * m) >= g:
    print('YES')
    print(0, 0)
    print(0, n1 * m // g)
    print(m1 * m // g, 0)
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'a' is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', 'b' is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the value of 'a', which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing, the function ensures that the value of `b` is 0 and returns the value of `a`, which represents the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. It is important to note that if both parameters are initially 0, the function does not handle this edge case and will return 0, which is mathematically ambiguous since GCD(0, 0) is undefined.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, with b >= 0.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns a tuple containing y and (x - a // b * y), where 'y' and 'x' are the results of func_2(b, a % b), and 'b' is an integer greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, where b is greater than or equal to 0. If b is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0). If b is greater than 0, it recursively calls itself with the parameters (b, a % b), and upon returning from that call, it returns a tuple consisting of the value of y (result from the recursive call) and a computed value based on a, b, and x (result from the recursive call). This function essentially computes and returns values that are related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds coefficients that express the greatest common divisor of a and b (along with that gcd). The program does not currently have handling for invalid input cases, such as non-integer values or negative values for a, which could be considered as potential edge cases.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns the values of x and y assigned from func_2(a, b), as well as the result of the calculation x * a + y * b, where a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_3` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, constrained to the range 1 to 10^9. It calls another function `func_2` with these parameters, which returns two values `x` and `y`. The function then returns a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` along with the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. The function's final output encapsulates both the results from `func_2` and a computed value that is dependent on the inputs `a` and `b`. There are no checks or exception handling for potential invalid states or ranges beyond the provided constraints in the comments, but the code assumes `func_2` will return valid outputs.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
