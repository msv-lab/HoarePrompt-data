The code prints the value of `2 * area` followed by `1`. The variable `area` is calculated as `n * m / k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are still valid and have not changed. After executing the print statement, `area` remains unchanged, and the program simply outputs the computed value alongside `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input between 1 and 10^9; `m` is an integer input between 1 and 10^9; `k` is an integer input between 2 and 10^9; `area` is equal to `n * m / k`; the output is a tuple with the first element being `2 * area` and the second element `1`.**
