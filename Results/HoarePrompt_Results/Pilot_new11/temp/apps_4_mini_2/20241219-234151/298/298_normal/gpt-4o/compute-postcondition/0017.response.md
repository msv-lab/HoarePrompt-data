The `print` statement outputs the string '1 0' and does not modify any variables. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged according to the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an input integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, `2 * area` is greater than `n`, `m` is greater than or equal to `2 * area`; printed '1 0'**
