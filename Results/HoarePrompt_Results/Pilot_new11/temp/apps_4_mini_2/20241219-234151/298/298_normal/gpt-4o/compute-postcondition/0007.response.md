The code prints 'NO', but does not change the values of any variables. The values of the other variables remain as previously defined, and the output is merely the result of the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an input integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k` (which remains an integer and is currently 0), and 'NO' has been printed.**
