The function `func_1` accepts parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers. After executing the function body, if `b` is 0, the function returns the value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `a` and `b`, and return `a` as the GCD when `b` is 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, returns the value of a, which is the GCD of a and b when b is 0.**
