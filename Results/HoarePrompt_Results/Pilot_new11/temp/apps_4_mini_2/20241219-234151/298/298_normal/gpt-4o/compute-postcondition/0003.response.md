The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` remain unchanged because the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the validity of the initial state is preserved.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an input integer between 2 and 10^9, `area` is equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not an integer, and 'NO' has been printed.**
