Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. If `area` is equal to 0, 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, the output `0 1` is printed. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m`, then the output `1 0` is printed. If `2 * area` is greater than both `n` and `m`, the output is `0 {m // 2}`, indicating that `2 * area` is greater than `m`.***
