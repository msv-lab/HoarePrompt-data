The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, where b is greater than or equal to 0. If b is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0). If b is greater than 0, it recursively calls itself with the parameters (b, a % b), and upon returning from that call, it returns a tuple consisting of the value of y (result from the recursive call) and a computed value based on a, b, and x (result from the recursive call). This function essentially computes and returns values that are related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds coefficients that express the greatest common divisor of a and b (along with that gcd). The program does not currently have handling for invalid input cases, such as non-integer values or negative values for a, which could be considered as potential edge cases.
