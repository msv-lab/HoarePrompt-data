The given Python code attempts to find three integer points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code step by step based on the problem description and the annotations provided.

1. **Input Conditions**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). The constraints state that \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^9 \). This part is adhered to in the code.

2. **Area Calculation**: The program checks if \( n \times m \) is divisible by \( k \) using the condition `if n * m % k:`. If this condition is true, it prints "NO" and exits. The area of the triangle must be exactly \( \frac{n \cdot m}{k} \), and if this is not an integer (i.e., when \( n \cdot m \) is not divisible by \( k \)), it is impossible to find such points.

3. **Functionality of `func_3`**: The program calls `func_3` which relies on `func_2` to calculate the GCD (greatest common divisor) and also returns a value based on the inputs. 

4. **Conditions for Printing Points**: Inside the `func_3`, there is a condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g:` which decides whether to print the points or not. The outputs depend on this condition evaluating to True and also on the calculations within `func_2`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The code does not seem to address the situation when \( k \) is larger than both \( n \) and \( m \). In this case, the area \( \frac{nm}{k} \) would always be less than or equal to \(\frac{nm}{2}\), which might lead to an invalid scenario for generating points.
  
- It's also possible that for some values of \( n \) and \( m \), while \( n \cdot m \) is divisible by \( k \), the conditions under which the triangle's area is correct might not be handled adequately with `abs(n1 * m) >= g`. 

- Even if \( n \cdot m \) is divisible by \( k \), if the resulting area does not allow for valid integer coordinates within the specified bounds, the program could incorrectly output “YES” and provide invalid points.

### Conclusion:
Considering the factors above, particularly the segment regarding potential values of \( k \) and conditions for generating integer points, the code does not cover all edge cases as stipulated in the problem description. Therefore, there exists at least one scenario where the requirements fail:

Correctness: **False**. 

For instance, if we take inputs \( n = 1, m = 1, k = 2 \), the \( \frac{n \times m}{k} = \frac{1 \times 1}{2} = 0.5 \) is impossible, and the program does not correctly handle such inputs since it checks only if \( n \times m \) is divisible by \( k \). It doesn't prevent impossible area conditions or provide valid integer coordinates for every scenario described in the problem statement.
