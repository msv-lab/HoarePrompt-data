Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1;` `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the position of 'G'; `T_pos` is the position of 'T'; `pos` is `G_pos + 2k`. If the character at `line[pos]` is '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
