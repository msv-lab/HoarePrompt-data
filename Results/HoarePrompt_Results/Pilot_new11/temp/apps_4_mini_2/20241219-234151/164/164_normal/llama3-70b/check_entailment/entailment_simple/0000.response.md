To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze the logic of the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program must determine whether a grasshopper, starting at position 'G', can jump to the position of an insect at 'T', given the constraints:
- The grasshopper can jump exactly `k` cells at a time.
- The path can contain obstacles represented by '#', which the grasshopper cannot land on.
- Positions are represented in a single string, with specific characters indicating the positions.

### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads two integers `n` (the number of cells) and `k` (the jump length), followed by a string representing the line of cells.
2. **Finding Positions**: The program locates the indices of 'G' (grasshopper) and 'T' (target insect) within the string. If either is not found, it prints 'NO'.
3. **Distance Check**: It then checks if the absolute difference between 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`.
4. **Obstacle Check**: It ensures that there are no obstacles in the way by checking all potential landing positions between 'G' and 'T'.
5. **Output**: Based on the checks, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Finding 'G' and 'T'**: The program correctly identifies the starting and target positions. It ensures that both characters exist in the string.
- **Distance and Jump Validity**: It correctly checks if the grasshopper can reach the target based on the distance being divisible by the jump length `k`.
- **Obstacle Verification**: The program accurately verifies that the path between `G` and `T` does not encounter any obstacles ('#'), which means it checks all cells that the grasshopper would land on during its jumps.

One key correction that must be made is in the calculation of indices within the string bounds. The formula `(g + i * k) % n` is not needed since the jumps can be made directly to `g + i * k` or `g - i * k`, provided the indices are within bounds. This is a consideration to ensure we're not mistakenly looping around when that behavior is not intended.

However, the "if" logic for checking all `g + i * k` is correctly bounded during the traversal from `G` to `T` by ensuring that the obstacles are checked along the way.

### Summary:
The program effectively translates the problem requirements into code logic:
- It appropriately gathers inputs.
- It verifies the ability for the grasshopper to reach the target based on conditions outlined.
- It correctly handles strings of cells, counting cells appropriately, and ensuring that only permissible moves are calculated.

Since the checks implemented follow logically from the problem statement and account for all possibilities described there (including the presence of obstacles and the constraints based on `k`), we conclude that this program is correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
