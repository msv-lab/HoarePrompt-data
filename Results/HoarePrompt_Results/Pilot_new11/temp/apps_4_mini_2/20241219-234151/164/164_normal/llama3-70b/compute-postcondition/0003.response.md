According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Given that `n` is already defined as satisfying `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, it ensures that there are multiple iterations in the loop. 

However, we also need to account for the initial state of `i`, which will start at `0`. The important points to note are:
1. The variable `i` will need to be initialized to the value of `0` before the loop starts, as that is the starting point of the loop's range.
2. The other provided variables (`k`, `s`, `g`, and `t`) do not impact the execution of the loop as these variables are not referenced within the loop structure.

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly from the start, `i` must be set to `0`.

State: **`n` is the first input integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is the second input integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is -1, `i` is 0**
