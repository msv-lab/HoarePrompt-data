The break statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement, so while the values of the variables do not change, the flow of control will be redirected accordingly. The variables `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, `pos`, and `reachable` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1;` `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the position of 'G'; `T_pos` is the position of 'T'; `pos` is `G_pos + 2k`; `reachable` is True; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
