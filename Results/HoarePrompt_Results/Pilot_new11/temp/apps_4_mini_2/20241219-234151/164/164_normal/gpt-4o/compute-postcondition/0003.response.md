The code `T_pos = line.index('T')` finds the index of the character 'T' in the string `line`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `line` is a string of length `n` that contains the character 'T'.
- `G_pos` is the index of the character 'G' in `line`, but its value does not change from this operation.

After executing the code, the variable `T_pos` is assigned the index of 'T' in `line`. Since `T` is guaranteed to be present in `line`, the position obtained will be a valid index where 'T' is located.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1; `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line'; `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`.**
