Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is a string of length `n`. `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` or -1 if 'G' is not present, and `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` or -1 if 'T' is not present. At this point, either 'G' is not present in `s` (g == -1) or 'T' is not present in `s` (t == -1).***
