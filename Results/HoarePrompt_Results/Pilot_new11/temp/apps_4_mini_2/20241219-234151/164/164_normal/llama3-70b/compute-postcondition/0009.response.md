Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is an input string, `g` is -1, `t` is either -1 or 0 depending on the condition, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T' if the condition `s[i] == 'T'` is true; otherwise, `t` remains -1 and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'G'.***
