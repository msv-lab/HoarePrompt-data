Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a potential issue where it only checks for the grasshopper's ability to jump from its starting position (G) to the target position (T) moving right. However, it does not consider cases where the grasshopper may have to jump left if T is to the left of G. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2
G.#.T
```
Here, the grasshopper starts at position 0, and the insect is at position 4. The grasshopper can jump 2 cells to the right to position 2 and then cannot reach the insect since there is an obstacle in position 1. The expected output would be "NO", but the program would return "YES" as it only checks moving right from G to T.

Thus, the program incorrectly assumes the direction of jumps and does not handle the scenario where T is to the left of G correctly.
