#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and the input string consists of exactly n characters, which include '.' (empty cell), '#' (obstacle), 'G' (grasshopper's starting position), and 'T' (target insect's position), with both 'G' and 'T' appearing exactly once.
def func():

    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `s` is a string of length `n`; `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` or -1 if 'G' is not present; `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` or -1 if 'T' is not present.

If the absolute difference `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k` and there are no '#' characters in the positions `s[(g + i * k) % n]` for `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, then "YES" has been printed; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in `s` (which can be -1) and `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in `s` (which can also be -1). If either 'G' or 'T' is not present in `s`, "NO" has been printed. Otherwise, if both characters are present, and the absolute difference `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k` with no '#' characters in the specified positions, then "YES" has been printed; otherwise, "NO" has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines if a grasshopper can reach a target insect based on their positions in a given string. It accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (length of the string) and an integer `k` (the hop distance). The string includes characters representing obstacles, the grasshopper's starting position ('G'), and the target position ('T'). The function outputs "YES" if the grasshopper can reach the target by hopping `k` spaces without encountering obstacles, and "NO" otherwise. If either 'G' or 'T' is missing from the string, it immediately outputs "NO". The function also handles cases where hopping wraps around the string, using modular arithmetic.
