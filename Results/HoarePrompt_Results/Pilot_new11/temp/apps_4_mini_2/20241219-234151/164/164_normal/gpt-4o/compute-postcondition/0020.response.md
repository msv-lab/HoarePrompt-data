The values of the variables do not change when the `break` statement is executed, but it indicates an exit from the most internal loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state retains the information about all variables but notes that we have exited the loop or conditional. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n - 1;` `line` is a string of length `n` containing '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'; `G_pos` is the position of 'G'; `T_pos` is the position of 'T'; `pos` is `G_pos + k`; `reachable` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
