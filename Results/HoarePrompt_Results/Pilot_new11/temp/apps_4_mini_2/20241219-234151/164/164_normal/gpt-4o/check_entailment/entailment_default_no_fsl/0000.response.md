Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address all cases outlined in the problem description. Specifically, for the case where the grasshopper ('G') can only access even indexed cells due to the jump size `k`, it fails to recognize that it may need to account for the parity of both 'G' and 'T'.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 2
.G..T.
```
In this configuration, 'G' is at index 1 and 'T' at index 4. With a jump size of `k=2`, the grasshopper can only jump to indices 1, 3, 5. It can jump to index 3 (which is empty), but cannot reach index 4 (where 'T' is located). The expected output for this input should be "NO," but according to the current logic, it would incorrectly conclude "YES".

Therefore, the program does not handle all scenarios correctly, particularly when considering the distance and the available cells the grasshopper can access based on its parity.
