Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input, followed by a string `line` that represents the cell states. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Identifying Positions**: It identifies the positions of the grasshopper ('G') and the target insect ('T') using `line.index()`. This follows the requirement that both characters appear exactly once in the string.

3. **Position Ordering**: The program checks if the starting position `G_pos` is greater than the target position `T_pos`. If so, it swaps them. This ensures that `G_pos` is always less than or equal to `T_pos`, simplifying the logic for checking reachable cells.

4. **Jump Logic**: The program then enters a loop that iterates from `G_pos` to `T_pos`, stepping by `k` each iteration. If it encounters an obstacle (`'#'`), it breaks the loop, which correctly implements the jumping mechanism described. If it reaches `T_pos`, it sets the `reachable` flag to `True`.

5. **Output**: Finally, based on the value of `reachable`, the program prints 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the insect and 'NO' otherwise. This output aligns with the required problem response.

Overall, the program correctly follows all requirements from the problem description and efficiently checks if the grasshopper can reach the insect based on the specified jumping mechanics. The conditions are handled appropriately, and it accounts for obstacles between the grasshopper and the target. Thus, it is correct as it meets all outlined criteria.
