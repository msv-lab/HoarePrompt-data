Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc; `new_pos` is calculated as (r + dr) * 2 + (c + dc); `new_state` reflects the swap between characters at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is the string created by joining `new_state`; if `new_state_str` was not previously visited, then `visited` includes `new_state_str` and `queue` now includes `new_state_str`.***
