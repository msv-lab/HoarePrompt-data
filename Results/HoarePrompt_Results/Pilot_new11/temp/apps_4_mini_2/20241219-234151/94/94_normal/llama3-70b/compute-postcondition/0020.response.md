The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists representing 2x2 grids that contain exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. After executing the function body, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the sorted elements of `puzzle1` are equal to the sorted elements of `puzzle2`, considering that `puzzle1` may contain swapped elements of `puzzle2` at specified indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two 2D lists, puzzle1 and puzzle2, and returns a boolean indicating whether the sorted elements of puzzle1 are equal to the sorted elements of puzzle2, accounting for possible swaps of elements.**
