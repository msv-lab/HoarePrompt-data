You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Functions with output description for each function:
from collections import deque

bessie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
elsie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
bessie_start = func_1(bessie_puzzle)
elsie_start = func_1(elsie_puzzle)
bessie_reachable = func_2(bessie_start)
elsie_reachable = func_2(elsie_start)
if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a parameter `puzzle`, which is a list containing exactly two strings. It concatenates the first and second strings in the 'puzzle' list and returns the result. The expected format of the strings is that they each consist of exactly two characters, and although the initial annotations suggest that the strings are composed of three characters ('A', 'B', 'C') and one character 'X', this is not enforced by the code. The function does not perform any input validation or checks for the length or content of the strings, meaning it will return the concatenation irrespective of whether the strings meet the stated criteria. This may lead to edge cases where unexpected strings could be processed. Thus, the final output is simply the concatenated value of the two strings, regardless of their content.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a string parameter `start`, representing the initial configuration of a sliding puzzle on a 2 × 2 grid, containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'. It performs a breadth-first search to explore all unique states that can be reached by swapping the position of 'X' with its adjacent characters (up, down, left, right). It maintains a set called `visited` to track all unique configurations encountered during this exploration. The function ultimately returns the `visited` set, which includes all valid unique states formed by these swaps. If no valid swaps are possible, the `visited` set will only contain the original state `start`. The function does not account for scenarios where the input string is not valid or does not meet the length requirement.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
