The variable `current` will be converted into a list and assigned to `new_state`. The value of `current` is `start`, which is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'. Therefore, `new_state` will be a list containing the individual characters of `start`.

Other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `queue` is empty; `visited` contains the value of `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is between 0 and 1 inclusive; `new_col` is between 0 and 1 inclusive; `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list of characters in `start`.**
