Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'. If `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, then `visited` includes `new_state_str`, and `queue` now includes `new_state_str` and remains non-empty. `current` is a specific string representation of a state, `empty_pos` corresponds to `new_pos`, and `new_state` is the list representation of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.***
