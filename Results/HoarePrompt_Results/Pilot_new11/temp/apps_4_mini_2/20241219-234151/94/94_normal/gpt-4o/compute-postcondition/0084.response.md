The variable `new_pos` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `new_row * 2 + new_col`. The values of `new_row` and `new_col` are given to satisfy the conditions 0 <= `new_row` < 2 and 0 <= `new_col` < 2, indicating they can be 0 or 1. Thus, `new_pos` will range between 0 and 3.

The states of the other variables remain the same, as only `new_pos` is affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` must not be empty; `current` is the last state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; `new_pos` is equal to `new_row * 2 + new_col`.**
