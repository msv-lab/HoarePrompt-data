Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; and `new_col` is c + dc. If `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds [0, 2), the characters at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped to form `new_state`, creating `new_state_str`. If `new_state_str` was not previously visited, it is added to `visited`, and `new_state_str` is enqueued; otherwise, there are no changes resulting from the execution of the if statement.***
