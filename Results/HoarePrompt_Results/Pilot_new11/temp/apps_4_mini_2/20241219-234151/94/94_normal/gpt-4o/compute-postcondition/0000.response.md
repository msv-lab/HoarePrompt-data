The `queue` variable is assigned a new deque (double-ended queue) containing the initial state `start`. The previous state of the `start` variable remains unchanged, while `queue` now holds a deque object with the initial configuration of the sliding puzzle.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from the set {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing the value of `start`.**
