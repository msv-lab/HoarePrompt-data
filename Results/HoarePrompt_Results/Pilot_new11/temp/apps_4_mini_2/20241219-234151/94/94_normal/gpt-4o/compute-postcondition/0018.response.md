Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'. If `new_row` and `new_col` are within bounds (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2), and if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state`, `current`, and `visited` are updated with `new_state_str` added to `visited`, and `new_state_str` is added to `queue`. If `new_row` and `new_col` are out of bounds, then there are no changes to `current`, `visited`, or `queue`.***
