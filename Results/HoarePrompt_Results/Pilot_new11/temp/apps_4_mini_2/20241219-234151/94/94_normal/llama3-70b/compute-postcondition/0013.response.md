The variable `x1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 4. The states of the other variables, `puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, and `i`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 4; `x1` is 4.

Output State: **`puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2D lists containing one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'; `i` is 4; `x1` is 4.**
