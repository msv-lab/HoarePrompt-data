The value of `new_state` is converted to a string and joined together to form `new_state_str`. The `new_state` is determined by performing a swap between characters at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`, but the exact content of `new_state` and `new_state_str` relies on the values of `current`, `empty_pos`, and `new_pos`, which are not specified here.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `new_state_str` has been created from the modified state. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `directions` has at least one remaining direction to process; `current` is the state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current'; `empty_row` is r; `empty_col` is c; `new_row` is r + dr; `new_col` is c + dc; `new_pos` is calculated as (r + dr) * 2 + (c + dc); `new_state` reflects the swap between characters at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; `new_state_str` is the string created by joining `new_state`.**
