Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` contains all unique states formed by valid swaps of 'X' with its adjacent characters; `queue` must not be empty; `current` is the last state removed from the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is equal to `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is equal to `empty_col + dc`; directions must contain at least 1 element; the values of `new_row` and `new_col` are such that they satisfy the condition: 0 <= `new_row` < 2 and 0 <= `new_col` < 2.***
