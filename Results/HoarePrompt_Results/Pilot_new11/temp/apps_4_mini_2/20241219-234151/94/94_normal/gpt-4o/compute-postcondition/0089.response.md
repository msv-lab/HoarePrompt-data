The `visited` set is updated to include `new_state_str`, which is the string formed by joining the elements of `new_state`. Since `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, it is added to the set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing three characters from {'A', 'B', 'C'} and one character 'X'; `visited` now includes `new_state_str`; `queue` is not empty; `current` is a specific string representation of a state; `empty_pos` corresponds to `new_pos`; `new_state` is the list representation of `current` with swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`; the current value of `new_state_str` is in `visited`.**
