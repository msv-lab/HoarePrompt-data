Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` which is a positive integer; `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`; `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, the current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
