The variable `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`, which was previously determined by the calculations of `new_a`, `new_b`, and the function `func_2`. The conditions indicate that `current_lcm` was either less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm`, and the value of `candidate` was also less than `min_k`, but `min_k` remains unchanged as it is not directly assigned or modified in this statement.

The other variables retain their values, so the output state reflects the updated value of `min_lcm` but does not alter the others.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`, `k` is greater than int(math.sqrt(diff)), `diff` is the positive integer calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; the current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`.**
