According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the range calculated with `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. The loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to the integer value of the square root of `diff`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. If we denote the current value of `k` at the end of the last iteration as `k`, then for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` will be `k + 1`. The loop should continue if `k + 1` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

Thus, we must ensure that `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is at least `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers with `a` not equal to `b`, `diff` is such that `int(math.sqrt(diff))` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, and `k` is the next candidate for the loop.**
