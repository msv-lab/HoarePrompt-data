The value of `new_a` is calculated using the formula `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The variables `a`, `candidate` are already defined: `a` is a positive integer and `candidate` is calculated as `diff // k`, where `diff` is greater than 0 and `k` is also a positive integer. 

The output state updates only the value of `new_a`, while the other conditions relate to the previous definitions of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, and `current_lcm`, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b`**.
