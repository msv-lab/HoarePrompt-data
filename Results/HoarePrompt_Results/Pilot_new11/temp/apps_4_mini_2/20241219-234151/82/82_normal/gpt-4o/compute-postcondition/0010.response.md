The code assigns `new_b` the value calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. 

1. The expression `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate` finds how many whole multiples of `candidate` fit into the value `b`. This effectively rounds up `b` to the next highest multiple of `candidate`.
2. Multiplying the result by `candidate` gives the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

The values of `a`, `diff`, and `new_a` remain unchanged by this operation. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `new_b` is now defined based on the value of `b` and `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 10^9; `b` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 10^9; `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)` which is a positive integer; `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.**
