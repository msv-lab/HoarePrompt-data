Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`. `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`. `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found among the generated candidates from the divisors of `diff`, and `min_k` is the candidate that produced this minimum least common multiple. If no valid candidates were found, `min_lcm` remains positive infinity and `min_k` is 0.**
