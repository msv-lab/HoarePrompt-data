The code snippet executes a function `func_2` with arguments `new_a` and `new_b`. The values of these variables depend on the calculations made before invoking the function.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
- `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
- `candidate` is calculated as `diff // k`, which is not directly related to the values of `a` or `b`.
- `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

After executing `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`, we are assuming the function modifies or computes the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. However, without specific values for `new_a`, `new_b`, or the `func_2` implementation, we can only state that `current_lcm` is now defined.

The variables' values remain unchanged except for `current_lcm`, which is now assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b`.**
