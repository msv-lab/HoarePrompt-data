Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `diff % k == 0`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found for the candidates generated in the loop with respect to the divisors of `diff`, specifically `k` and `diff // k`, while `min_k` is the candidate that produces this minimum least common multiple. If `diff % k != 0`, there is no change in `min_lcm` and `min_k`.***
