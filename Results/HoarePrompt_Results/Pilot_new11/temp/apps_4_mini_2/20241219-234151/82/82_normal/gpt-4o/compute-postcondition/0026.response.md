After executing the given code snippet, the variable `current_lcm` is updated to the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` without impacting the other variables directly, as they remain in their previous state. Since `current_lcm` is recalculated based on `new_a` and `new_b`, the updated state reflects that change. 

The specific values or relationships of `a`, `b`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, and `new_b` are preserved as described. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `current_lcm` is updated to the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
