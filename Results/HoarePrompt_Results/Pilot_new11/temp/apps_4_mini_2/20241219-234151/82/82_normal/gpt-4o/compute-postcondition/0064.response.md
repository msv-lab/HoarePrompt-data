The variable `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The initial conditions specified in the state do not affect the assignment, and all other variables remain unchanged. As a result, the output state reflects this update.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is greater than 0, `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, the current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
