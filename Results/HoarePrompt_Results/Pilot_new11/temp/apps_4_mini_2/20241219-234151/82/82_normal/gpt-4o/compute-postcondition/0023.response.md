According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. The loop will execute for each element in this list. At the end of the last iteration, we donâ€™t have specific information about the current value of `candidate` or the number of elements in the list, but we know that the list contains exactly 2 elements, `k` and `diff // k`.

Since `candidate` takes on the values from this list, the next iteration will assign `candidate` to the next element. After the first iteration, `candidate` would have taken the value `k`, so for the loop to execute another time, `candidate` must now take the value `diff // k`.

Thus, after the second iteration, there will be no more values to iterate over, so the loop can't execute again unless there is some modification to the list.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate` where candidate is `diff // k`**
