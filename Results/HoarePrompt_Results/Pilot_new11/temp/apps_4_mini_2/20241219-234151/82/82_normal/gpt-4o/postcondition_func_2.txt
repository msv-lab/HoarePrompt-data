The function `func_3` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). If `a` is equal to `b`, the function returns `0`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`, and identifies candidates from the divisors of `diff`. It computes the least common multiple (LCM) of modified versions of `a` and `b` based on these candidates. The function returns `min_k`, which represents the candidate divisor that resulted in the minimum LCM among all evaluated candidates. If no valid candidates were found, `min_k` remains `0` (the initial value), as the logic does not explicitly handle scenarios where no valid candidates yield a defined LCM. Thus, the function efficiently finds a divisor that minimizes the LCM of the adjusted values of `a` and `b` based on their difference.
