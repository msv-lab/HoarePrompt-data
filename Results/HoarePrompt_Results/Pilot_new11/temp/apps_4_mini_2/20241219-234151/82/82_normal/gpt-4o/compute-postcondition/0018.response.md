The code assigns a new value to `new_b` based on the current value of `b` and `candidate`. The formula for `new_b` involves using integer division and adjusting `b` with `candidate`. Both `a` and `b` are constrained to be positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The value of `candidate` is derived from an expression involving `diff` and `k`, thus it is expected to be a positive integer as well.

Given the constraints on `a`, `b`, and the calculation of `new_b`, the output will consist of these variables' values, specifically noting `new_b` as a function of `b` and `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
