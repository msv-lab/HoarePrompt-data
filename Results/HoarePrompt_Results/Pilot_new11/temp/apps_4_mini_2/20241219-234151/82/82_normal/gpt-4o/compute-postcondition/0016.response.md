According to the code, the for loop iterates through the list of candidates created from `k` and `diff // k`. Since the loop iterates through these two values, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to identify the current candidate value and the next candidate value.

Given that we have iterated through the candidates list already, we can infer:
- If the current candidate is `k`, the next candidate will be `diff // k`.
- If the current candidate is `diff // k` (the last candidate), there will be no next iteration since the loop will terminate after this iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `current_lcm` may have been updated, but `min_lcm` and `min_k` were only updated if certain conditions were met. 
- The candidates have already been iterated once.

Thus, to prepare for the next iteration:
- If the candidate is currently `k`, the next state should reflect that the candidate is now `diff // k`.
- Otherwise, we have exhausted the list of candidates.

Considering that candidates are derived from two values `[k, diff // k]`, and if there is still one more candidate to process, then it will be `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` and `min_k` is updated accordingly, candidate is `diff // k`**
