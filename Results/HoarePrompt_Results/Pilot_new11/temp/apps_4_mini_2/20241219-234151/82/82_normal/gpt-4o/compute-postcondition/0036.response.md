The code snippet calls the function `func_2` with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are derived from the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, we need to express `current_lcm` in terms of its calculation from the current values of `new_a` and `new_b`. 

Let's denote:
- `new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`

Thus, `current_lcm` is assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The information regarding `a`, `b`, `k`, and `diff` remains unaffected since they are not modified by the function call. 

The output state will reflect that `current_lcm` now holds the result of the function `func_2` invoked with the calculated values of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`, `k` is greater than int(math.sqrt(diff)), `diff` is the positive integer calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `new_a` is calculated as (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, `new_b` is calculated as (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; `current_lcm` is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b).**
