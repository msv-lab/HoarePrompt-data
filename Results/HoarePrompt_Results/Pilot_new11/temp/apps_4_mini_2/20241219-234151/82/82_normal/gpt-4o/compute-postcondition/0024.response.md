The variable `new_a` is assigned the value of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Since `a` is a positive integer and `candidate` is an integer derived from the earlier calculations involving `diff // k`, `new_a` will be calculated based on these values. This does not affect the other variables in the states that are unchanged. 

The previous values remain intact except for `new_a`, which is recalculated based on the provided formula. Since no specific values had been given for `a`, `candidate`, or `k`, we maintain them as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
