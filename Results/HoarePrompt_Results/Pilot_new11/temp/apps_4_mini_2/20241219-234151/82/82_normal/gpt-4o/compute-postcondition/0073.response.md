According to the code, the loop iterates over the values in the list `[k, diff // k]`. To execute one more time, we must consider the current value of `candidate` in the context of the provided list.

At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is already assigned one of the values from the list. The loop will maintain the behavior of iterating through all the candidates in the list, which consists of two elements: `k` and `diff // k`.

Given the values:
1. The loop would have run with `candidate` as `k` or as `diff // k` based on previous iterations.

To continue the loop execution:
- If `candidate` was `k`, the next candidate will be `diff // k`.
- If `candidate` was `diff // k`, there would be no more candidates left to iterate over (as the loop only covers these two elements).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the candidate must be updated to the next candidate in the list.

If the previous value of `candidate` is `k`, we can move to `candidate = diff // k`.
If `candidate` was `diff // k`, it indicates this was the end of iterations.

In order to account for the next iteration correctly, the state will reflect this possible progression.

State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; candidate is `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
