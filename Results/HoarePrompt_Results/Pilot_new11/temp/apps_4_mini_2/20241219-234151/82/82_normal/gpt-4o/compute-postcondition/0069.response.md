To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the executed code, particularly how `current_lcm` is assigned the result of the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

1. The initial state informs us that:
   - `a` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`.
   - `diff` is greater than 0, which implies `diff = |a - b|`.
   - The condition `int(math.sqrt(diff)) >= k + 1` means that the integer square root of `diff` is at least `k + 1`.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `candidate` is derived from `diff // k`.
   - `new_a` is calculated as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
   - `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

2. The execution of `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` means that `current_lcm` is now assigned the value returned by `func_2` when called with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. The exact value of `current_lcm` is not specified, but it depends on the definitions and implementations of `func_2`, which is not provided here.

3. From this operation, the values of `new_a` and `new_b` are computed, but we do not alter any of the original values of `a`, `b`, or the other variables. The only new piece of information we have after the code executes is the value of `current_lcm`.

Given this analysis, the output state must include all original variables while updating the information for `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate; current_lcm is the result of func_2(new_a, new_b)**.
