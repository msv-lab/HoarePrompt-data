Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer not equal to `a`; `diff` is greater than 0; `int(math.sqrt(diff))` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is a positive integer; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `diff // k`.***
