Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic necessary to find the minimal number of 90-degree clockwise rotations required to achieve the minimal deviation from vertical based on the camera rotation angle. 

Here's where it fails:

1. The program normalizes the angle `x` to a range of 0 to 359 degrees using `x = x % 360`. This is correct for handling the cyclic nature of angles, but it does not account for the fact that the input angle can be negative (representing a counter-clockwise rotation), which requires special handling.

2. The program then checks if the normalized angle is 0 and prints 0 if so, which is fine for cases where there is no rotation, but it does not handle cases where the angle is less than 0 effectively.

3. The calculation `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` will not give the correct number of 90-degree rotations in all cases. For instance, for a counter-clockwise angle of `-60`, the logic would yield:
   - The normalized angle of `-60` will become `300` after applying modulo operation (which is incorrect in terms of intended logic).
   - It then leads to evaluating how many 90-degree turns are needed to counteract that, providing misleading results.

The specific example of `-60` (counter-clockwise) is supposed to give 3 clockwise turns for minimal deviation, while the calculation would not produce this result correctly as per the logic in the existing implementation. The output for the test case `Input: -60` does not match with `Output: 3`, leading to a mismatch with expected behavior from the problem description.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the correctness is deemed **False**.
