The value of `x` is modified to be the remainder of `x` divided by 360, which ensures that `x` remains within the range of 0 to 359 degrees. The states of the other variables are not affected, just the value of `x` changes. Therefore, the Output State reflects this change.

Output State: **`x` is an integer representing the rotation angle of the camera in degrees, where `x` is now equal to `x % 360`.**
