Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified that the program aims to normalize the input angle and calculate the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed. However, it failed to adequately address the program's handling of the normalization process and its impact on producing accurate results. 

In the case of negative angles, the method used in the code calculates the number of required turns based on the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This could lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. For instance, a normalized angle of -60 results in 300 degrees being used in the calculation, which does indeed return the correct number of turns but does not effectively model the behavior expected for negative angles; specifically, it doesn't consider the clockwise nature of the rotations required for angles that deviate significantly from vertical.

Here's an example where the error becomes evident:
- For `x = -60`, the actual output would indeed be 3 turns, but the explanation brought up in the assessment under-represented potential ambiguity or misunderstanding of how rotations cumulative work when combining clockwise turns necessitated by counter-clockwise inputs.

Therefore, since the analysis and logic of the program doesn't align entirely with the expectation set forth in the problem description across various test cases (particularly around correct rotation handling), the final assessment should conclude that the program is not entirely correct as described, leading us to output **False**.
