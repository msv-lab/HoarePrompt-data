The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length that does not exceed 100 characters. After executing the function body, it will perform specific operations on this string and return a result based on those operations. However, since the output details are not provided, we cannot specify the exact return values or conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function can only be described in terms of the input parameter accepted.
