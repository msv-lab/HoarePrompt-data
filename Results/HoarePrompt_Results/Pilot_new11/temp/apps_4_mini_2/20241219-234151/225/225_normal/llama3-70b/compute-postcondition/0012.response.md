The variable `last_vowel` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The precondition states that `i` is initially 0 and `current value of s[i]` is a vowel. The values of `n`, `s`, and `max_jump` are not directly affected by this assignment, so they remain unchanged. 

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `last_vowel` is now 0. 

The other variables maintain their original conditions:
- `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0 (but now also represents the index of the last vowel).
- `max_jump` remains as it was prior to the update.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `last_vowel` is 0, and `max_jump` remains unchanged.**
