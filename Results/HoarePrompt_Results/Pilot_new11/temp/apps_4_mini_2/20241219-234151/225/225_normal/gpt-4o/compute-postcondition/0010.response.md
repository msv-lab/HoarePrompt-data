The variable `prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 1, so after the assignment, `prev_pos` will also be 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 1, `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, 1)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 1, `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, 1)`**.
