You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.


-----Examples-----
Input
ABABBBACFEYUKOTT

Output
4
Input
AAA

Output
1
Program:
```
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and check for any edge cases or potential failures:

The problem states that the Grasshopper seeks to find the maximum distance between consecutive vowels in the given string. Based on this distance, we can identify the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to traverse the string by only jumping on vowels.

Now, let's break down the program:

1. It reads a string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters.
2. It initializes a variable `max_jump` to 1 (the minimum potential jump).
3. It iterates through the string, checking each character to see if it's a vowel.
4. If a vowel is found, it updates the `max_jump` to the maximum of its current value and the distance from the last vowel found to the current vowel's index.
5. At the conclusion of the loop, it accounts for the jump from the last vowel to the end of the string.

### Potential Test Cases
- For input `"ABABBBACFEYUKOTT"`, the expected output is 4 (from 'E' to 'Y').
- For input `"AAA"`, expected output is 1.
- For input `"BCD"`, expected output is 3 (as there are no vowels, he must jump the length of the entire string).
- For input `"AAABBBCCCDDEEEE"`, expected output is 1 (as he can jump from one vowel to the next without having to jump far).
- For input `"BCDFGH"`, expected output is 6 (again, only consonants).

### Edge Cases Not Considered
1. If the entire string has no vowels, the Grasshopper won't be able to jump at all, leading to a potential failure in deriving a meaningful jump ability.
2. The program does not define what happens in cases where no vowels exist in the string. It may return a gap that is larger than the length of the string, leading to a non-meaningful result.

### Conclusion
Since the program doesn't address scenarios where there are no vowels, the algorithm could fail to provide a valid output. For this reason, it does not fully meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of capital English letters and calculates the maximum distance between consecutive vowels within the string. If no vowels are found, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the maximum distance either between vowels or from the last vowel to the end of the string. Notably, if the string contains no vowels, the return value does not reflect the length of the string minus the index of a last vowel (as stated in the return postconditions), but simply defaults to returning 1. The final state of the program thus includes returning this calculated maximum distance based on the presence and positions of vowels in the input string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
