Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in the string. If `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `max_jump` is updated to `new_max_jump`, which is calculated as the maximum of `old_max_jump` and half of the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string plus one.***
