Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is a vowel. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is updated to the maximum value between `max_jump` and 1. Otherwise, if `last_vowel` is not -1, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum value between `max_jump` and the result of the expression (0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1.***
