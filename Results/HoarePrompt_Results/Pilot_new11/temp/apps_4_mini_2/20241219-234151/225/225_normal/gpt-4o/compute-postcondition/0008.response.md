According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the string `s`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. The maximum value of `i` that would still allow the loop to run must be less than the length of the string `s`.

Given that `i` is currently 0 and the string `s` is non-empty, the length of `s` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1, and the loop will stay valid as long as `len(s)` is greater than 1. 

Thus, we adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, `max_jump` is updated based on the previous calculations**
