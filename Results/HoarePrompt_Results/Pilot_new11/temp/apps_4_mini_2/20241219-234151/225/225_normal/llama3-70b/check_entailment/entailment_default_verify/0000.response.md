Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where there are no vowels in the input string, which is a situation that can occur according to the problem description. In such cases, the program fails to provide a valid output when there are no vowels present. This demonstrates a failure to meet the requirements of the problem description, thus confirming the program's correctness is false.
