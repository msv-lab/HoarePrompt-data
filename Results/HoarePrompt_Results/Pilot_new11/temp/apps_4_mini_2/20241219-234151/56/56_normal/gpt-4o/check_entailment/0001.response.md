To determine the correctness of the provided Python program relative to the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

1. **Initialization**: The code reads `n` and `k` from input. It then checks if `k` is greater than `n`, in which case it returns "No". This is the correct check because if we require more parts than the sum itself, it's impossible to decompose `n` into `k` integers whose powers of two sum to `n`.

2. **Bits Extraction**: The program extracts the indices of the set bits in the binary representation of `n`. It uses a loop from 60 down to 0 to check each bit. This should correctly populate the list `bits` with the values of the powers of two that sum to `n`.

3. **Condition on Length of `bits`**: Here, the program checks if the length of `bits` (the number of distinct powers of 2 used) is greater than `k`. If it is, it returns "No". This condition also seems correct, as it means there are more unique powers required than the length of the sequence allowed.

4. **Adjusting to Length `k`**: The core logic that handles adjusting bits involves:
   - Popping the smallest element from `bits` (the smallest power of two that contributes to `n`).
   - Reducing this power by 1 and appending it twice to `bits`.
   - This process is repeated until the length of `bits` is equal to `k`.

   The above logic does work in theory but fails to ensure that:
   - The newly added powers must still be able to form valid powers of 2, adhering to possible negative powers, to sum back to `n`. This is critical, as powers of 2 less than `0` (e.g., -1) represent fractional values, potentially invalid combinations when forming integer sums.
   - Ensuring lexicographical order is fulfilled is dependent on the order of how bits are generated and manipulated.

5. **Sorting for Correct Output**: Finally, the code sorts `bits` in descending order. This is important for achieving the lexicographically largest sequence.

### Testing Example:
Consider the input `n = 1` and `k = 2`. The program should output "Yes" and provide a sequence. The correct output should be `-1 -1` because the only way to sum up `2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1`. 

However, if `k = 2`, the program will reach this condition:
- After finding that `len(bits)` is less than `k`, it will try to append some `-1` values to `bits`. Since there's a mismatch in our logic handling the powers, it may not yield the appropriate values.

Letâ€™s look at additional potential inputs:

- Input: `n = 2`, `k = 1`. This should return "Yes" and `1` because `2^1` is the only success as sum to `2` with `k = 1`. However, it may return "No" incorrectly if handled improperly.
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 2`. This also returns should return "Yes" with values like `1 0` which can represent `2^1 + 2^0 = 3`, but the behavior depends on how the bits are processed.

The processing detail for negative powers and ensuring they remain valid for integer representation based on the len(k) configurations where `2<num` needs extra handling.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, we conclude that the program fails to correctly handle the edge cases involving negative powers. The logic does not ensure the sufficiency of the sum representation for all possibilities of powers, which could lead to scenarios where it incorrectly returns valid cases for `n` while not truly being valid.

Correctness: **False**.
