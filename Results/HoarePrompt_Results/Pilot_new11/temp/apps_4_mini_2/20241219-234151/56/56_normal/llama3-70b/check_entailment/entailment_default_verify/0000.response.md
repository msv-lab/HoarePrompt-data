After analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the original assessment, I am aligned with the original assessment declaring the program incorrect. 

Here's the reasoning that supports this conclusion:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `n` and `k` Relationship**: The program checks if `n < k` to immediately output "No". This is insufficient. As noted in the original assessment, if `n` equals `k`, the program should output "Yes" with `k` occurrences of `0`, which is valid.

2. **Not Accounting for Pad Values**: The program only collects powers of two and does not consider filling the sequence with `-1` for cases where the number of collected items is less than `k`. This results in missing valid outputs as shown in the example with `n = 1` and `k = 2`, which should yield `(-1, -1)` as valid outputs. Thus, the output 'No' is incorrect in certain situations.

3. **Missing Checks for Valid Configurations**: The program does not include checks for configurations where it would only need to pad the entries with `-1` to make the total count `k`. Instead, it outright fails if the length doesn't meet the condition.

Considering these points, the program does not fulfill the requirements established by the problem description or the output hints given. Therefore, it misses valid scenarios and outputs incorrect results due to logical gaps.

Final: **False**
