Output State: **`len(bits)` is equal to `k`, `bits` contains set indices from the range of original `smallest - 1` values down to some minimum based on how many times the loop iterated, `smallest` has been decremented several times depending on how many times the loop executed, and `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). If `k` was initially greater than the length of `bits`, then the loop would have executed enough times to finalize `bits`'s length to exactly `k`.**
