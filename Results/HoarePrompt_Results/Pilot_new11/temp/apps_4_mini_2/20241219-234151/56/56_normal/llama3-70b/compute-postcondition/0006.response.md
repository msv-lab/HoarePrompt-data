According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer and specifically indicated to be greater than or equal to `k`, implying that `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already a positive integer, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted to ensure that the loop executes one time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `k` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
