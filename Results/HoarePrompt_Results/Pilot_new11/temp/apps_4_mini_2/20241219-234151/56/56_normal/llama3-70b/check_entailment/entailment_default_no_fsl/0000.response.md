Correctness: **False**

The provided code fails to account for the requirement that the sum of `k` integers (the powers of 2) must equal `n`. The logic for extracting bits from `n` correctly identifies the powers of two, but it does not allow for the case where we might need to combine or repeat lower powers of two adequately to fill the sequence with exactly `k` elements.

For instance, consider the case when `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The binary representation of 3 is `11`, which corresponds to `2^1 + 2^0`. While we could use `1` and `0`, the code as written will not be able to yield an output because it appends only the highest bits found (which is one instance of `1`). This results in `len(a) < k` being true, leading to a premature 'No' when in fact the sequence `(1, 1)` would satisfy both the sum condition (as `2^1 + 2^1 = 4`) if `1` was allowed twice, but the code restrictively only finds one instance of each power.

This demonstrates that there can exist cases for which valid sequences are not produced, confirming the code does not satisfy the problem's requirements in all cases. Thus, the determination of correctness is marked as False.
