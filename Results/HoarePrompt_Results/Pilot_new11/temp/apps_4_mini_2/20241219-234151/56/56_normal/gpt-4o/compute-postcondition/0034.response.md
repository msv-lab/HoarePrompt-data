Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^18) and `k` (a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000). It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of indices of set bits in `n` exceeds `k`. If the number of indices of set bits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it modifies the list of bit indices by adding decremented values until the list length equals `k`. Finally, it returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted list of these bit indices as a space-separated string. The function effectively checks the relationship between `n` and `k`, the number of set bits in `n`, and adjusts the indices of these bits as per the condition applied.**
