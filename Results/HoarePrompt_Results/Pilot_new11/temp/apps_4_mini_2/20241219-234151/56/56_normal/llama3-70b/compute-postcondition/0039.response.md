Functionality: **The function `func` takes two positive integers, `n` and `k`, as input. It first checks if `n` is less than `k`, printing 'No' and terminating if this is the case. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it initializes an empty list `a` and performs a loop where it decrements `n` by powers of two corresponding to the highest set bit until `n` becomes 0 or no higher bits can be found. The collected values (indexes of the bits) are stored in the list `a`. After the loop, if the list `a` contains fewer than `k` elements, it outputs 'No'. If it has at least `k` elements, it truncates `a` to the first `k` elements, sorts them in descending order, and prints 'Yes' followed by the space-separated values from `a`. The final state of `n` will be non-negative (possibly 0), retaining its original input value after function execution; `k` will also remain unchanged; if 'Yes' is printed, a contains the first `k` values sorted in descending order. If 'No' is printed at any point, a will not be printed. Overall, the function checks conditions and combats the binary representation of `n` while managing a list of bit positions until a defined output is achieved based on `k`.**
