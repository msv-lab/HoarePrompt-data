The line of code `bits.append(smallest - 1)` results in the following changes:

- The `bits` list is modified to include a new element, which is `smallest - 1`.
- The length of `bits` increases by 1.

Since the details of the initial state do not include the specific values of `smallest`, `bits`, or how many elements are in `bits`, we can deduce that `smallest` is valid and that it is the last element of `bits`. However, we do not know the specific values following this operation.

After executing the code, we will retain all other states:

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18),
- `k` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) and is greater than the previous length of `bits`,
- `smallest` remains the last element in the initial `bits`,
- `bits` now has one additional element, which is `smallest - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than the current length of bits; `smallest` is the last element of `bits`, and `bits` now includes the element `smallest - 1`, thus `bits` has increased in length by 1.**
