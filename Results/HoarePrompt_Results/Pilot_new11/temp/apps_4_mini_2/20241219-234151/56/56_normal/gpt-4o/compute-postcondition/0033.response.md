The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, with `n` constrained to the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `k` constrained to the range (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). Based on the conditions in the output:

- If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- If the number of indices of the set bits in `n` is greater than `k`, the function returns 'No'.
- If the number of indices of the set bits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns 'Yes', followed by the sorted indices of these set bits as a space-separated string.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and determine the relationship between their values and the set bits in `n`, returning appropriate responses based on those relationships. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k` and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n`, or if the number of set bits in `n` exceeds `k`. If the number of set bits is less than or equal to `k`, it returns 'Yes' followed by the sorted indices of the set bits as a space-separated string.**
