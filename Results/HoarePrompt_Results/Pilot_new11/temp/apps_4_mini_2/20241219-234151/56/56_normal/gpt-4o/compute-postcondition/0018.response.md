To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to assess the condition for executing the `while` loop. The loop checks whether `len(bits) < k` is true.

1. **Check the condition before the loop:**
   - `bits` contains the indices of the set bits in `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), at least some bits from the range 0 to 60 can be set depending on the value of `n`.
   - `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), and we know that `k` is less than or equal to `n`, which implies `k` can reasonably be less than or equal to the number of bits set in `n`.

2. **Determine the length of `bits`:**
   - The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute, the condition `len(bits) < k` must be true. This can occur if `len(bits)` is less than `k`.

3. **Possible adjustments:**
   - If `len(bits)` is currently equal to `k`, the condition would not hold true, and the loop would not execute.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust either `len(bits)` to be less than `k`. Given that the value of bits is determined by the set bits in `n`, we can infer that `n` must be such that there are fewer than `k` bits set.
   - Adjusting `k` is not viable as it must remain a positive integer. 

Thus, the adjustment required is ensuring `len(bits)` is less than `k` or that `k` should be greater than the current length of `bits`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) and must be greater than the current length of bits**.
