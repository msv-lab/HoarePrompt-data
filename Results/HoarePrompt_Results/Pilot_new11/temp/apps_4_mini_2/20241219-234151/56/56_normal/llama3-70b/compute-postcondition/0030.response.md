The code snippet `print('No')` outputs the string 'No' but does not modify any variables or states in the program. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0), `k` is the original positive integer, `a` is a list containing the values of `x` collected during the iterations, `i` is the total number of iterations executed (which corresponds to how many times `x` was appended to `a`), and the current length of `a` is less than `k`.**
