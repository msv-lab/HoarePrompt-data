Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately solve the problem as described. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the required sum `n` can be achieved using fewer integers than specified by `k`, or where the maximum integer in the output does not satisfy the condition of being minimized.

For instance, consider the input:

```
5 2
```

In this case, the program will output:

```
Yes
2 0
```

This output is incorrect because it indicates that we can represent `5` with two integers, where the maximum integer used is `2`, which is not the lexicographically largest valid sequence. The correct representation should be:

```
Yes
1 1
```

This represents `2^1 + 2^1 = 2 + 2 = 4`, not `5`. Therefore, since the program logic does not guarantee all edge cases, and especially the case where a valid solution cannot exist with the specified `k`, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem. Thus, there are many more inputs that can yield incorrect outputs compared to acceptable outputs.

Additionally, when `n` is less than `k` but `k` is allowed to represent negative integers (as stated in the problem), the program returns "No" prematurely without considering potential sequences of negative powers, leading to further inaccuracies. 

Therefore, since there are clear cases where the program does not yield the correct output aligning with the problem requirements, the overall evaluation of correctness is **False**.
