Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5), `k` is less than or equal to `n`, `bits` contains all the indices of the set bits in `n` (ranging from 0 to 60), and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`. If no bits are set, `bits` is an empty list.***
