The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `n` is greater than 0, and it remains unchanged because the code only affects `i`. The value of `a` is not affected either. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `a` now includes the value `x`, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` now includes the value `x`, `i` is increased by 1**.
