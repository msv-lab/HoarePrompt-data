The value of `x` is assigned the result of `n.bit_length() - 1`. Since `n` must remain greater than 0, `n.bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary. Therefore, `x` will be the bit length of `n` minus 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must remain greater than 0; `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
