Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0) now, `k` is the original positive integer, `a` is a list containing the values of `x` collected during the iterations, `i` is the total number of iterations executed (which corresponds to how many times `x` was appended to `a`), and for each iteration, `x` was equal to the bit length of the previous value of `n` minus 1.**
