Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and greater than 1; `t` is an input integer; `dir` is an input value. If `dir` is 'South' and `position + t` is greater than 20000, then `valid` is set to False and `position` is updated to `position + t`. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East' and `position` equals 0 or 20000, then `valid` is set to False.***
