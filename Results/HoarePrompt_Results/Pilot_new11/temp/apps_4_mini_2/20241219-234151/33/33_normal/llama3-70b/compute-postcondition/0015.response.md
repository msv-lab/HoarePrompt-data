The code snippet provided only prints the string 'NO' and does not affect any of the variables (`n`, `dir`, `curr_lat`). Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the fact that 'NO' has been printed to the console. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; if `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` is updated to 90 + t / 111.195; if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to 90 - t / 111.195; if `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', then `curr_lat` remains at 90. The current value of `curr_lat` is either less than -90 or greater than 90. 'NO' has been printed.**
