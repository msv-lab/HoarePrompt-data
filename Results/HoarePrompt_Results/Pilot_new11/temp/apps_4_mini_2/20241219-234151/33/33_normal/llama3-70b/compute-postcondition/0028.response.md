`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the string `t` to an integer. The value of `t` is now an integer, while `n` remains unchanged within the specified range and `dir` remains as a string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input.**
