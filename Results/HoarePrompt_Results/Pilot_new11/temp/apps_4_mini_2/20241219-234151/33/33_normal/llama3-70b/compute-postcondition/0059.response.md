Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input. If `curr_lat` is equal to 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the program execution has terminated. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', `curr_lat` remains unchanged and program execution has ended.***
