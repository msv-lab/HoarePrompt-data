The command `continue` does not change any variable values but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration if used within a loop structure. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `curr_lat` is 90; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string that is not equal to 'North' and is also not equal to 'South', and the loop iteration is continued.**
