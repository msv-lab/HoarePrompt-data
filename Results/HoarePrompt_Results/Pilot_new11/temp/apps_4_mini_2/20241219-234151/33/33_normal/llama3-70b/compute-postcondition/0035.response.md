The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, and therefore no further operations are performed. The values of all other variables remain unchanged, but the program will stop executing. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` is unchanged; program execution is terminated.**
