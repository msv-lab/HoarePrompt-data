The variables `t` and `dir` are assigned values from the input, which splits the entered input string into two parts. The specific values of `t` and `dir` depend on the user input and are not predetermined in the initial state. The value of `n` remains unchanged as this operation does not affect it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t` is a string assigned from input, `dir` is a string assigned from input**
