The value of `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`, where `t` is an integer but its value is not specified in the initial state. The variable `curr_lat` has its value changed, but the values of `n` and `dir` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195**
