Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input; if `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - (t / 111.195)`. If `dir` is not 'South', then `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.***
