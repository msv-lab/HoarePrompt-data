Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. `dir` is 'North', 'South', 'West', 'East', or neither, and during the last update, `position` was set to `0 - t`, `position` was updated to `position + t` where the sum exceeds 20000, or `position` was set to either 0 or 20000. The current value of `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, and `valid` is set to False. If `dir` was neither 'West' nor 'East', then the values of `n`, `position`, `valid`, or `t` remain unchanged.***
