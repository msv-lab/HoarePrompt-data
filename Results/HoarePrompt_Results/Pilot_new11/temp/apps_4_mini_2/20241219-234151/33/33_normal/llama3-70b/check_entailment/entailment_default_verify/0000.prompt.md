You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the conditions outlined in the problem.

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Initial Position**: The program starts Limak at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude).

2. **Processing each command**: For each journey instruction:
   - If the direction is "North", it increases the latitude.
   - If the direction is "South", it decreases the latitude.
   - The program uses a conversion factor of `111.195` to convert kilometers to degrees.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - If at any point the latitude goes below -90 or above 90, it prints "NO".
   - If Limak is at the South Pole (latitude = -90), he can only move "North".
   - If Limak is at the North Pole (latitude = 90), he can only move "South".

4. **Final Check**: At the end of the journey, it checks if Limak is back at the North Pole (latitude = 90). If he is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Moving East or West**:
   - Since Limak is restricted on the poles, a command to move "East" or "West" is ignored, but the conditions don’t state any consequences when such moves are attempted at the poles. If the move is ignored, **it does not affect the latitude**, and hence might not violate any conditions. However, the problem does not state that moving "East" or "West" is valid at the poles—there's no explicit handling of this situation.

2. **Insufficient movement to return**:
   - If Limak moves to South Pole directly and then a "North" move less than 20000 km, it should not be accepted as it cannot return to (or remain at) the North Pole.

3. **Mixed Direction Handling**:
   - If Limak starts with a command "North", it doesn't consider the case where he may end up over his starting point after the last 'South' move.

### Discovering Incorrect Behavior:
When analyzing these possibilities, we discover that:
- There’s no direct handling for a "West" or "East" move boundary situation.
- If Limak moves South completely (for instance with a command sequence of `20000 South`), then attempts partial north movement afterwards (like `1000 North`), he still has no evaluation against being able to fully return (there should be strict limits).

Given this, we can derive an example where this could potentially fail:
- Input:
```
5
20000 South
1000 North
5000 East
1000 North
10000 South
```
The program originally doesn't validate an East move while being at the south pole, leading to potentially incorrect return calculations, and the latitude may not correctly correspond to the journey requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of journey parts, followed by `n` pairs of inputs consisting of an integer `t` (representing distance in meters) and a direction string (`dir`) that can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". It updates the current latitude based on movements in the North and South directions, ignoring movements in the West and East. The latitude change is calculated using the approximation that 1 degree of latitude is equivalent to roughly 111,195 meters. 

After processing all journey parts, it checks whether the latitude remains within the valid bounds of -90 to 90 degrees. If any direction causes the latitude to exceed these bounds, or if the final latitude is either 90 or -90 without having moved appropriately in the opposite direction at least once, it prints 'NO' and exits the function. If the latitude remains within bounds and the necessary conditions are met for extreme latitudes, it prints 'YES' if the current latitude is 90, otherwise it prints 'NO'. 

Potential edge cases include:
- Ignoring any journey parts with directions other than "North" or "South".
- Only printing 'YES' if the ending latitude is exactly 90 and it confirms the necessary path taken; otherwise, it results in 'NO'.
- Any invalid movements that cause premature termination (i.e., when current latitude goes out of bounds during the journey processing).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
