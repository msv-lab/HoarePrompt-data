The `continue` statement in Python causes the loop to skip the rest of its code and jump to the next iteration of the loop. However, since this code snippet does not provide any context regarding the loop or any state changes for `n`, `t`, `dir`, or `curr_lat`, we conclude that none of the variables change.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer converted from its input string value; `dir` is a string assigned from input; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
