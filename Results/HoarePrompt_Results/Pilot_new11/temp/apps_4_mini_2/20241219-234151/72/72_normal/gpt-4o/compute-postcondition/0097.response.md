The value of `max_questions` is decreased by 1, but the initial state does not provide a specific value for `max_questions`. The conditions regarding other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 1, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 1, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1.**
