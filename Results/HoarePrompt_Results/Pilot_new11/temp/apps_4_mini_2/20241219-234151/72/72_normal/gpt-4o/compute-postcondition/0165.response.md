Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, and `col` is 2. If `direction` is 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1 and `row` is decremented by 2. If `direction` is not 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` equals -1, then `row` is updated to be the previous value of `row` plus 2.***
