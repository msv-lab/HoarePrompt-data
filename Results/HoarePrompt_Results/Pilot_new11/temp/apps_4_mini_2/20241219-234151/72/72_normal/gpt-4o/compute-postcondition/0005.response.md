The value of `remaining_questions` is assigned the value of `k % full_cycle_length`, which is the remainder when `k` is divided by `full_cycle_length`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, and `full_cycle_length` remain the same as there are no modifications made to them within the code. Therefore, the output state retains all the previous values and states of the variables while updating `remaining_questions`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `x` is an integer decreased by 1; `y` is `y - 1`; `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1`, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`; `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length`; `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`.**
