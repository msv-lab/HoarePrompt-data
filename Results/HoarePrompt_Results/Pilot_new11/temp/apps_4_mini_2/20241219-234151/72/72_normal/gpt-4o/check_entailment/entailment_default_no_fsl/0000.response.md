Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, there are issues with the calculation of the `max_questions` and `min_questions`, especially when `n` equals 1, where the seating pattern is fundamentally different.

1. **Single Row Case**: When there is only one row (`n=1`), the number of questions each pupil is asked should simply be `(k + m - 1) // m`, but the logic within the code does not handle this correctly. The values of `min_questions` and `max_questions` derived from the check with `(2 * n - 2)` do not apply when there is only one row. 

2. **Cyclic Behavior**: The way the rows are processed in the loop that calculates `remaining_questions` can produce inaccurate counts, particularly if there are very large values of `k`. The loop iterates `remaining_questions` without ensuring that the cyclic increment logic accurately reflects if the pupil is being asked or not, particularly in edge cases which may exceed the number of total pupils (e.g., in cases where `k` is significantly greater than the total number of pupils).

3. **Output Errors**: The calculation of the `sergei_questions` variable does not accommodate edge cases where Sergei is in the first or last position during repeated cycles, which means the program could undercount the number of times Sergei has been asked.

For example, for the input `1 2 8 1 1`, the expected output would be `4 4 4`, but the program would not reflect this correctly under current logic due to the aforementioned issues.

Considering these points, the code does not fulfill the problem requirements in all cases, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
