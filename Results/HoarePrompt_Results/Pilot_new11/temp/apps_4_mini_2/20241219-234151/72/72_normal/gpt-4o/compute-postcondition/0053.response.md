Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. If `direction` is 1 and `row` equals `n`, `row` is updated to the value of `row - 3`, `col` is set to 1, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, both `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` are increased by 1; `direction` is then set to -1. If `direction` is not 1 and `row` equals -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3`, `col` remains 1, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 while `max_questions` is decreased by 1.***
