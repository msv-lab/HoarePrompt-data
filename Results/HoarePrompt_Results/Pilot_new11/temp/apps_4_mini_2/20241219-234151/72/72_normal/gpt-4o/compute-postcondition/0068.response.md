Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `row` is either `x` or `x + 1` depending on the final `direction`, `direction` is 1 or -1 depending on the final row state, `sergei_questions` contains the count of times the condition `row == x and col == y` was true throughout the iterations, and `max_questions` has been incremented or decremented based on the number of iterations, ensuring it reflects the final calculation over all columns processed (0 to m-1).**
