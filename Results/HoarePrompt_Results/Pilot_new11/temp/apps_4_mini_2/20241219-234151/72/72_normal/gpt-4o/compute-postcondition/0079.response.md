The value of `row` is decremented by 2. Given that the current value of `row` is equal to `n`, after the operation, `row` will be `n - 2`. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 0, `row` is equal to `n - 2`, `direction` is -1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `row` was equal to `n`.**
