To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop operates. The loop is structured to iterate through the variable `col`, which is set to range from `0` to `m - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` and `m` are both greater than or equal to 1.
- `remaining_questions` is greater than 0.
- The value of `col` would be at its last position based on the previous iteration, which would be `col = m - 1` in the last iteration.

In order for the loop to execute again:
- `col` must increase and be less than `m`.
- Hence, the next value for `col` would be `m`, which is out of the range for the next iteration.

Therefore, in order for the loop to run one more time:
- We need to have `col` equal to `m`, which means that `m` must be greater than `col` at the current state for it to potentially run again.
- We are currently at the last valid `col` (which is `m - 1`). So, for the next iteration, we can assume `col` would be incremented to `m`.

Thus, we adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, remaining_questions is greater than 0, col is equal to m, row is unchanged (as we are only iterating over col)**
