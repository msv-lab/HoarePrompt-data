The value of `row` is increased by `direction`. The values of `n`, `m`, `remaining_questions`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains similar to the initial state, but `row` is updated by adding the value of `direction`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `row` is updated to `row + direction`, `col` is 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1.**
