The value of `direction` is assigned `-1`. The initial states of `n`, `m`, and `remaining_questions` remain unchanged, as well as `col`. The variable `row` becomes equal to its previous value plus `direction`, which means `row` is decreased by 1. Given that `row` is updated based on the new value of `direction`, the values of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is now equal to its previous value minus 1.**
