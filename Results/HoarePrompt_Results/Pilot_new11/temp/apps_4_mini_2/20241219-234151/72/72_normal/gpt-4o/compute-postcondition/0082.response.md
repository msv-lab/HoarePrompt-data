The operation `max_questions -= 1` decreases the value of `max_questions` by 1. The other variables retain their previous values, as they are not affected by this operation. The given initial state does not define an explicit value for `max_questions`, only that it's greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, after the decrement, `max_questions` will still be greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is 0, `row` is either `x` or `x + 1`, `direction` is -1, and `max_questions` is at least 0 (decreased by 1).**
