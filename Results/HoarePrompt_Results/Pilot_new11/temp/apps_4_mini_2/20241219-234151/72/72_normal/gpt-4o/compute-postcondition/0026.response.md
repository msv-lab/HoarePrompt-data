Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1; `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`; `sergei_questions` is either `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1) + 1` or `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x) + 1`; `max_questions` is equal to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + 1`; `row` is equal to `x`; `col` is equal to `y`; `direction` is 1; `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0; and the current value of `direction` is 1. The values of `row` and `col` are equal to `x` and `y`, respectively.**
