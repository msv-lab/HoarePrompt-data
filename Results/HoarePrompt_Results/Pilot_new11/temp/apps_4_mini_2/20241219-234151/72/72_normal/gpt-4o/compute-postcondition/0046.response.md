The statement `row -= 2` decrements the value of `row` by 2. The initial condition states that the previous value of `row` is updated to `row + direction`, which means `row` was set to `row - 1` before this operation. 

Since `row` is updated to `row - 1`, after that, executing `row -= 2` means we will decrease the new value of `row` by 2. So the final value of `row` after both updates will be:

New `row` = (Old `row` - 1) - 2 = Old `row` - 3

The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided conditions. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `row` is old `row` - 3, `col` is 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `direction` is -1.**
