The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are assigned new values from the user input through the `map(int, input().split())`. Since these variables are positive integers, after the execution, their specific values will depend on the input provided but they will remain within the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are new positive integers that satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.**
