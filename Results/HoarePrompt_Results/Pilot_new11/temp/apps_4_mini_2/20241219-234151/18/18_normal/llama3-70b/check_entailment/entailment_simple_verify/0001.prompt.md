You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0. 

  At time 1, the first spectator stands.  At time 2, the second spectator stands.  ...  At time k, the k-th spectator stands.  At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.  At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.  ...  At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.  At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.  ...  At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits. 

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).


-----Output-----

Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 5 3

Output
3

Input
10 5 7

Output
5

Input
10 5 12

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.

  At t = 0  ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.  At t = 1  ^--------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 2  ^^-------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 3  ^^^------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 4  ^^^^------ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 5  ^^^^^----- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 6  -^^^^^---- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 7  --^^^^^--- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 9  ----^^^^^- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 10 -----^^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 5.  At t = 11 ------^^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 4.  At t = 12 -------^^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 3.  At t = 13 --------^^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 2.  At t = 14 ---------^ $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 1.  At t = 15 ---------- $\Rightarrow$ number of standing spectators = 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the logic of the code against different scenarios.

The program is designed to calculate the number of spectators standing at a specific time `t`. The key parts of the wave process based on the input parameters `n`, `k`, and `t` are as follows:

1. For the first `k` seconds (from `t = 1` to `t = k`), the number of standing spectators is equal to `t` since each spectator stands up one by one.
2. From time `t = k + 1` to `t = n`, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k`, because as one spectator stands (the next in line), the first that stood up sits down.
3. After `t = n`, the sequence starts to decrement the number of standing spectators until `t = n + k` reaches zero spectators.

To analyze the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

- For the first `k` seconds (`t <= k`): The program returns `min(t, k)`, which correctly corresponds to the growing number of spectators standing (1, 2, ..., k).
- For `t = k + 1` to `t = n`: The condition `t <= n` becomes false, and it goes to the next calculation.
  - When `t > n`, it calculates standing spectators as `k - (t - n) % k`. This is where it starts to track how many spectators are still standing as time continues beyond `n`.
  
To verify this handles each case:

1. **Input:** `10 5 3` -> Expected `3`: `min(3, 5)` -> Outputs `3` (Correct)
2. **Input:** `10 5 7` -> Expected `5`: Condition is `False`, so it checks `k - (7 - 10) % 5`, which is `5`. (Correct)
3. **Input:** `10 5 12` -> Expected `3`: Now `k - (12 - 10) % 5`, which computes to `3`. (Correct)

To explore potential edge cases:
- **Input:** `10 5 1` -> Expected `1`: Outputs `1`, (Correct)
- **Input:** `10 5 6` -> Expected `5`: This is `k` which is returned correctly. (Correct)
- **Input:** `10 5 15` -> Expected `0`: Here, `(15 - 10) % 5` calculates correctly down to `0`. (Correct)

Now checking one problematic case:
- **Input:** `10 5 14` would hypothetically represent `1` standing if it hits `n+4` (outside the n+k range check). This would return a negative standing, potentially leading inconsistently. 

So we notice:
- The modulus operation can conflict when `t` hits exact intervals (like `t = k + j*k` where j >= 1) because it could decrease incorrectly, hence failing the edge conditions of standing count.

Thus, the output is incorrect at least for some specific constructed inputs.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
