To evaluate the output state, we must analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. 

1. The code uses a conditional expression to determine the output based on the value of `t`.
2. If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, then the output is `min(t, k)`. This means:
   - If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the result will be `t`.
   - If `t` is greater than `k`, the result will be `k`.
3. If `t` is greater than `n`, the output is computed as `k - (t - n) % k`. This expression calculates the value based on the difference between `t` and `n`, taking modulo with `k`.

The output will depend on the specific values of `t`, `k`, and `n`.

Therefore, the Output State will express the value derived from the calculation. Since the specific values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are user-defined integers, we can conclude our answer without specific numerical values.

Output State: **If t ≤ n, output is min(t, k); else output is k - (t - n) % k. `n`, `k`, and `t` are user-defined integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k.**
