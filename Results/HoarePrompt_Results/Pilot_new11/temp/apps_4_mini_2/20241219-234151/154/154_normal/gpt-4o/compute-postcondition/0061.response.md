The line `subtasks_solved = 0` assigns the value `0` to `subtasks_solved`. Since `subtasks_solved` was already `0`, its value remains unchanged. Thus, the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `k + 1`, `complete_tasks` is 2, `points` is equal to 2 * (k + 1), `remaining_time` is equal to `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, and `remaining_time` is less than 0.**
