Postcondition: ***`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, 0 + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is 0, `remaining_time` is less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. If `time_used` exceeds `M`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining all other variable conditions as specified.***
