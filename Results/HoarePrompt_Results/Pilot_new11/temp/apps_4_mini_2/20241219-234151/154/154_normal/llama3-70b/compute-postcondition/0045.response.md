The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. We know that `i` is `2` and `j` is `3`, so the statement is effectively updating `dp[2][3]` with the value from `dp[2][2]`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `dp[2][3]` is set to `dp[2][2]`.**
