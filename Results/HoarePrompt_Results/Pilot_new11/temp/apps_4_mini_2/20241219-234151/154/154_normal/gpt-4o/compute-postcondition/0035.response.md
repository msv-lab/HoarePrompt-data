`subtasks_solved` is explicitly assigned the value `0`. Since there is no other operation that affects the values of the variables, all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `subtasks_solved` is now `0`, while the other variables maintain their previous constraints and values.

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, 0 + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - total_time_per_task` and it is still less than 0; `subtasks_solved` is now 0.**
