The given code snippet updates the `dp` array using the logic that for each `i` (a row index) and `j` (a column index), it calculates the maximum possible value. The values of `dp[i][j]` are dependent on the previously calculated states of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]`.

The precondition indicates:
- `n` is between 1 and 45.
- `k` is between 1 and 45.
- `M` is up to 2·10^9 (must be greater than or equal to 2).
- `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user.
- `dp[1][1]` is equal to 0.
- `dp[i][2]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`.

The code directly impacts the values in the `dp` array, specifically updating `dp[i][j]`.

However, the particular values of `i`, `j`, and the elements of `t` at any point in time, along with the resulting values of `dp`, are indeterminate as they depend on additional inputs (namely `i`, `j`, and the specific state of `t`). Therefore, we note that `dp[i][j]` will now hold the maximum value obtained through the defined operation, which leverages previously defined conditions.

Given these updates, the Output State remains indirect as we cannot explicitly get the updated values without specific `i` and `j`. Therefore, we state that these variables interact but do not specify them:
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45; `k` is between 1 and 45; `M` is up to 2·10^9; `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user; `dp[1][1]` is equal to 0; `dp[i][2]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`; `dp[i][j]` is updated as per the operation defined.**
