Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `dp[i][2]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`, `dp[i][3]` is equal to `dp[i][1]`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`.***
