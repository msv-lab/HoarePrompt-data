The variable `time_used` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. The values of `complete_tasks` and `total_time_per_task` are unchanged; however, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in the list `t`. The specific values of `complete_tasks` (which is 0) and `total_time_per_task` (the sum of the integers in `t`) are not specified, but it can be inferred that `time_used` will be 0 because `complete_tasks` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers in the range 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in the list `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is 0.**
