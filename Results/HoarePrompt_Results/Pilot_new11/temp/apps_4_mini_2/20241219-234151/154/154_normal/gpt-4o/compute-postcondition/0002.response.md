According to the code, the for loop will execute `n + 1` times, as `complete_tasks` will take values from `0` to `n` inclusive. Therefore, for this loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `0`, which it already is because it's given that `1 ≤ n ≤ 45`. Thus, we can state that the conditions already meet the requirement for the loop to execute.

The `complete_tasks` variable will start at `0` on the first iteration. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `max_points`) are not directly influencing the capability of the loop to execute in this case.

State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers in the range 1 ≤ `t[j]` ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in the list `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0**
