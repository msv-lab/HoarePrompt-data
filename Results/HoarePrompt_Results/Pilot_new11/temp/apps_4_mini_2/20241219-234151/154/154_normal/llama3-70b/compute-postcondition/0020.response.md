According to the code, the loop is set to execute for `j` from 1 to `M`, and since `M` can go up to 2Â·10^9, the loop can execute as long as `M` is at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, the values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` must be considered to ensure appropriate states. Given that `n` and `k` are between 1 and 45, these values do not affect the execution of the loop except indirectly through their influence on the DP array if relevant to the loop body.

- `M` needs to be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The initial state of `j` is implicit as the loop starts at 1.

So, for the loop to be executed:
- `M` must be at least 1.
- `j` initially is 1, aligning with the loop's starting condition.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` must be at least 1, `j` is 1**.
