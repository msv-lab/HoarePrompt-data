To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let us analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs:** 
   - `n`: Number of tasks.
   - `k`: Number of subtasks per task.
   - `M`: Total minutes available.
   - `t`: List of integers representing time required for each subtask.

2. **Output:** 
   - The maximum number of points Polycarp can earn in `M` minutes.
   - Points are earned by solving subtasks, with bonus points given for completely solving all subtasks of a task.

3. **Logic to implement:**
   - Solve as many subtasks as possible in a given time `M`.
   - Determine the number of completed tasks to award the extra points.

### Program Analysis:
The logic in the provided program makes use of dynamic programming to calculate the number of subtasks that can be completed in `M` minutes.

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction:**
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved using up to `j` minutes considering the first `i` subtasks.
   - The core idea is that for each time `j`, it checks whether it can include the current subtask at time `t[i-1]`. If it can, then it updates the maximum subtasks that can be achieved.
   
2. **Summation of Results:**
   - The sum of the last rows of `dp` gives the total subtasks completed.
   - Additionally, the program checks how many tasks were completely solved at full `M` minutes and adds that to the score.

### Potential Issue:
- The program does not take into account the number of total tasks `n`. This is a crucial aspect of the problem since it indicates how many tasks can be generated for solving the subtasks.
- There can be scenarios where Polycarp can completely solve subtasks for more tasks than time allows if subtasks are not fully utilized by accounting for `n`.

### Example Case:
Consider an example:
- Input: `n = 2`, `k = 3`, `M = 10`, and subtasks `t = [1, 2, 3]`
  
  - For these inputs, the optimal output should be 5 because:
    - He can fully solve both tasks (1 + 2 + 3 from the first task and 1 + 2 + 3 from the second task totals 12 minutes needed, but only 10 minutes available).
    - However, if he optimally solves 5 subtasks in 10 minutes from two tasks without the program accounting for limiting to `n`, the behavior would yield an incorrect representation of potential completions. 

In this case, the program fails to correctly account for the maximum number of points achievable, failing to limit the calculations based on `n`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to consider the number of tasks `n` in conjunction with the available minutes `M`, leading to a potential situation where the maximum points calculated breach the task constraints outlined in the problem description.
