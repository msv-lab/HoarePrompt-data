According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to M, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `M` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing. The current state indicates that `M` is at least 1, but for another iteration, `M` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` must be at least 2, and `j` is 2**
