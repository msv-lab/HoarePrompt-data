The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters as defined. However, it has constraints on `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` which can be inferred to be inputs to the function. Here, `n` is an integer in the range of 1 to 45, `k` is also an integer in the range of 1 to 45, `M` is a non-negative integer up to 2·10^9, and `t` is a list containing `k` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000. 

As for the output, since no specific conditions or return values are defined in the prompt, we cannot establish any cases or specific return values related to the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and t, where n is an integer between 1 and 45, k is an integer between 1 and 45, M is a non-negative integer up to 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers between 1 and 1,000,000. However, the output behavior based on these inputs is not specified.**
