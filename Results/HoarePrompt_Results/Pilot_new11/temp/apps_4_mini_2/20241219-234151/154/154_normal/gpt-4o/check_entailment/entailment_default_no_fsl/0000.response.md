Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where there is insufficient time (M = 0). In such a scenario, Polycarp would not be able to solve any subtasks. However, the program's logic will attempt to find solutions even when zero minutes are available. The point calculating mechanism within the nested loop (for subtasks) may yield incorrect results since it does not account for the case where no time is available to solve any subtasks or complete any tasks. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1 0
1
```
Here, Polycarp has 0 minutes available to solve any subtasks. The expected output should be 0 points, yet the current implementation may inadvertently allow for the calculation of points based on subtasks, despite not having any time to complete them.

Thus, since there are cases where the program does not yield the correct output according to the problem description, the correctness is deemed **False**.
