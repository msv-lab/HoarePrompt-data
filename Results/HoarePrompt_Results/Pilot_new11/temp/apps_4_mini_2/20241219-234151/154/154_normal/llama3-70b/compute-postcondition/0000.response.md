The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are assigned the results of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input()` accepts user input and `map(int, ...)` converts the split input to integers. The specific values of `n`, `k`, and `M` will be determined by the user's input but remain within their specified ranges: `n` and `k` between 1 and 45, and `M` as a non-negative integer up to 2Â·10^9. The list `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is a non-negative integer up to 2Â·10^9, and `t` is a list of k integers where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are updated based on the user input.**
