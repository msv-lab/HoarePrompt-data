In this code snippet, `points` is assigned the value of `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. Given that `complete_tasks` is equal to 1, we substitute this value into the equation. Therefore, the value of `points` becomes `1 * (k + 1)`, which simplifies to `k + 1`.

The conditions for the other variables remain unchanged, and we do not have specific values for `k` or `points` prior to this operation. However, we can state the new value of `points`.

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, 0 + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is less than 0, and `subtasks_solved` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.**
