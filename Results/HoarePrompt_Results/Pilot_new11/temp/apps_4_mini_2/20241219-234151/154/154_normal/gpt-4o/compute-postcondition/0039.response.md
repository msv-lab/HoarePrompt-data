Subtasks_solved is assigned the value of `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `subtasks_solved` is now 0, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is less than or equal to 0. Thus, the new value of `subtasks_solved` will not change; it will remain at 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `max(0, 0 + subtasks_solved)`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is less than 0, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `subtask_time` is the first element in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is less than or equal to 0.**
