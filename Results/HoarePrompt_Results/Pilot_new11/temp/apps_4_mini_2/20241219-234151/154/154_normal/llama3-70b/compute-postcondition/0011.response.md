The code assigns the value of `dp[i][j - 1]` to `dp[i][j]`. Since `j` is equal to 2, this means that `dp[i][2]` will now hold the value of `dp[i][1]`. The initial state specifies that `dp[1][1]` is equal to 0, so `dp[i][2]` will be set to the value of `dp[i][1]`, which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is up to 2Â·10^9 (must be greater than or equal to 2), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers inputted by the user, `dp[1][1]` is equal to 0, `dp[i][2]` is equal to 0.**
