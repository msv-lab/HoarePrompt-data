In the provided code snippet, `max_points` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. 

- Initially, `max_points` is `0`.
- The expression `points + subtasks_solved` results in `k + 1 + 0`, which simplifies to `k + 1`.

Since `max_points` is being compared with `k + 1`, the new value of `max_points` will be either `0` (if `k + 1` is less than or equal to 0) or `k + 1` (if it is greater).

Given that `k` is between `1` and `45`, the minimum value of `k + 1` is `2`. Therefore, `max_points` will be updated to `k + 1`, since it will always be greater than `0`.

The other variables remain unchanged, including `subtasks_solved`, which is `0`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 45, `k` is such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of integers with `k` elements, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of `t`, `max_points` is equal to `k + 1`, `complete_tasks` is 1, `time_used` is equal to `total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `k + 1`, `remaining_time` is equal to `M - total_time_per_task` (and is less than 0), and `subtasks_solved` remains 0.**
