You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided code, we must analyze the program based on the problem description.

The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn given a certain amount of time (M minutes) to solve n tasks, each composed of k subtasks. The points earned are calculated both from individual subtasks solved and an additional point if all subtasks of a task are completed.

Let's analyze the `func_1` function:

1. It calculates the total time required to complete one full task (`total_time_per_task = sum(t)`).
2. It iterates through the number of complete tasks Polycarp can accomplish (`complete_tasks`).
3. For each number of complete tasks, it calculates how much time would be used and the corresponding points.
4. It checks remaining time after completing those tasks and attempts to maximize additional subtasks solved within the remaining time.
5. It uses a greedy approach to decide how many subtasks can be solved with the remaining time.

However, there are potential edge cases that might not be handled correctly:

- If `M` is 0, Polycarp cannot solve any subtasks, yet the program calculates points based on tasks that cannot be completed.
- The program does not properly account for exceeding the maximum number of tasks or subtasks (i.e., when remaining subtasks exceed the total available tasks post-completion of complete tasks).
- In cases where `n` or `k` is at its minimum (like 1), it might lead to unexpected results if there's not enough time. The implementation assumes he can solve at least one subtask each time without checking the limits.
- Additionally, if `M` is less than the smallest subtask time, he can’t solve any subtask (which should lead to a direct output of `0` points). 

**Example Input to Demonstrate Failure:**
- For `n = 1`, `k = 1`, `M = 0`, and `t = [1]`, the correct output should be `0`, but the current implementation would still calculate points from the loops without correctly functioning to output `0` directly in this case.

Based on this analysis, we identify that the program may not function as intended for certain edge cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, M is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, and t is a list of k integers where each integer t[j] (1 ≤ j ≤ k) is in the range 1 ≤ t[j] ≤ 1000000.

    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):

        if time_used > M:
            break

                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is between 1 and 45, `k` is between 1 and 45, `M` is between 0 and 2·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of the elements in `t`, `max_points` is the maximum possible points achievable based on complete_tasks and subtasks solved, `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is equal to `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `(n * (k + 1))`, `remaining_time` is non-negative or zero (if the total time used is less than or equal to M), and `subtasks_solved` is equal to the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time.
    return max_points
    #The program returns the maximum possible points achievable based on complete_tasks and subtasks solved, where complete_tasks is `n` and `max_points` is calculated based on the relevant parameters.
