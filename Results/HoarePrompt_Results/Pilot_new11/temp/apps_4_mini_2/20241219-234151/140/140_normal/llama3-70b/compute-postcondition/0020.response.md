Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, and `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, and `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors. If the function `func_1` returns True when processing the `neighbor`, it indicates that the current node has been successfully visited and processed in the graph traversal.***
