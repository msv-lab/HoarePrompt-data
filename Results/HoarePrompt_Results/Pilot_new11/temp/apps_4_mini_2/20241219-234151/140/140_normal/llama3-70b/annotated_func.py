#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing directed edges from the corresponding vertex, visited is a list of booleans indicating if a vertex has been visited, and rec_stack is a list of booleans indicating if a vertex is part of the current recursion stack.
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `visited` indicates all reachable nodes from `node` that were processed, and there is no cycle detected in neighbors of `node`.
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that no cycle is detected in the neighbors of node in the graph.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function 'func_1' accepts a vertex identifier 'node', a directed graph represented as a list of lists 'graph', a list 'visited' indicating which vertices have been accessed, and a list 'rec_stack' to track the vertices in the current recursion stack during depth-first search. It performs a cycle detection operation in the directed graph starting from the specified node. After execution, if the function detects a cycle that includes the node, it returns True; otherwise, it completes the traversal of reachable vertices and returns False, indicating that no cycle has been found in that part of the graph. The lists 'visited' and 'rec_stack' are modified to reflect the updated visitation and recursion state of the vertices. Given the absence of certain checks, such as for out-of-bounds indices or empty graphs, it may encounter errors or unexpected behavior under such conditions, which are not addressed in the current implementation.
