Functionality: **The function 'func_1' accepts a vertex identifier 'node', a directed graph represented as a list of lists 'graph', a list 'visited' indicating which vertices have been accessed, and a list 'rec_stack' to track the vertices in the current recursion stack during depth-first search. It performs a cycle detection operation in the directed graph starting from the specified node. After execution, if the function detects a cycle that includes the node, it returns True; otherwise, it completes the traversal of reachable vertices and returns False, indicating that no cycle has been found in that part of the graph. The lists 'visited' and 'rec_stack' are modified to reflect the updated visitation and recursion state of the vertices. Given the absence of certain checks, such as for out-of-bounds indices or empty graphs, it may encounter errors or unexpected behavior under such conditions, which are not addressed in the current implementation.**
