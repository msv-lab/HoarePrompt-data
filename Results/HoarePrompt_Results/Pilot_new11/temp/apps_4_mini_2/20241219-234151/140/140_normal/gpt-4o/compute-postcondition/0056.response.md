Postcondition: ***`in_degree` has at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` has `n` keys; `neighbor` remains the same; `node` remains the same; `count` is the same or increased by 1 if another neighbor was processed; `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `queue` now includes `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was zero.***
