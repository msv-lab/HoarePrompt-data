Output State: **`in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all neighbors of `node`; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` maintains its structure with `n` keys; `queue` contains all neighbors of `node` that had their in-degree reduced to zero, `node` is the element that was removed from `queue`, and `count` is increased by the number of neighbors that were processed with an in-degree of 0.**
