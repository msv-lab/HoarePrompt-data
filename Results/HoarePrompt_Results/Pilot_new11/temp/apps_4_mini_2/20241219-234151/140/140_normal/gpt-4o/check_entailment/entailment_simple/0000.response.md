Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for determining whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

### Reasons for Incorrectness:

1. **Cycle Detection Implementation**:
   - The function `has_cycle(graph)` is used to check for cycles in the graph. However, the implementation here is fundamentally flawed for the purpose of detecting cycles correctly in a directed graph. It uses a topological sorting approach (`Kahn's algorithm`), but it may not cover all scenarios, such as cases where back edges create a cycle.

2. **Handling of Edge Removal**:
   - In the main function `func_1`, the program removes an edge and then checks for cycles in the modified graph. While this approach may seem reasonable at first glance, if there's a scenario with multiple edges creating cycles, simply removing one edge may not be sufficient for detecting cycles properly after the removal.

3. **Returning Values**:
   - The problem description states that the output should be "YES" or "NO". However, the program returns 'YES' or 'NO' encapsulated in strings instead of outputs formatted as instructed.

4. **Completeness**:
   - The program does not explicitly account for the condition where no edge removal is needed at all if the graph is already acyclic.

### Conclusion

The combination of incorrect cycle detection and improper edge removal handling indicates that the program does not consistently meet the specifications outlined in the problem description for all potential graph configurations. Therefore, the assertion about its correctness is false.
