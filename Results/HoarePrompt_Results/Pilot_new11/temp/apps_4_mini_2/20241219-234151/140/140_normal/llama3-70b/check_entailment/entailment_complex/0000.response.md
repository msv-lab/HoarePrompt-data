The provided program aims to detect whether it is possible to make a directed graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. It performs this by checking for cycles in the directed graph using depth-first search (DFS). Here's the analysis:

1. **Cycle Detection**: The program uses a recursive function `func_1` which detects cycles in the directed graph. It utilizes a recursion stack (`rec_stack`) to track the vertices that are currently being explored. If it encounters a vertex that is already in the recursion stack during its exploration, this indicates the presence of a cycle.

2. **Handling Cycles**: The program checks all nodes, so if it finds a cycle from any starting point, it declares that the graph is not acyclic and prints 'NO'. If no cycles are found, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Missing Functionality for Edge Removal**: However, the problem description states that it is required to determine if the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. The existing implementation does not account for the possibility of removing an edge; it only checks if the graph currently has a cycle. 

   - For instance, if a graph has multiple cycles that can be broken by removing a single edge, the program would not be able to identify that it is possible to achieve an acyclic graph; it would simply return 'NO' if it finds a cycle.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the program does not consider the case where removing an edge can yield an acyclic graph, it does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description. The absence of logic to test the removal of edges specifically means the program cannot assess all possible configurations, leading to potential incorrect outcomes based on the input graph structure.

Given this reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of checking if the directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge.

Correctness: **False**
