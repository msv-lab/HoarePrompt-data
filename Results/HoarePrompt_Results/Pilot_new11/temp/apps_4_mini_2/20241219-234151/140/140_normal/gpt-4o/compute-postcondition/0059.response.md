The code `queue.append(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The values of `in_degree`, `n`, `graph`, `node`, and `count` remain unchanged. The updated state reflects that `neighbor` is now part of the `queue`.

Output State: **`in_degree` has at least one neighbor of `node` with an in-degree of 0; `n` is between 2 and 500; `graph` has `n` keys; `neighbor` is the next unprocessed neighbor in `graph[node]`; `node` remains the same; `count` is the same or increased by 1 if another neighbor was processed; `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1; `neighbor` is in `queue`.**
