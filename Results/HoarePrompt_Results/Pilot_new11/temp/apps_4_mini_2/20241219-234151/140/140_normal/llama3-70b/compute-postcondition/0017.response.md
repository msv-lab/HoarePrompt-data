Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, and `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors. If `visited[neighbor]` is False, and if `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, the function returns True; otherwise, there is no specified return value. If `visited[neighbor]` is True, the function returns True if `rec_stack[neighbor]` is also True, indicating successful traversal or processing of the node.***
