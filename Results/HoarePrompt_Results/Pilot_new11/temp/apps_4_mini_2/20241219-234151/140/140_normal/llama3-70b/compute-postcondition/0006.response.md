Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer, `graph` is a list of lists of integers, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `graph[node]` is not empty, `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `graph[node]`, `visited[neighbor]` is False, and the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns False.***
