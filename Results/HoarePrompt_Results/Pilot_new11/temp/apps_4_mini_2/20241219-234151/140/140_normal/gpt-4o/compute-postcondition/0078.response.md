Output State: **`in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees after processing all neighbors of `node`, `queue` contains all neighbors of `node` that have their in-degree reduced to 0, `n` is between 2 and 500, `graph` maintains its structure with `n` keys, `node` has no remaining neighbors in `graph`, `count` is increased by the number of neighbors processed.**
