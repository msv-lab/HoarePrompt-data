Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program uses a depth-first search (DFS) method to detect cycles in a directed graph. However, it does not account for the requirement of only being allowed to remove at most one edge to make the graph acyclic.

A cycle can exist in a directed graph, and while the program effectively identifies if a cycle is present, it fails to check whether it is possible to break that cycle by removing just one edge. 

For example, consider the following case:

```
Input
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 1
1 4
```

This represents a directed graph with a cycle (1 → 2 → 3 → 1) and one additional edge (1 → 4) that does not contribute to the cycle. The program will incorrectly output 'NO' because it only checks if there's any cycle without assessing whether removing a single edge can break it. In this case, removing the edge 2 → 3 would result in an acyclic graph, but the program does not handle this logic.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for all potential cases.
