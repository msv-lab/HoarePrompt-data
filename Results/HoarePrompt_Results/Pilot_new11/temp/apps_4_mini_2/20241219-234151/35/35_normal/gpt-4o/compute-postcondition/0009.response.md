`mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The values of `low` and `high` are not specified, but it is noted that `low` must be strictly less than `high`. Therefore, `mid` will be a calculated integer value based on the current values of `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b; `low` is strictly less than `high`; `mid` is equal to (low + high) // 2.**
