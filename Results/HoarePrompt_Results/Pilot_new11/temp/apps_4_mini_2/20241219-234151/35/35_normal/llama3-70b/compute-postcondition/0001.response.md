The variable `x` is assigned the value of the minimum among `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, and both `a` and `b` are guaranteed to be between 1 and 100, the possible values of `x` can range from 1 up to the smallest of these three integers (`n`, `a`, or `b`). The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` is an input integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100); `b` is an input integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100); `x` is equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`).**
