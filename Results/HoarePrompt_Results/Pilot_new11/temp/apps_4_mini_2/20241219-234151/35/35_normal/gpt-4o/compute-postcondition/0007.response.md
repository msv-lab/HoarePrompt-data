Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b. If `can_distribute(mid)` returns true, `low` is updated to (1 + (min(a, b) + 1)) // 2 + 1, `high` remains min(a, b) + 1, and `mid` is (1 + (min(a, b) + 1)) // 2. Otherwise, `low` remains 1, `high` is updated to (1 + (min(a, b) + 1)) // 2, and `mid` is (1 + (min(a, b) + 1)) // 2.***
