#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b, a is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, and b is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high` (which is min(a, b) + 1 if the loop exited without executing `can_distribute(mid)`), indicating the value that cannot be distributed further, while `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b; `mid` holds the last calculated midpoint value, depending upon the final evaluation of `can_distribute(mid)`; if the loop executed at least once and `can_distribute(mid)` returned true at least once, the last value of `low` will have been adjusted to one more than at least one of the `mid` values computed during the loop.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns the value of low which is adjusted to indicate the last possible distributed value, thus returning low - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, and two positive integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of pieces of two cakes. It performs a binary search to determine the maximum number of pieces (`low - 1`) that can be distributed evenly, constrained by the minimum of `a` and `b`. The final return value, `low - 1`, indicates the last value that can be distributed based on the conditions checked by the `can_distribute` function. Note that the function assumes the existence of `can_distribute`, and potential edge cases involve scenarios where `a` or `b` is zero or very small, as well as cases where the distribution may not be possible at all. The function does not handle instances where `can_distribute` is either undefined or always returns False, which could lead to logic errors in a real application.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, n is a positive integer representing the number of plates, and x is a positive integer such that a // x + b // x >= n.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the total number of plates that can be formed from the pieces of the first and second cake (a // x + b // x) is greater than or equal to n, indicating the successful distribution of cakes onto the plates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute` accepts a positive integer parameter `x` and checks if the total number of plates that can be formed from the pieces of the first cake (`a // x`) and the second cake (`b // x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, and `n` is a positive integer. The function returns a boolean value: it returns `True` if the total number of plates is sufficient to meet or exceed `n`, indicating successful cake distribution onto plates; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `x` might exceed `a` or `b`, which could lead to additional edge cases that aren't covered in the current logic.
