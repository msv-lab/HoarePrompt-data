The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The conditions for breaking out were `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `(a - x + (b - x) >= x)`, which were evaluated as true.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` and `b` are input integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively; `x` is equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`) - 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
