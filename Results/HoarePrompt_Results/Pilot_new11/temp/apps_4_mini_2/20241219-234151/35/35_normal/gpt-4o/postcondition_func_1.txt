The function `can_distribute` accepts a positive integer parameter `x` and checks if the total number of plates that can be formed from the pieces of the first cake (`a // x`) and the second cake (`b // x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, and `n` is a positive integer. The function returns a boolean value: it returns `True` if the total number of plates is sufficient to meet or exceed `n`, indicating successful cake distribution onto plates; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `x` might exceed `a` or `b`, which could lead to additional edge cases that aren't covered in the current logic.
