According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute again regardless of the current state. Since the loop does not have a terminating condition, it will continue indefinitely. Therefore, there are no adjustments needed to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` and `b` are input integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, both within the range of 1 to 100; `x` is equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`); `x` is decreased by 1.**
