The function checks whether the total number of plates that can be formed from the pieces of the first and second cake, calculated as (a // x + b // x), is greater than or equal to a positive integer `n`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition for successful distribution of cakes onto the plates is satisfied.
