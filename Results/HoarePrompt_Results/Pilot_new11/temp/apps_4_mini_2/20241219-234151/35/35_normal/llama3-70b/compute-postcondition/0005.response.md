Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` and `b` are input integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, both within the range of 1 to 100. `x` is equal to min(`n`, `a`, `b`). If `a` and `b` are both greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of the remaining pieces after taking `x` pieces from both cakes is greater than or equal to `x`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
