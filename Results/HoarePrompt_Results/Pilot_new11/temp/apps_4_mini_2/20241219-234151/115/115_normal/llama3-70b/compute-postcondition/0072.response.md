Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, and `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for positions where at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1. If the length of `ops` is greater than 2500, -1 is printed; otherwise, all pairs `op[0]` and `op[1]` from each tuple in `ops` are printed.***
