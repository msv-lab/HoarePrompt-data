Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `j` is `m - 1`, and `ops` contains the last tuple (i + 1, j + 1). If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, the relevant operation or condition will proceed as designed; otherwise, the else block does not exist and no other actions are specified.***
