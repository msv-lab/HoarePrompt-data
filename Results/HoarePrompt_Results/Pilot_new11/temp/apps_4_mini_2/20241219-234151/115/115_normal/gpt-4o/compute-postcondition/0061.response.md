According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0. The state indicates that `i` is already set to 1 before the loop starts. Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are that `m` must be greater than 0 and `j` should be initialized to 0, as that is the starting index for the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
