Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not account for isolated `1`s in the given matrix `A` that cannot be formed by any valid set of operations. The program only looks for complete `2x2` blocks of `1`s in `A` to mark those areas in `B` but fails to handle cases where `1`s exist in positions that do not form a complete `2x2` block. This lack of checks for isolated `1`s means that it may incorrectly conclude that a transformation is possible when it is not, leading to incorrect outputs such as not returning `-1` when isolated `1`s exist in `A`. Thus, the program is not correct based on the problem description.
