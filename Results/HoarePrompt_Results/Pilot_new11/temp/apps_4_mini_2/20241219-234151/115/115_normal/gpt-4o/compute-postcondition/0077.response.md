According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2. 

State: **`n` is non-negative and at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the elements `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are equal.**
