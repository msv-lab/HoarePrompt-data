According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, because `range(m)` generates a sequence starting from 0 up to `m-1`. Given that `n` is non-negative and at least 2, and `i` is already 2, there are no adjustments needed for these variables to affect the execution of the loop. 

However, `m` must be modified to ensure that at least one iteration occurs, meaning `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. Consequently, we also need to define the state of `j` at the start of the loop.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
State: **`n` is non-negative and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 1, and `j` is 0**
