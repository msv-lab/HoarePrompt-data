The `continue` statement does not change any variable values; it merely skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since `j` is defined as `m - 1`, it will remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `j` is `m - 1`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
