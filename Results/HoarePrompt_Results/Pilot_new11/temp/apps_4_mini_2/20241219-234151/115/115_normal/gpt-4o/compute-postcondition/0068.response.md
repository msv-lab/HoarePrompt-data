According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1, therefore the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 on the next iteration, making `j` equal to 2. Hence, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the values at A[i][j] and B[i][j] are equal.**
