The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple containing the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the list `ops`. The initial values of `i` and `j` are both 0, thus `i + 1` will be 1 and `j + 1` will also be 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

The output state considers the updated list `ops`, which will now contain the tuple `(1, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**
