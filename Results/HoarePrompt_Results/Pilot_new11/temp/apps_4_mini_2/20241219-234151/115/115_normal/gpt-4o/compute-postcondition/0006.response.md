The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list, where `i` is 0 and `j` is 0. Therefore, the values being appended are `1` and `1`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged. The `operations` list, which was initially empty, now contains one entry: `[(1, 1)]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a list of `n` lists each containing `m` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `operations` is now [(1, 1)], `B` is a list containing `n` lists each with `m` integers where `B[i][j] = 1`, `B[i][j + 1] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j] = 1`, `B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**
