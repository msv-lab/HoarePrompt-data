To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze what the program does and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Specification**: The program expects two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a matrix `A` of dimensions `n x m` where each entry is either `0` or `1`.

2. **Transforming Matrix B**: The goal is to initialize a matrix `B` (which is initially filled with `0`s) and then perform operations to turn it into matrix `A`. Each operation allows us to modify a `2x2` submatrix of `B` to `1`s.

3. **Output Requirements**: If it's impossible to turn `B` into `A`, the output should be `-1`. Otherwise, the output should show the number of operations performed and the specific operations needed to transform `B` into `A`.

### Program Analysis
The program goes through the following steps:

1. **Reading Input**: It correctly reads `n` and `m` and the `n x m` matrix `A`.

2. **Operation Collection**:
   - It declares an empty list `ops` to store the operations.
   - It checks for each potential top-left corner of a `2x2` submatrix in `A` (from `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < n-1` and `0 <= j < m-1`):
     - If all four elements of the `2x2` block (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right) are `1`s in `A`, it continues without recording an operation.
     - If at least one of these elements is `1`, it adds the position `(i+1, j+1)` (converting from 0-based to 1-based indexing) to the `ops` list.
     
3. **Output Logic**:
   - If the length of `ops` exceeds `2500`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of operations (`len(ops)`) and the accumulated operations.

### Evaluation of Correctness
The program fails to fulfill the key requirement of assessing whether it is possible to convert `B` into `A`:

- **Missing Logic**: The program only records `ops` based on conditions of the entries in `A`, but it does not check if all `1`s in `A` can actually be formed using the recorded operations. Specifically, after operations are performed, any `1` in `A` that is not at a position part of a previously recorded `2x2` block will remain `0` in `B`, leading to a potential inconsistency with `A`.

- **Incorrect Condition Checks**: Just verifying if at least one of the `2x2` submatrix components is `1` does not guarantee that we can cover all `1`s in `A` without leaving `0` in places where there should be `1`.

### Conclusion
The program does not ensure that it can produce a matrix `B` equal to `A` under the described operations. It could output operations that do not fully cover every `1` in `A`, leading to a situation where transformation is impossible, yet it wouldn't return `-1`.

Hence, based on the analysis, the output for correctness based on the specified problem description is:

Correctness: **False**
