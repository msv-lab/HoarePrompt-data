Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than 1, `A` is unchanged. `B[n - 2][0]` through `B[n - 2][m - 2]` are set to 1, `B[n - 1][0]` through `B[n - 1][m - 2]` are set to 1 if the conditions for all relevant `j` across the range are satisfied; otherwise, they remain unchanged. The `operations` list contains tuples for every `j` where the conditions were satisfied, and `j` is now equal to `m - 1`.**
