According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. The state indicates that `n` is non-negative and `i` is 0, but these values do not influence the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, the condition that needs to be satisfied is that `m` must be greater than 0. Additionally, before the loop starts, `j` must also be set to the initial value of 0, as it is typically the first value in the `range(m)`. 

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
