Correctness: **False**

The program does not consider the scenario where there are `1`s in matrix `A` that cannot be transformed into `1`s in matrix `B`. Specifically, it can fail in cases where the matrix `A` contains isolated `1`s that are not part of any `2x2` submatrix.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 2
1 0
0 0
```

In this case, matrix `A` looks like this:

```
1 0
0 0
```

The program would not be able to generate matrix `B` to match `A`, because there is a `1` at position `(1, 1)` (in 1-based indexing), but it cannot form a `2x2` block to set `B[1][1]` to `1`. The program will return `-1`, which is correct for this case, but the problem arises in cases with matrices of sizes larger than `2x2`.

Another problematic case is for a larger `A` that contains a `1` configuration that cannot be achieved by any combination of `2x2` submatrices, for example:

```
3 3
1 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

In this configuration, the program would try to fill in the `1`s from `A`, but it would eventually notice that it cannot match `(2, 2)` or any other unreachable `1` because there aren't enough `1`s in the other positions of the matrix to create a `2x2` block.

Thus, the program does not account for configurations in matrix `A` where certain `1`s are isolated and cannot be accessed by performing operations on `B`. This shows that the logic within the `func_1` function is insufficient to guarantee that every configuration of `1`s in `A` can indeed be formed in `B`. Consequently, the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.
