Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains tuples, and the values at `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, and `A[2][1]` are all equal to 1, thus allowing the program to continue to the next iteration or code block.***
