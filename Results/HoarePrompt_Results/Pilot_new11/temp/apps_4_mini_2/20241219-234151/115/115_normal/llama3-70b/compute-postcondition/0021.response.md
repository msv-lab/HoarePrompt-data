Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains tuples for each position (i + 1, j + 1) where at least one of the conditions regarding `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is satisfied, and `i` remains 0. If no positions satisfy these conditions, `ops` will be an empty list.**
