Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `j` is `m - 1`, and `ops` contains the last tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, we have continued to the next iteration of the loop or block of code.***
