Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `ops` contains the tuple (1, 1), `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. If `A[0][1]` and `A[1][1]` are both 1, and `A[0][2]` and `A[1][2]` are also both 1, then the specified conditions regarding the elements of `A` are satisfied. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
