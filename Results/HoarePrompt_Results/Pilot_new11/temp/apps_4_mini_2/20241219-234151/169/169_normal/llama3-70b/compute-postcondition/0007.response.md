The value of `plus_count` minus `minus_count` is printed out, which results in the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'. Given that the count of '-' in `s` is less than or equal to the count of '+' in `s`, the result will be non-negative. The original values of `n`, `s`, `minus_count`, and `plus_count` remain the same after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "-" and "+"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`; the count of '-' in `s` is less than or equal to the count of '+' in `s`; and the output value is `plus_count - minus_count`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "-" and "+"; `minus_count` is the count of '-' in `s`; `plus_count` is the count of '+' in `s`; the count of '-' in `s` is less than or equal to the count of '+' in `s`; output value is `plus_count - minus_count`.**
