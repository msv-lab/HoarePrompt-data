`stones` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `stones` is 0, so after the operation `stones += 1`, the new value of `stones` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' or '+', `stones` is 1, and the first character of `s` (denoted as `operation`) is '+'.
