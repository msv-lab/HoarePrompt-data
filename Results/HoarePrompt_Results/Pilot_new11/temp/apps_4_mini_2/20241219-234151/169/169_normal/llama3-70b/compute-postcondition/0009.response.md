The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "-" and "+". The functionality of the function is to process these parameters and produce a result based on the string `s`. 

However, the specific output or processing logic is not described in the provided information. Therefore, the general understanding is that the function will operate based on the contents of the string `s` that is constrained by the integer `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a string s of length n consisting only of "-" and "+" characters.**
