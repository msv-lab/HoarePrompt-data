`stones` is incremented by 1. The value of `stones` is currently unknown, so it becomes `stones + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' or '+'; `stones` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' or '+'; `stones` is incremented by 1.**
