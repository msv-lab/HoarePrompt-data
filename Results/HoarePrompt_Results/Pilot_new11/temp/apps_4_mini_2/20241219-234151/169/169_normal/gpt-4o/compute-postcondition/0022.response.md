The code `print(stones)` outputs the current value of the variable `stones`. Since the original state describes that `stones` is equal to the net effect of all operations in `s`, and `s` only consists of '-' or '+' characters, the value of `stones` has already been calculated prior to this code snippet.

However, since the code does not change any variable and only prints the value of `stones`, the only value that is printed is the current value of `stones`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '-' or '+' characters; `stones` is equal to the net effect of all operations in `s`.**
