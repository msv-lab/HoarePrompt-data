Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly interprets the problem's requirements regarding the operations performed by Vasya. While it correctly calculates the number of stones based on the operations '+' and '-', it fails to account for the necessary initial conditions set by the problem. Particularly, the program does not properly enforce that before each '-' operation there must be at least one stone available, leading to incorrect answers in scenarios where the operations suggest more stones are taken than are present initially.

To highlight a specific case, consider the input:
```
5
----- 
```
In this case, if Vasya has no stones at the beginning, the first '-' operation would be invalid, as it requires at least one stone to be taken. The program, however, would output `0`, which does not represent the minimal possible number of stones, as this scenario is invalid right from the start.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirement that the pile must be non-empty before taking stones, rendering it incorrect for cases where the operations lead to an invalid sequence.
