The value of `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string of `n` characters, where each character is either '-' or '+'. The value of `n` (an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100) remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each character being either '-' or '+'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each character being either '-' or '+'.**
