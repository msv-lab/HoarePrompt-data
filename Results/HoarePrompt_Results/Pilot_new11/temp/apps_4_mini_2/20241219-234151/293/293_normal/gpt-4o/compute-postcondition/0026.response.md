The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `h` and `n`. `h` is an integer that must be between 1 and 50 inclusive, while `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 2^h inclusive. The function does not return a specific output, as there is currently no output specification provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers, `h` and `n`, while validating that `h` is within the range of 1 to 50, and `n` is within the range of 1 to 2 raised to the power of `h`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `h` (an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive) and `n` (an integer between 1 and 2^h inclusive).**
