According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`. Since `h` is a positive integer, the smallest value `n` can take is 1. For the loop to execute, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is 0**
