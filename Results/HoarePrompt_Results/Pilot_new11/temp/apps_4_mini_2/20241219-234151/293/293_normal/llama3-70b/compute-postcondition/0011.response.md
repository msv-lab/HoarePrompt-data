`ans` is assigned the value of `ans + (n // 2)`. The value of `n` must be greater than 2, which means `n // 2` will be a non-negative integer. Since `h` is not directly affected by this operation, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2)`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `ans` is updated to `ans + (n // 2)`**.
