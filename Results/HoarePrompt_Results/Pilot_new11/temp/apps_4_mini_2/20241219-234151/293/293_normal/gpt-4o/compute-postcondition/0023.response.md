Postcondition: ***`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive; `n` is between 1 and `2^h`; `total_leaves` is 2; `visited_count` is 5; `path` must have at least 3 characters; `current_level` is 0; if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is either 7 or 11, while if `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is either 9 or 13. In the else scenario, if `direction` is '0', `current_node` will be either 8 or 12 depending on whether it was previously 3 or 5; if `direction` is not '0', `current_node` will be either 10 or 14 depending on whether it was previously 4 or 6.***
