According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `n` is greater than 1, which allows for the possibility that the loop can execute again. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes at least one more time since `n` is already greater than 1.

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is updated based on the previous value of `n`**
