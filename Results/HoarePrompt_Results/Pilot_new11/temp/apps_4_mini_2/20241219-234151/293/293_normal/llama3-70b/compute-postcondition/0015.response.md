The new value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2 - 1` to its previous value. Given that `h` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50 and `n` is greater than 1, we can determine that `n // 2` will yield a result that is at least 1 when `n` is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is updated to the new value of `ans + n // 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2 - 1`.**
