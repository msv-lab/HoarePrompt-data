The variable `total_leaves` is assigned the value `2 ** h`. The value of `h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, so `total_leaves` will be a power of 2 ranging from `2^1` (which is 2) to `2^50` (which is 1125899906842624). The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still between 1 and `2^h`.

Output State: **`h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive; `n` is between 1 and `2^h`; `total_leaves` is equal to `2 ** h`.**
