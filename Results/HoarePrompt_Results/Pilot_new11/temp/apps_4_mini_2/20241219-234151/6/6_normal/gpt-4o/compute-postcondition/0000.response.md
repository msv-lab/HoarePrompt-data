In this scenario, `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are all integers, with the specific constraints provided (n between 1 and 100, pos between 1 and n, l between 1 and n, r between l and n). The execution of the code `n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())` indicates that these variables will be assigned new integer values based on user input from the standard input, split into separate components.

Since `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` will now hold the specific values input by the user, we cannot determine their exact values without the actual input. However, we know that after this line of code runs, `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` will still be integers, and their individual constraints must still hold.

The output state would reflect that `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` have been updated with new values based on input and retain their integer properties while respecting the constraints that have been given. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, and these variables are updated based on user input.**
