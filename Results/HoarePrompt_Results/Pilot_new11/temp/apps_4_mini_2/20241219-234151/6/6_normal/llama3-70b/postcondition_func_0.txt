The function calculates an integer result based on the parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, representing boundaries and a current position within a range of numbers from 1 to `n`. It determines how far `pos` is from the defined boundaries, incrementing the result (`ans`) accordingly based on whether `pos` lies outside the range defined by `l` and `r`. Specifically, if `pos` is less than `l`, it adds the difference to `ans`. If `pos` is greater than `r`, it also adds the difference to `ans`. Then, it adds the smaller of `pos - 1` or `n - r`, which accounts for the distance to the start or the end of the range, as well as the maximum of `0` or `l - 1`, which ensures the result accounts for positions before `l`. The function ultimately prints out the computed value of `ans`, which summarizes how far the position is from optimal boundaries, including edge cases where the `pos` is at extreme ends or exactly on the boundaries.
