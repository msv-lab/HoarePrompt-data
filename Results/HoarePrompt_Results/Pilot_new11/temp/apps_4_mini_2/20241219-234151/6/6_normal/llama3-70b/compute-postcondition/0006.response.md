`ans` is reassigned with the value of `ans + (pos - r)`. Since the current value of `pos` is greater than `r`, the difference `(pos - r)` is positive, and thus `ans` will be incremented by this positive difference. The states of the other variables remain unchanged and valid based on the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos < l ≤ n; `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `ans` is equal to the initial value of `ans` plus `(pos - r)` whenever `pos` is greater than `r`.**
