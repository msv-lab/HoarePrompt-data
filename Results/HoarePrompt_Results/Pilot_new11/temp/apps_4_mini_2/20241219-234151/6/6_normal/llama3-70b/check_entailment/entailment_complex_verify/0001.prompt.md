You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic as it relates to the problem description and understand whether it addresses all potential edge cases.

### Program Analysis
The code takes four inputs: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, where:
- `n`: total number of tabs
- `pos`: current position of the cursor
- `l` and `r`: the range of tabs that should remain open

The variable `ans` is initially set to zero and is meant to track the total number of seconds Luba has to spend closing the tabs. 

1. If the cursor is to the left of the segment [l, r], the program calculates the time to move the cursor to tab `l` and adds that to `ans`.
2. If the cursor is to the right of the segment [l, r], it calculates the time to move to tab `r` and adds that to `ans`.
3. There’s also a calculation involving the minimum moves required to close tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r`, based on the current cursor position.

### Potential Case Analysis
While analyzing the logic:
- If `pos` is within the range [l, r], no seconds should be counted, as we don't need to move the cursor or close any tabs.
- If `n` is small (like 1 or 2), the logic should still hold because the ranges may only partially overlap.

#### Edge Cases
1. **All tabs closed or open**:
   - Consider the situation where all tabs from 1 to `n` are closed except for both `l` and `r`. The code should adequately handle closing tabs around the current position.
  
2. **Maximum limits on ranges**: 
   - Test for higher values of `n`, checking how well it handles closing and moving tasks without going out of bounds.

3. **Directly adjacent positions**:
   - When `l` and `r` are directly adjacent to `pos`, it should also correctly interpret when only a single tab, either to the left or right, needs closing.

### Example Test Cases
- For input `6 3 2 4`, as described, steps involve moving to tab 2, closing to the left, moving to tab 3, moving to tab 4, and closing to the right, which totals `5` seconds, perfectly correct.
- For input `6 3 1 3`, she can close tabs at positions 4, 5, and 6 in `1` second after moving to tab 3, also matching the expected output.
- For `5 2 1 5`, no action is needed. The expected output is `0`, which matches.

### Finding Correctness
Given that the program correctly accounts for moving and closing tabs as per the problem statement and I could not find a counterexample where the logic fails for the defined input ranges:

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct as it properly accounts for all cases based on the movement and closing strategy outlined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, pos is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, and l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if (pos < l) :
        ans += l - pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `pos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ pos < l ≤ n, `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n; `ans` is equal to `l - pos` whenever `pos` is less than `l`.
    if (pos > r) :
        ans += pos - r
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos < l ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n. If `pos` is greater than `r`, then `ans` is equal to the initial value of `ans` plus `(pos - r)`.
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates an integer result based on the parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`, representing boundaries and a current position within a range of numbers from 1 to `n`. It determines how far `pos` is from the defined boundaries, incrementing the result (`ans`) accordingly based on whether `pos` lies outside the range defined by `l` and `r`. Specifically, if `pos` is less than `l`, it adds the difference to `ans`. If `pos` is greater than `r`, it also adds the difference to `ans`. Then, it adds the smaller of `pos - 1` or `n - r`, which accounts for the distance to the start or the end of the range, as well as the maximum of `0` or `l - 1`, which ensures the result accounts for positions before `l`. The function ultimately prints out the computed value of `ans`, which summarizes how far the position is from optimal boundaries, including edge cases where the `pos` is at extreme ends or exactly on the boundaries.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
