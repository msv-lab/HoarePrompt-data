The value of `move_to_r` is assigned the value of `abs(pos - r)`, where `pos` is between 1 and `n`, `r` is between `l` and `n`, `l` is greater than 1, and `r` is less than `n`. This means `move_to_r` calculates the absolute distance between `pos` and `r`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `l` is greater than 1; `r` is less than `n`; `r` is not equal to `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `l` is greater than 1; `r` is less than `n`; `r` is not equal to `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`.**
