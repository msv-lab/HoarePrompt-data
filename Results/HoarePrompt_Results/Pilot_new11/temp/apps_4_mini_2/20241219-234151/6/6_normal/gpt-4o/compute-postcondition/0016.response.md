Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer equal to 1; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. If `l` is 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the output is 0. If `l` equals 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. If `l` is greater than 1 and `r` is less than `n`, the values `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, and the value `close_both_sides` equals `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)` have been printed.***
