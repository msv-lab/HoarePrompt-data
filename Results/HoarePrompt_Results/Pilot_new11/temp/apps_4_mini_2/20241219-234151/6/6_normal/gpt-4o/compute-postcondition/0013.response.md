The code snippet is a `print` statement, which outputs the value of `close_both_sides`. No variables are modified by this action; instead, it simply produces an output based on the computation done prior to this point using the variables as defined in the initial state. The other variables retain their previous values after this execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `l` is greater than 1; `r` is less than `n`; `r` is not equal to `n`; `move_to_l` is equal to `abs(pos - l)`; `move_to_r` is equal to `abs(pos - r)`; `close_both_sides` is equal to `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))` and the value of `close_both_sides` has been printed.**
