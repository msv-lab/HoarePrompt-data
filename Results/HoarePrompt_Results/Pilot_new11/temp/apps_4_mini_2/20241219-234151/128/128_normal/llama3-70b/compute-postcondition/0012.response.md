The `days` list is sorted based on the difference `l - k` for each tuple `(k, l)` in descending order. The previous values of `days` consist of `n` tuples, and since `n` is in the range from 1 to 100000, the output state must reflect that `days` is now sorted while maintaining its structure as a list of tuples of integers. 

Output State: **`days` is a list of `n` tuples of input integers sorted by the difference `l - k` in descending order.**
