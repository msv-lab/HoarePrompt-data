According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, and since `n` is defined to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, it guarantees that the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. As the loop iterates, the loop variable `_` will take integer values from 0 to n-1.

At the start of the last iteration, `days` is an empty list, which doesn't influence the execution of the loop itself but may be relevant within the loop body. Before the loop starts, the state you provided ensures that `n` satisfies its constraints.

Therefore, the states that need to be indicated for the loop to execute properly at the beginning are that `n` is within the defined range, and the loop will execute with `_` starting from 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `_` is 0**
