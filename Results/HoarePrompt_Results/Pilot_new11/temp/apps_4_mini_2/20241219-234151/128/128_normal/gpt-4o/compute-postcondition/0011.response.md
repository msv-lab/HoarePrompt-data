After analyzing the provided loop code and considering how the variables change during execution, here is the final output state:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples; `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum values of `k_i` and `l_i` for each tuple in `days`; `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the increments calculated as `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple in `days`.**
