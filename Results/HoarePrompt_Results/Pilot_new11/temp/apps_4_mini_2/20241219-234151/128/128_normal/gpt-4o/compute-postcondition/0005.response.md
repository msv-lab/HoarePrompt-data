According to the code, the loop iterates over the `days` list, which contains at least one tuple. Each tuple has two elements, `k` and `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the first element of the first tuple, `l` is the second element of the first tuple, and `days` contains at least one tuple. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we must account for the fact that iterating through the `days` list increases the index to the next tuple. Therefore, after the current iteration, we need to define what the next state should be considering the next tuple in the `days` list.

Since we know there is at least one tuple in `days`, at the next iteration we would be looking at the next entry in `days`. Consequently, `k` and `l` would need to take on the values of the next tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `k` is the first element of the second tuple in `days`, `l` is the second element of the second tuple in `days`, and `potential_sales_increase` includes the value min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l).**
