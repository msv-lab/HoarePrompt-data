#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), f is a non-negative integer representing the number of days to choose for sell-out (0 ≤ f ≤ n), and days is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i (0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of products and the number of clients on each of the n days, respectively.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer, `days` is a list of tuples containing `n` tuples; `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum values of `k_i` and `l_i` for each tuple in `days`; `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the increments calculated as `min(2 * k_i, l_i) - min(k_i, l_i)` for each tuple in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which is the previous total_sales plus the sum of the top f elements from potential_sales_increase.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of days, a non-negative integer `f` representing the number of days to choose for sell-out, and a list `days` containing `n` tuples of two non-negative integers—`k_i` (the number of products available) and `l_i` (the number of clients on each day). The function calculates the total sales by first determining the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each day to compute regular sales. It then calculates the potential sales increase for each day as the difference between twice the available products and regular sales, only considering valid cases. After summarizing the regular sales, the function sorts the potential sales increases and adds the top `f` values to the total sales. The final output is the total sales amount, which includes the base sales plus the additional sales from the chosen potential increases. Therefore, the function ensures that it maintains accurate handling of possible edge cases, such as when `f` is zero (resulting in no additional sales) or when `n` is at its bounds. Overall, it computes and returns the potentially increased sales amount based on the input conditions.
