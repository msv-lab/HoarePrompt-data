Output State: **`days` is a list of `n` tuples sorted by the difference `l - k`, `sold` is equal to the total calculated based on the given conditions for all `n` elements in the list. If `f` is less than `n`, the first `f` tuples will contribute double their first element to `sold` if `days[i][0] * 2` is less than `days[i][1]`, otherwise the second element will contribute; for the remaining tuples, `sold` will contribute their first element unless `days[i][1]` is less. If `n` is 0, `sold` will remain 0.**
