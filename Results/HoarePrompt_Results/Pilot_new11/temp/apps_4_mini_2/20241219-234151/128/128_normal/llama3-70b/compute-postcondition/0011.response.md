Given the information provided:

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `f` is an integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n, `days` is an empty list.

The loop executes `n` times while reading input values for `k` and `l`, appending them as tuples to the `days` list. Therefore, after the loop has completed execution:

- The total number of iterations will be equal to `n`.
- Each iteration reads a pair of integers (`k`, `l`) which are appended to the `days` list.

After all iterations of the loop have finished:

Output State: **`days` is a list containing `n` tuples of input integers (k, l) where `k` and `l` are input integers; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000.**
