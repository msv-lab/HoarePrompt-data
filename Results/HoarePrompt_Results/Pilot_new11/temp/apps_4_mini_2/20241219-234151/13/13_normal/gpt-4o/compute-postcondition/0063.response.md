The code assigns the first and second elements of the tuple at index `i` from `segments` to `curr_start` and `curr_end`, respectively. Given that `i` is 3, `curr_start` now takes the value of the first element of the tuple at `segments[3]`, and `curr_end` takes the value of the second element of the same tuple. The previous values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` are overwritten, but other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 3; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` is now the first element of the third tuple in `segments`; `prev_end` is now the second element of the third tuple in `segments`; `curr_start` is now the first element of the tuple at index 3 in `segments`; `curr_end` is now the second element of the tuple at index 3 in `segments`.**
