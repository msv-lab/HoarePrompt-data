Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 3 and `j` is 1. If the character at index `j` is 'G', the variable `beauty` is updated to either 3 or 2, depending on its previous value. Otherwise, `beauty` is updated to 2 or remains 1 if the character at index `j` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
