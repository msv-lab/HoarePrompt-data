You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided Python program meets the requirements of the given problem description, we will analyze the logic of the code, the implementation details, and potential edge cases.

The problem requires calculating the maximum length of a contiguous segment of golden trophies ('G') that can be formed after making at most one swap between two trophies. 

Here's a breakdown of the program logic:

1. The code reads inputs for the number of trophies and the arrangement of trophies.
2. It identifies segments of golden trophies by looping through the string and recording their start and end positions in the `segments` list.
3. If there are no golden trophies, it returns `0`.
4. It calculates the longest segment of 'G's already present and checks if it can be increased by considering two non-adjacent segments of 'G's that have one 'S' in between, allowing for a swap.
5. The calculation involves checking if the gap between segments is exactly 2 to allow for a valid swap.

**Examining Edge Cases:**
1. When the input only contains 'S' trophies (e.g., "SSSS"), the expected output is `0`, and the function correctly returns `0`.
2. When there is a single segment of 'G's (e.g., "GGGG"), the function should return `4`, which is handled correctly.
3. When `n` trophies consist mainly of 'G's with 'S's making them non-contiguous (e.g., `GSGSG`), we might expect it to correctly identify that the max length can be increased by swapping.

**Potential Failure Cases:**
Consider the input `5` and `GSSGS`. The expected maximum length is `3` after swapping the 'S' trophies, but the program does not check all potential segment combinations and their distances to allow for optimal swaps. In this case, the program may not return the correct result when adjacent 'S's are present.

**Conclusion:**
In the previous analysis, I discovered that the program does not accurately account for every possible scenario where a swap could be beneficial. Specifically, the handling of segments may incorrectly prevent certain swaps that could yield longer contiguous segments.

Thus, based on my examination, I conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n`, which represents the length of a string `trophies` containing characters 'G' and 'S'. It identifies all contiguous segments of 'G' characters in the string. If no 'G' segments are found, it returns 0. If there is at least one segment of 'G', it calculates the maximum length of these segments. If there is only one segment, it returns its length. If there are multiple segments, it checks for valid gaps (exactly one 'S') between segments of 'G' and may extend the maximum found segment length by including these gaps. Finally, it returns the minimum value between the maximum length found plus one (to account for a potential additional contiguous character) and `n`. This function effectively examines the structure of 'G' characters within the string and assesses how they can be combined, handling cases of no segments, a single segment, and multiple segments with gaps correctly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
