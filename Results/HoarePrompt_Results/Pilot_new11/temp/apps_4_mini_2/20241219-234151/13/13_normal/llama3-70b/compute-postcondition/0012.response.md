According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. The conditions for the loop to execute are that `left` must be less than `right` and the character at index `left` in string `s` must not be 'G'. 

Right before the loop, we have that `right` is 0 and `left` is also 0. Since for the loop to execute the condition `left < right` must be true, and currently `left` is equal to `right`, this condition is not satisfied. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `left` is less than `right`.

Since `right` is already 0, we cannot adjust `left` to a negative value. Therefore, we must increase `right`. To satisfy `left < right`, we could adjust `right` to at least 1. 

Thus, we need to modify `right` to be greater than `left`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S', `right` must be greater than 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'.**
