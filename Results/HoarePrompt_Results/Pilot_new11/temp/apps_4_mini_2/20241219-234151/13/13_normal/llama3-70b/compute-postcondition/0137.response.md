According to the code, the for loop executes in reverse, starting from `i - 1`, which in this instance is `n - 2`, down to `0`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to decrease by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 3`. Therefore, to execute again, `j` becomes `n - 4`. 

The other pertinent states are `n`, which remains unchanged, and the character at index `j` of string `s`, which will be accessed using `j` as `n - 4`. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` remains as it is since it is a constant range between 2 and 100000.
- `j` must subtract 1, so it becomes `n - 4`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 4`, and if the character at index `j` of string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is either 2 or 3 depending on the previous value of `beauty`. Otherwise, `beauty` can be either 1 or 2 depending on the character at index `j` of string `s`, and the program may continue the execution.**
