The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. Since `beauty` is previously defined as the number of consecutive 'G's before index `i` plus 1, the updated state reflects that `beauty` is now one greater than its prior value.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state acknowledges the new value of `beauty` while retaining the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n-2`, `s` contains a number of 'G's before index `i`, `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's before index `i` plus 2, and the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G'.**
