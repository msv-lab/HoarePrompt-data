Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `segments` contains more than one tuple; `prev_start` is the first element of the second tuple in `segments`; `prev_end` is the second element of the second tuple in `segments`; `curr_start` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `segments`; `curr_end` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `segments`; if `curr_start` - `prev_end` == 2, then `max_length` is updated to max(`max_length`, `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
