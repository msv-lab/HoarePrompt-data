Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n`. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, and the loop cannot execute again since `right` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `left` is at the position of 'G' or at a position where `left` is no longer less than `right`. `right` remains unchanged, `max_beauty` is updated to max(`max_beauty`, 0), and if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is set to 1.***
