To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions presented. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`, which means the loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, implying that `n` must be at least 2.

Given the provided state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.
- The variable `i` will start at 0 and increase by 1 until it reaches n - 2 (meaning the last value of `i` will be `n - 2`).

To summarize:
1. `n` is already within the required bounds (at least 2).
2. `i` will initiate at 0 on the first iteration.

As such, there are no further adjustments needed beyond stating that `i` will begin from 0, and other related states do not affect the loop execution directly based on the information provided.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 0**
