The `max_beauty` variable is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `curr_beauty`. Since the values for `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are unchanged in the initial state, the output state only reflects that `max_beauty` could now potentially have a new value if `curr_beauty` is greater than its previous value. However, `max_beauty` retains its previous value if `curr_beauty` is less than or equal to it.

The values for other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `curr_beauty` is unchanged; `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`; `left` is unchanged; `right` is equal to `n`.**
