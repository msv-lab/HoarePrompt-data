The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `beauty` remains according to the count of consecutive 'G' characters as described, and `s[j]` is not equal to 'G' while we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
