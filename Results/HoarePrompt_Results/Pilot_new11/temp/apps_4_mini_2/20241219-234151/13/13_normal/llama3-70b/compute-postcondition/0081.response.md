The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, and `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. However, the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, only `beauty` is affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is an index such that 0 <= `i` < `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
