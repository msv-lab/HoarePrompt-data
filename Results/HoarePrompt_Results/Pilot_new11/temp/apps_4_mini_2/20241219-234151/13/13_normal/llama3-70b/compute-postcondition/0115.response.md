The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected, and the preconditions remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.
