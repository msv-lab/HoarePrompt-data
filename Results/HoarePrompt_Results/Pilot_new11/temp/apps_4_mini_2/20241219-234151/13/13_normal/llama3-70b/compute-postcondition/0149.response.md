The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` is unknown and all other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n`, and `s[j]` must not lead to breaking the inner loop or condition; `beauty` is increased by 1.
