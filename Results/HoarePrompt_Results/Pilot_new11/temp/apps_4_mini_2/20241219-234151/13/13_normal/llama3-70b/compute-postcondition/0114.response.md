According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `j = i + 2` and continues while `j` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is less than `n - 2`, the value of `j` will be `i + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n - 2`, meaning `j` is equal to `i + 2`. To execute the loop again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so it will now be `i + 3`. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 3**.
