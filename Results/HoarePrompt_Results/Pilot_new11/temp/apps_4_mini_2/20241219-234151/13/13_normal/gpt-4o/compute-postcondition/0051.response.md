The code assigns the values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` to the values from the `segments` list at the index `i - 1`, which is 0 (since `i` is initially 1). The precondition states that `segments` must contain more than one tuple, meaning `segments[0]` is guaranteed to be valid and will contain two values. Therefore, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values from the first tuple in `segments`.

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `segments` contains more than one tuple, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the first tuple from `segments`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, `segments` contains more than one tuple, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values from `segments[0]`.**
