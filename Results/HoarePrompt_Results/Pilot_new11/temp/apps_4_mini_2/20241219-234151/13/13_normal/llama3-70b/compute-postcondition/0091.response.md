According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range such that `0 <= i < n - 2`, which means it can increment to `i + 1` and still be valid for the loop condition on the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, becoming `i + 1` (which will then be `n - 2` if it hasn't reached that yet). Therefore, the new value of `i` must be `n - 2`, and `j` must be updated to be at least `i + 2` and at most `n - 1`, which will make `j` equal to `n - 1`.

The state will adjust such that:
- `i` is now `n - 2`
- `j` will be `n - 1`
- The condition on `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` ought to remain applicable for one more iteration with `s[n - 2]` and `s[n - 1]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n - 1`, and if `s[n - 2]` is 'G' and `s[n - 1]` is 'S', `max_beauty_one_swap` will continue to be updated.**
