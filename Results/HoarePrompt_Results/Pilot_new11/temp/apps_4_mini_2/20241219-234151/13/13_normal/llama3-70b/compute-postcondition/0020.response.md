The impact of the code is that `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify a specific value for `curr_beauty`, but it is known that it starts at 0. Thus, after the increment, `curr_beauty` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`left` is equal to the index of the first 'G' encountered in the string `s` or `right` if no 'G' is found before `right`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `right` is greater than 0; `max_beauty` is 0; `curr_beauty` is 1; the characters at indices `0` to `left - 1` in string `s` are all 'S'; and the current value of `left` is less than `right`.**
