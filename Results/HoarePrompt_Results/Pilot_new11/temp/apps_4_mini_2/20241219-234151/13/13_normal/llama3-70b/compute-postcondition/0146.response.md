The value of the variables does not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `-1` with `j` needing to exceed `n`, and the value of `s[j]` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
