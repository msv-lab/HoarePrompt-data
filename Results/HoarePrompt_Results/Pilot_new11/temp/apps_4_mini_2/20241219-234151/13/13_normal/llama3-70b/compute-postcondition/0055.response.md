The variable `max_beauty_one_swap` is initialized to `0`. This does not affect any of the other variables since its assignment is standalone and doesn't depend on the value of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty`, `left`, or `right`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `max_beauty_one_swap` while retaining all other variables in their original states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'; `golden` contains the indices of all 'G's in `s`; `curr_beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's encountered at the end of the loop iteration; `max_beauty` is updated to max(`max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`); `left` is the index of the first 'G' encountered in `s` or `n` if there are no 'G's; `right` is equal to `n`; `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0.**
