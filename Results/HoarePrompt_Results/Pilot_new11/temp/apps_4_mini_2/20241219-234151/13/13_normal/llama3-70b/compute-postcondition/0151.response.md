Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n`, and `s[j]` must not lead to breaking the inner loop or condition. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the execution leads to breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***
