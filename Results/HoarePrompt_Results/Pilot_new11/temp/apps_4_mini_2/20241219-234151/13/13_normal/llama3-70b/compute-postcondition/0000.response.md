`n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a new integer input that must satisfy the condition `2 <= n <= 100000`. The previous string variable is not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000 (updated from input), and the existing string of length n consists of characters 'G' and 'S'.**
