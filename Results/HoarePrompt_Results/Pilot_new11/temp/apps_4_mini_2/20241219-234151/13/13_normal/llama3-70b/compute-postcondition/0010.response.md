The code assigns `max_beauty` the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. Since both `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are initialized to 0, the value of `max_beauty` remains 0 after the operation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `n`, `s`, `right`, `curr_beauty`, and `left` do not change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, `s` is a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S', `right` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'.**
