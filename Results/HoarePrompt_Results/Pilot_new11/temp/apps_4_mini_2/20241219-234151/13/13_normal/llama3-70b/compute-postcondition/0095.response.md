The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is 1, so after the operation, `beauty` becomes 2. The other variables maintain their states. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` >= 3; `i` is `n - 2`; `j` is `n - 3`; `max_beauty_one_swap` will continue to be updated; `beauty` is 2; the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.**
