Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000. If all characters from `trophies[1]` to `trophies[n-1]` are 'G', then `segments` includes the tuple (start, n - 1). Otherwise, if the first character in `trophies` is 'G', `segments` includes the tuple (start, i - 1); if the first character is 'S', then `segments` is an empty list. Additionally, `i` is set to 2, and the character at index `1` in `trophies` is 'S'; the character at index `i` in `trophies` is also 'S'.***
