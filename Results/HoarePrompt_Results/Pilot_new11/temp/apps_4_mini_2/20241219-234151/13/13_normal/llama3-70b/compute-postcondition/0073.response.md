To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we analyze the context provided:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, indicating the length of the string `s`.
- `i` starts from a value where `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S'. This implies that `i` is at least 0 and at most `n - 2`.
- Initially, `beauty` is set to 1.

The loop iterates backwards from `i - 1` down to index 0 of the string `s`. If it encounters 'G', it increments `beauty`. If it encounters any character that is not 'G', it breaks out of the loop.

1. The minimum state when the loop executes 0 times occurs if `i` is 0, where the character at index `i - 1` does not exist. Hence, in this case, `beauty` would remain 1.

2. If the loop executes at least once, it will increment `beauty` for each consecutive 'G' found before `i`. The number of increments to `beauty` will depend on how many 'G's are before index `i`.

Output states after the loop executes some times are as follows:
- If the loop executes 1 time, `beauty` could be 2 if `s[i - 1]` is 'G'.
- If the loop continues and if `s[j]` at previous indices are 'G', the value of `beauty` will keep incrementing until a character is encountered that is not 'G'.

After all possible iterations:
- `beauty` will be `1 + (count of 'G's before index i)`.

Based on the relationship of the variables after all iterations, we can conclude:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is any index such that 0 <= `i` <= `n-2`, `s` contains a number of 'G's before index `i`, `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's before index `i` plus 1.**
