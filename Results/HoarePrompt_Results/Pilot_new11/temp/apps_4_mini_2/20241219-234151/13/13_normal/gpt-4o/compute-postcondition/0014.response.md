The statement `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0, so after the statement is executed, `i` will be 1. The other variables (`n`, `trophies`, `segments`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `trophies` is a string of length `n` containing only 'G' and 'S'; `segments` is an empty list; `i` is 1; the character at index `i` in `trophies` is 'S'.**
