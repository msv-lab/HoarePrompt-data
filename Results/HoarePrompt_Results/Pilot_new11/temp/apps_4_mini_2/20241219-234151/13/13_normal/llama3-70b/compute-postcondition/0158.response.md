Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `j` equals `n`, `beauty` counts the consecutive 'G' characters starting from index `i + 1` downwards (or 1 if none were found), and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `beauty`.***
