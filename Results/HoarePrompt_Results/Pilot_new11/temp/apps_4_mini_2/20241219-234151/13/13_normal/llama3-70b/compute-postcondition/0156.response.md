Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100000`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G' characters in string `s` starting from index `i + 1` (which is `n`) downwards, if there were any consecutive 'G' characters from that position; if none were found, `beauty` remains equal to the initial count (which defaults to 1).**
