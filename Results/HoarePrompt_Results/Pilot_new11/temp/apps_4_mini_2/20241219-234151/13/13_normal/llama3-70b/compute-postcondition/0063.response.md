The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `i` is 1, the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'S', `beauty` is 1, and at index `j` of string `s`, the character is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
