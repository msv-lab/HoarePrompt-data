The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 integers, `mex` is 2, `num` is the next integer in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
