The value of `mex` is assigned the specific value of 1. This does not impact the values of `n`, `a`, or `arr`, which remain valid as per the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a sorted list of integers derived from input; `mex` is 1.**
