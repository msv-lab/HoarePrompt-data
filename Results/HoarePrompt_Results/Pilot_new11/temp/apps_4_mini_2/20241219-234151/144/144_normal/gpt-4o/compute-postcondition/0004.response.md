According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, `a` must contain at least one positive integer. The loop will execute for each element in `a`, starting from the first element. At the end of the last iteration, `num` will take the value of the last element in the list.

Thus, for the loop to execute properly, we need to confirm that `a` is a list of integers that contains at least one element, and `num` will be equal to the first element in `a` during the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**.
