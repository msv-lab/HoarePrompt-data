According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `arr` must contain at least one element since it is iterated over with the statement `for num in arr`. Given that `arr` is stated to be a sorted list of integers derived from input, we must ensure that this list has at least one integer.

Based on the provided state:
- `n` is a positive integer ensures that the input has integers and can be between 1 and 100000.
- `a` being a list of integers with each satisfying the condition 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9 does not directly affect the execution of the loop.
- `mex` is defined as 1, but it is not relevant for the loop execution condition itself, unless it changes how `arr` is formed.
- The key point is `arr` must not be empty for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to be executable, we need to guarantee that `arr` has at least one integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` must contain at least 1 integer, `mex` is 1.**
