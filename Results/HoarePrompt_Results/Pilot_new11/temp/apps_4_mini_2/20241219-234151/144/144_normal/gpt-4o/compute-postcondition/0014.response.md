To evaluate the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we will analyze the loop's code and its effects based on the initial state provided.

The loop processes each element `num` in the sorted list `a`. The `mex` variable starts at 1 and increments by 1 whenever it finds an element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the current value of `mex`.

Since `a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order, we can determine the final value of `mex` after all iterations:

1. If all integers in the list `a` are less than `mex`, it means none of the conditions within the loop were satisfied, leaving `mex` unchanged at its original value of 1.
2. If during processing of `a`, the integers provide the condition `num >= mex`, then `mex` will increment accordingly whenever this condition is true. Specifically, every integer in list `a` will affect `mex` up to the maximum integer in `a`. The final value of `mex` will be `min(max(a) + 1, n + 1)` because the possible values of `mex` begin at 1 and cannot exceed `n + 1` (as there can be `n` positive integers).

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes will depend on whether all elements of `a` were evaluated against `mex`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in ascending order, with `n` being within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in list `a`, which is in the range 1 to `n + 1`. If all elements of `a` are less than or equal to `n`, then `mex` can reach up to `n + 1`. If the loop does not execute, `mex` remains 1.**
