Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 integers, and `mex` is 2. If `num` is equal to 3, then `mex` is updated to 3. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the loop or if statement is exited without altering the state of the variables. If `num` is less than or equal to `mex`, the program continues without changing the values of `n`, `a`, `arr`, `mex`, or `num`.***
