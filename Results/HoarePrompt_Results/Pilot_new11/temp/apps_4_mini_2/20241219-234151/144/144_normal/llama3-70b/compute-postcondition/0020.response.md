Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 more integers, `mex` is 2, and `num` is the next integer in `arr`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the flow continues without interruption since there is no else part.***
