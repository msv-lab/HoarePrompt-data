The variable `mex` is incremented by 1. Given that `mex` has an initial value of 2, after the operation, `mex` will have the value of 3. The variables `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 integers, and `num` is the next integer in `arr`, with `mex` now being 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `a` is a list of integers, `arr` contains at least 2 integers, `num` is the next integer in `arr`, and `mex` is 3.**
