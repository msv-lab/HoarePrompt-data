The code `print('YES')` outputs a string to the console but does not change any of the variables in the program. All other variables retain their previous values. The variable states remain intact, and no values are modified as a result of executing this code. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `y` is equal to `(n - (new value of x) * a) // b`, `x` is the current value incremented by 1, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
