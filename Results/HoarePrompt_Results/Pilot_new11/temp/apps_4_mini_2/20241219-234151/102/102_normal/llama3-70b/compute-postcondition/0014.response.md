The code `exit()` terminates the program without modifying any variable values. The previous values of the variables remain the same, but no further execution will occur, meaning no output from any subsequent lines or values will be generated. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `y` is equal to `(n - a) // b`, `x` is printed, and 'YES' has been printed; the program has been terminated.**
