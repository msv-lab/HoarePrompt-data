The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which takes an input and converts it to an integer. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The value of `a` can be any integer between 1 and 10,000,000, depending on the user input. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is an input integer between 1 and 10,000,000; `b` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `b` â‰¤ 10,000,000.**
