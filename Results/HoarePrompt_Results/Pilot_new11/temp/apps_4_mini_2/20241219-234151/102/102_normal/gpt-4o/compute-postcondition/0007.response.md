The code outputs the current values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is 0 and `y` is already defined as `n // b`, these values are directly printed. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least equal to `a`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`.

Output State: **`n` is at least equal to `a`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b**
