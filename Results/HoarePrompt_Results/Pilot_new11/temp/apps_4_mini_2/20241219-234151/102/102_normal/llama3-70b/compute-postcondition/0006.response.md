The code snippet simply prints 'YES' to the output, and does not modify any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of the pre-existing variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, and the equation `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, and 'YES' is printed.**
