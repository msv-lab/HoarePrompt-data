Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya can spend exactly `n` burles on bottles of Ber-Cola (costing `a` burles each) and Bars bars (costing `b` burles each). Here's a breakdown of how the program achieves this:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input.

2. **Looping through possible values of x**: The program iterates through potential numbers of bottles of Ber-Cola (`x`) that Vasya might buy, ranging from `0` to the maximum number he can afford (`n // a`).

3. **Checking for validity**: For each value of `x`, the program checks if the remaining money (`n - x * a`) can be exactly spent on Bars bars. This is done by checking if the remaining amount is divisible by `b`.

4. **Finding a solution**: If a valid solution is found, it calculates the corresponding value of `y` (number of Bars bars) and prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`.

5. **No Solution Handling**: If the loop completes without finding a valid combination of `x` and `y`, it prints "NO".

The logic effectively covers all possible combinations of non-negative integers `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `x * a + y * b = n`. 

Since the loop checks all feasible values of `x` in integer steps, and only terminates when it finds a valid combination or exhausts all possibilities, all edge cases (such as when `a` or `b` might be significantly larger than `n` or when `n` is exactly equal to multiples of `a` or `b`) are also accounted for.

Therefore, the program functions correctly for all input values within the specified constraints.
