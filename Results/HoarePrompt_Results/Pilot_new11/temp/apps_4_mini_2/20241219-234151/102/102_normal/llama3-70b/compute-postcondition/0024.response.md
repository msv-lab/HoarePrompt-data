The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates with integer variables `n`, `a`, and `b` that have constraints such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000. The function's output is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot describe the return value of the function.

In summary, the function does not take parameters in the conventional sense; it relies on internal or global variables that fit within the specified integer constraints. Therefore, without further detail on the return value, we cannot delineate the functionality explicitly.

Functionality: **The function operates with integer variables n, a, and b, constrained between 1 and 10,000,000, but does not accept any parameters or specify a return value.**
