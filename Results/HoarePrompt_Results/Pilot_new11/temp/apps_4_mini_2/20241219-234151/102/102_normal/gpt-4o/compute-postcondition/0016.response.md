According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `x` and the result of `n // a + 1`. After the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `n` is at least `a`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `x` will become 2. We also need to check whether the loop can still execute. The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`.

Therefore, if `x` is incremented to 2, then `n // a` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is at least `a`, `x` is 2, and it is not the case that (n - x * a) is divisible by `b` when x is 2**
