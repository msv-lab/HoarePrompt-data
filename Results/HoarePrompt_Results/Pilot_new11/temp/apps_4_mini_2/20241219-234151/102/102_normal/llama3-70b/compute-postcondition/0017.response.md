The variable `y` is reassigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. The previous value of `y` was calculated as `(n - a) // b`. However, given the update, `x` is the current value incremented by 1. Thus, `x` has a new value, increasing its effect on the calculation of `y`.

The new value of `y` is based on the updated value of `x`, therefore:
- `x` is the incremented value based on a previous value.
- `y` now depends on the new value of `x`, along with existing values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Since `x` has increased, the term `x * a` becomes greater than it was before, thereby changing the calculation of `y`.

The Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `y` is equal to `(n - (new value of x) * a) // b`, `x` is the current value incremented by 1.**
