The provided code only executes a print statement and does not change any variable values or states. Therefore, the output state will maintain all previous values of the variables that have not changed. The value 'YES' is printed, but it does not affect the variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least equal to `a`, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, and `(n - 0 * a) % b == 0` holds true; 'YES' has been printed.**
