The code will print the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is defined as 0 and `y` is calculated as `n // b`, the output will contain those values. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b`, and 'YES' is printed; printed values are `0`, `y`.**
