The variable `y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. Given that `x` is initially `0`, the equation simplifies to `y = n // b`. The other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0, and `y` is equal to `n // b`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `n // b**
