The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. All three parameters are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10,000,000. 

The functionality of the function is as follows:
- If `n` is at least equal to `a` and `x` is 0, the function returns the value of `y`, which is calculated as `n // b`.
- If the conditions for Case_1 are not fulfilled, the function returns nothing as there is no specified value to return (Case_2).
- In case none of the specified return conditions are met, the function returns None (Case_3).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, all integers, and returns n // b if n is at least equal to a and x is 0; otherwise, it returns nothing or None.**
