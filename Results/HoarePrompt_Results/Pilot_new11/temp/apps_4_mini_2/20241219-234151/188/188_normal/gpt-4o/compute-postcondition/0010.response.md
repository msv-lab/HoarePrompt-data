Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers from user input; `count` is a Counter object representing counts of integers in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of keys from `count` based on their values. The length of `unique_numbers` is greater than or equal to 2; either `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` is not equal to `n // 2` or `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` is not equal to `n // 2`.***
