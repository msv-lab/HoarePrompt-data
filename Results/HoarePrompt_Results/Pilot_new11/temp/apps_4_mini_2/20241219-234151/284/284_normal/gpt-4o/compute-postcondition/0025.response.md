The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. Based on the value of `x`, the function behaves as follows:

- Case 1: If `x` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False.
- Case 2: If `x` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3, the function returns True.
- Case 3 through Case 6: In these cases, the function returns False, indicating that for certain values of `x` beyond the specified ranges, the output is False.
- Case 7: For certain values of `x`, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `x` within the range of 1 to 1000 and return True for specific small values of `x` (specifically between 2 and 3) and return False otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and returns True if `x` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3; otherwise, it returns False.**
