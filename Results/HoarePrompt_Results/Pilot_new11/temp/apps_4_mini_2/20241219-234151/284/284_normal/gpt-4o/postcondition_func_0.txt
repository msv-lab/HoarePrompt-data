The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000). It returns False if `x` is less than or equal to 1, True if `x` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3, and subsequently checks if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning False if it is. If `x` is greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it further checks if `x` is divisible by any numbers of the form 6k ± 1, starting from 5, up to the square root of `x`. The function returns True if `x` is not divisible by any of these numbers, indicating that `x` is prime. Therefore, the function ultimately determines whether the input integer `x` is prime, returning True if it is prime and False otherwise. The code, however, lacks proper handling for edge cases such as direct input of 1 or 2, which is not accurately described in the annotations.
