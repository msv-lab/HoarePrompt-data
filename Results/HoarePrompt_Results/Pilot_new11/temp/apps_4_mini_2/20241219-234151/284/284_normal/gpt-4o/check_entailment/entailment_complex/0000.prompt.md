You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func_1(x):
    if (x <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, as the current value of x is less than or equal to 1, and the conditions specify that x is a positive integer with a maximum value of 1000.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000, and `x` is greater than 1.
    if (x <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True since the current value of x is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 3.
    if (x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 1000, `x` is greater than 3, and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3.
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x is an integer at least 289 and less than 530, x is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7; i is 29.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000). It returns False if `x` is less than or equal to 1, True if `x` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3, and subsequently checks if `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, returning False if it is. If `x` is greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it further checks if `x` is divisible by any numbers of the form 6k ± 1, starting from 5, up to the square root of `x`. The function returns True if `x` is not divisible by any of these numbers, indicating that `x` is prime. Therefore, the function ultimately determines whether the input integer `x` is prime, returning True if it is prime and False otherwise. The code, however, lacks proper handling for edge cases such as direct input of 1 or 2, which is not accurately described in the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
