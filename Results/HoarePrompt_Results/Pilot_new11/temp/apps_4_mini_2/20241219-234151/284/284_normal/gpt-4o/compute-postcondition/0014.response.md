The value of `i` is incremented by 6, changing its previous value of 5 to 11. The state of `x` remains unchanged, as it is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains the original conditions regarding `x` while reflecting the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 25 and `x` is neither divisible by 2 nor divisible by 3; `i` is 11. Additionally, `x` is not divisible by 5 and is not divisible by 7.**
