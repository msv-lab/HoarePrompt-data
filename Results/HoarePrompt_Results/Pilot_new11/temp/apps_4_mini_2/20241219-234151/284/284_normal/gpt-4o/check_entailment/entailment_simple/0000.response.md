To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given \( n \). The valid range for \( m \) is from 1 to 1000.

### Program Breakdown
1. The program reads an integer \( n \) from input.
2. It enters a loop where it iterates \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
3. Inside this loop, it computes \( n \cdot m + 1 \) and checks if this value is prime using a function `func_1`.
4. If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

### Prime Checking Function (func_1)
The function `func_1` is constructed as follows:
- If \( x \) (which is \( n \cdot m + 1 \)) is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
- For \( x = 2 \) or \( x = 3 \), it returns `True`, as they are prime.
- For composite numbers divisible by 2 and 3, it returns `False` immediately.
- Beyond that, it uses a trial division method with an increment of 6 and checks for factors up to \( \sqrt{x} \).

### Correctness Analysis
- The function correctly identifies non-prime numbers according to the conditions described in the problem.
- The loop explores all values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000, ensuring that it will find at least one \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime before exhausting the range since the problem guarantees a solution exists.
- The output will be an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is guaranteed to be non-prime.

Based on the above analysis, the program satisfies the problem description by effectively identifying a counterexample for any positive integer \( n \) within the given constraints.

### Conclusion
Since the program performs as required and meets the specifications outlined in the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
