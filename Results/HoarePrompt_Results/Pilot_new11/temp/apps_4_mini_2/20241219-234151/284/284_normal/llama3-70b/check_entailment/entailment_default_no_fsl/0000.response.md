Correctness: **False**

The program fails to check for all potential cases where `n * m + 1` is not a prime number. Specifically, it can produce an infinite loop or fail to find a suitable `m` if the function mistakenly categorizes certain values as prime or neglects to efficiently eliminate certain composites.

For example, consider `n = 1`: 
- The program will calculate `n * m + 1` as `1 * m + 1 = m + 1`, which is always even for all `m >= 1` (except for when `m = 1`, where it evaluates to 2, which is prime). 
- The function `func_1(num)` correctly identifies 2 as prime but will identify 4, 6, 8, etc., as non-prime (for even numbers greater than 2); thus, it could potentially find valid outputs, but the program is not guaranteed to handle all cases since it only starts evaluating from `m = 1`.

Moreover, the function `func_1(num)` does work correctly in identifying primes, but there are no checks to distinguish between edge cases where `n * m + 1` is not prime consistently based on the formula provided, especially for larger values of `n` and varying values of `m`.

This logic flaw means there may be values of `m` that are prime under some values of `n`, leading to an inevitable failure to find a counterexample for every case, therefore making the program incorrect.
