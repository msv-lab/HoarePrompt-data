The program is designed to find a value of `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for a given positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). The approach involves iterating over potential values for `m`, computing `n * m + 1`, and checking if the result is prime using the `func_1` function.

Let's analyze the code and see if it meets the problem description correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly takes an integer input `n` and iterates through integers `m` from 1 to 1000. 

2. **Prime Checking Logic**: The function `func_1` effectively checks if a number `x` is prime. It returns:
   - `False` for numbers ≤ 1,
   - `True` for numbers 2 and 3,
   - `False` for multiples of 2 and 3.
   - For numbers greater than 3, it checks divisibility using a method that covers all potential divisors effectively.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates through `m`, calculates `n * m + 1`, and checks its primality. The output `m` is printed as soon as a non-prime result is found.

4. **Output Range**: The problem states that any valid `m` must satisfy `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000`, which the loop respects.

Reviewing the output hints regarding the function's behavior confirms that it correctly identifies non-prime numbers based on the criteria set out in the problem description.

However, it is crucial to note that while the method does return a valid `m` based on the problem description, the explanation of the `func_1` function lacks detail about how it approaches determining if a number is prime, specifically that it checks numbers in the form of `6k ± 1`, which makes it efficient. 

Yet, despite this minor deficiency in the explanation, there are no cases where the function fails to produce a valid output according to the problem description. Since the output guarantees that at least one such non-prime will be found and given the solid design of the primality testing function, the arguments align that the program effectively fulfills its requirements.

Given all of this information, the conclusion is as follows:

Correctness: **True**.
