Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length at least 3, and `color` is the third character of `s`. If `color` exists in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` does not exist in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is set to 1.***
