You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if max_color_count <= k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of unique balloon colors is less than or equal to the number of friends, but one or more colors have counts that exceed the number of friends available. For example, consider the input:

```
5 2
aaaab
```

In this case, there are 5 balloons, of which 4 are of color 'a'. Kefa has 2 friends. The maximum color count is 4, which is greater than the number of friends (2). Therefore, it's impossible to distribute the balloons without upsetting a friend because one friend would have to take at least two 'a' balloons. Thus, the correct output should be "NO". However, the program will output "NO", which is correct in this example.

However, if we consider this case:

- Input:
```
4 2
abcd
```
In this case, Kefa has 4 balloons of 4 different colors and 2 friends. The program would output "YES" because max_color_count (1 for each color) is less than or equal to k (2). But, although every friend could get 2 of the different colors, if there were additional balloons or constraints not mentioned in the problem description, for specific distributions such that all cases of 'upsetting' friends are working, we could assume that even this could become ambiguous if you had to take residual cases in the future. 

Therefore, the output should have handled the above inconsistently too.

Thus, the program fails to verify conditions comprehensively and can give a misleading allowance to have more than 2 balloons. Even though I cannot find a clear output on the correct assignment based on this example (beyond just input distributions), it remains critical.

The logic needs to ensure it checks if the max color count fits the friends’ distribution effectively, getting the final "YES" or "NO" accurately. 

So the handling for distributions even under straightforward balloon thresholds isn’t there in verification correctness. 

Thus, based on my assessment, the situation could have been managed better through constraints from the starting point on how friends interact per color distributioning. Hence, by the problem statement requirements specifically avoiding upset conditions, the check is ineffective per potential distributions. 

In conclusion, the program does not handle all cases and potential distributions correctly, which confirms the logic behind the assessment.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers, n and k, followed by a string s of length n, which represents colors of balloons. It counts the occurrences of each unique color in the string using a dictionary. After processing, it determines the maximum count of any balloon color. If this maximum count is less than or equal to k, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Note that if the string s is empty (although this case beyond given constraints of n ≥ 1), the function would still execute, leading to a potential problem when trying to retrieve the maximum value from the empty dictionary, resulting in a runtime error. Thus, while the function aims to check balloon color constraints against k, it lacks handling for cases where the input string might not meet the expected length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
