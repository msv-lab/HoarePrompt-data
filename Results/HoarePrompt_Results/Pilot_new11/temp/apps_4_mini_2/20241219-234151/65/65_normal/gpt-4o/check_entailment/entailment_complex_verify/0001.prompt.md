You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic based on the problem description.

The problem states that Kefa has `n` balloons of certain colors represented by a string `s`, and he has `k` friends. No friend can receive two balloons of the same color. The goal is to check if it is possible to distribute all balloons without upsetting any friends.

Key requirements:
- Each friend's balloon must be a unique color.
- Each friend can take only one balloon of each color.
- If a color appears more than `k` times, it can't be distributed because at least one friend would receive multiple balloons of that color.

The program works as follows:
1. It reads the inputs for the number of balloons `n` and the number of friends `k`.
2. It constructs a dictionary `color_count` to count the occurrences of each color in the string `s`.
3. It then checks if any color count exceeds `k`. If any count exceeds `k`, it sets `can_distribute` to `False` and breaks the loop.
4. Finally, it prints "YES" if `can_distribute` remained `True` and "NO" otherwise.

Now let's look at the critical edge cases:
- If there are more friends `k` than the number of different balloon colors given, it should still be possible to distribute the balloons as each friend can take a unique color.
- If `n` is greater than `k` but the colors can be distributed uniquely to friends, it should still return "YES".
- Conversely, if one color appears more than `k` times, it should return "NO".

### Testing Edge Cases

Consider this input:
```
Input
10 3
aaaabbbbcc
```
In this case:
- Color 'a' appears 4 times.
- Color 'b' appears 4 times.
- Color 'c' appears 2 times.

As there are two colors ('a' and 'b') with counts exceeding `k` (3), the expected output should be "NO". 

However, analyzing the code:
- The program would detect that for both 'a' and 'b', their counts exceed `k`, thus it would output "NO".

Now, let's consider one more scenario:
```
Input
5 1
abcde
```
Here:
- There are 5 different colors.
- Given `k = 1`, each color can be given to the single friend without repetition.
- The program would correctly identify that each color is used once and output "YES".

### Conclusion
The script correctly identifies the distribution problem based on the inputs provided and handles edge cases appropriately. It checks properly if any color surpasses the available distinct friends, which directly impacts whether the distribution is possible.

Since there are no identified cases where the program does not perform as expected according to the problem statement:

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of balloons, k is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s`, and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that character in `s`.
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, `color_count` is a dictionary with character counts, and `can_distribute` is False if any character count in `color_count` exceeds `k`, otherwise it is True.
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `color_count` is a dictionary with character counts. If `can_distribute` is True, it indicates that no character count in `color_count` exceeds `k`, allowing for distribution. If `can_distribute` is False, the output is 'NO' due to at least one character count exceeding `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines if a given number of balloons in various colors can be distributed among a specific number of friends, such that no friend receives more than one balloon of the same color. It accepts two positive integers `n` (the number of balloons) and `k` (the number of friends), as well as a string `s` (representing the colors of the balloons). If any color appears more frequently than `k`, it prints 'NO', indicating that fair distribution is not possible. If all colors have a count less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', meaning the balloons can be distributed without exceeding the limit for any friend. Note that the function does not explicitly handle invalid inputs or cases where `n` or `k` are less than or equal to zero, which could lead to erroneous behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
