Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5; `p` is a list representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of zeros and ones with length `n`. If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then if `b[i]` is 0, `ans` is updated to 4 (changed from 3). If `b[i]` is 1, `ans` is updated to 3 (changed from 2); `i` must be equal to the previous value plus 1 (i + 1).***
