According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the integer `n`, which specifies the number of iterations. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to 0, as the first iteration starts with the index 0.

So, for the loop to execute correctly, we need to have `i` start at 0 and `n` must be a positive integer. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**
