The code initializes a list called `visited` with `n` elements, all set to `False`. The initial state of `n`, `b`, `data`, and `p` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `visited`, which is a list of `n` `False` values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `b` is a list of integers created from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`; `data` is a list of substrings resulting from splitting the input string; `p` is a list of integers composed of `int(data[1])`, `int(data[2])`, ..., `int(data[n])`; `visited` is a list of `n` False values.**
