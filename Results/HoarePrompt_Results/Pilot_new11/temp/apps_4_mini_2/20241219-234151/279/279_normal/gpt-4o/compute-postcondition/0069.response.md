The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `p` and `b`. The parameter `n` is implicitly given as the length of the list `p`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5. The list `p` is a valid permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`, and the list `b` consists of integers that are either zeros or ones, with the same length as `p`. The output of the function is not explicitly stated, but based on the parameter relationships, it likely processes the permutation and the binary list in some manner and returns an integer or a list derived from these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `p` representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n and a list `b` of zeros and ones. It processes these lists and returns a result based on their content and relationships.**
