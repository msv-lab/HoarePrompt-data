According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. Since `i` is incremented by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to 1, and there must still be the condition that `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
