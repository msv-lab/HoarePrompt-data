Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers of zeros and ones with length `n`, `ans` is 2, and `i` is 0. If `b[i]` is 0, then the current value of `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1 and `ans` is set to 2.***
