The code assigns the value `True` to `visited[x]`. However, `visited[x]` was already set to `True` based on the initial state. Therefore, the value of `visited[x]` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` is a list containing two occurrences of the updated `x`, `visited[1]` is True, `visited[x]` is True and `visited[x]` remains True.**
