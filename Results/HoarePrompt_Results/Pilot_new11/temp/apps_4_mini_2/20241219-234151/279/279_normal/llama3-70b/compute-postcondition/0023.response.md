The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer that satisfies the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It also accepts a parameter `p`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a parameter `b`, which is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length equal to `n`. 

The function does not directly return values based on specific conditions mentioned in the output, but rather, it processes the inputs in relation to one another to derive its final output.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n`, a list `p` that is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of zeros and ones, and to perform operations on these inputs in order to return a computed result based on the logic implemented within the function. However, the specific return value or logic applied to these inputs is not described in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n, a list p representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a list b consisting of zeros and ones, performing operations based on these inputs.**
