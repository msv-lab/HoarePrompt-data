According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `visited[x]`. If `visited[x]` is `False`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `visited[x]` is `True`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state of `visited[x]` must be adjusted to `False`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `cycle` is [2, p[x] - 1]; `visited[x]` must be False**
