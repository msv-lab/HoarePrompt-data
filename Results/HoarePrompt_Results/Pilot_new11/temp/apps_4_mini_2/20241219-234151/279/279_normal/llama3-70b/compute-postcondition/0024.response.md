Functionality: **The function takes three inputs: an integer n, a list p that is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a list b consisting only of zeros and ones, all with a length of n. It computes a value `ans` which is the sum of two counts: the number of elements in list p that are not in their correct positions (where the correct position for an integer x is index x-1) and the count of indices in list b that contain the value 0. After processing, the function prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any value directly; it only prints the result to the standard output. The function does not handle any errors related to input size or input format.**
