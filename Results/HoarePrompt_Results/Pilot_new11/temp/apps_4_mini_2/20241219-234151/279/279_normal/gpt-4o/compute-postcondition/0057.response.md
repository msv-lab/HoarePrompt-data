The code snippet `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. There are no previous values of `x` provided, but since `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, and `i` is 2, we understand that `x` must be defined within the context of the code being executed. However, in the initial state, the current value of `x` is not provided, thus limiting our specificity. The variable `cycle` is updated to include `x`, but all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `cycle` is [2, p[x] - 1, x]; `visited[x]` is True**
