The code sets the value of `visited[x]` to `True`. Prior to this, it is specified that `visited[1]` must be `False`, thus indicating that `x` is likely equal to `1`. Therefore, `visited[1]` will now become `True`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `i`, and `cycle`, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `cycle` is an empty list, visited[1] is True**
