The operation `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` (which is 2) to the list `cycle`. The previous state indicates that `cycle` is an empty list, so after the execution, `cycle` will contain the single value `[2]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cycle` is [2], `x` is 2, `visited[2]` is True**
