Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It simulates the weight growth of Limak and Bob over the years as follows:

1. It reads two integers, `a` (Limak's weight) and `b` (Bob's weight), ensuring that initially `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`.

2. The program utilizes a `while` loop to repeatedly multiply Limak's weight by 3 and Bob's weight by 2 for each year until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight. The loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the program continues to run until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight.

3. A counter variable `years` is incremented in each iteration of the loop to keep track of the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

4. When the loop concludes, it prints the total number of years required for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight.

The logic is straightforward, and the program fulfills the requirement that Limak must become strictly heavier than Bob, not just equal to him, which aligns with the problem requirements. Thus, since all cases are handled correctly in accordance with the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.
