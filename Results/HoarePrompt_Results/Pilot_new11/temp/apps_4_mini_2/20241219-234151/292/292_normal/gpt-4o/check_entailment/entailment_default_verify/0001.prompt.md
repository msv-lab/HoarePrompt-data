You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where Limak's and Bob's weights are initially equal. For the input (1, 1), Limak's weight becomes 3 and Bob's weight becomes 2 after one year, and the program outputs 1, which is misleading because it suggests Limak became strictly larger after one year. The problem asks for Limak to be strictly larger than Bob, meaning it should return 0 years for the input (1, 1) since Limak should already be considered strictly larger at the start.

Therefore, the program fails to handle the case correctly where both Limak and Bob have the same weight initially. It doesn't account for the possibility that Limak should not count any years if he is already equal and only needs to become strictly larger.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integers, `a` and `b`, representing Limak's weight and Bob's weight, respectively, with a condition that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10. It repeatedly increases Limak's weight (`a`) by multiplying it by 3 and Bob's weight (`b`) by multiplying it by 2 until Limak's weight becomes greater than Bob's weight. The function counts the number of years (iterations) it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight. At the end of execution, it returns the count of years via a print statement. Notably, initial checks ensure a proper range for `a` and `b`, and the function does not handle cases where inputs are out of range or equal, falling strictly in the range defined. If the inputs do not adhere to the imposed conditions, the function's behavior is undefined. The output is the number of years it took for Limak to outweigh Bob as calculated by the loop.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
