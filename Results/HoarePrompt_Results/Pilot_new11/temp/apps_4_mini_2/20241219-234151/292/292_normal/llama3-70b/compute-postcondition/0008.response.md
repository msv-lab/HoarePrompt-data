The variable `b` is multiplied by 2. The initial value of `b` is an input integer that lies within the range `6 ≤ b ≤ 20`. Therefore, after the multiplication, `b` will range from `12` to `40` (i.e., `2 * b` where `b` is in `[6, 20]`). The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is now `3 * a`, `b` is an input integer such that `12 ≤ b ≤ 40`, `years` is 1**
