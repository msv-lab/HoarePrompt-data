The value of `years` is incremented by 1. Since `years` was initially 1, after the execution of the code, the value of `years` becomes 2. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a value between 3 and 90, `b` is at least `2 * a`, `years` is now 2.

Output State: **`a` is a value between 3 and 90, `b` is at least `2 * a`, `years` is 2**
