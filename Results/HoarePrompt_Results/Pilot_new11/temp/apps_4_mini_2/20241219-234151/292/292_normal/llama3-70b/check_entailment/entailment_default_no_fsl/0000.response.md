Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly simulates the weight growth of Limak and Bob based on the conditions given in the problem description. It ensures that Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year, counting the number of years until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's. 

Given the inputs constrained by \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\) and the output assessment through the `while` loop, the program will handle all possible combinations of weights within the specified range. 

The examples provided in the problem statement align with the program's output, and it correctly accounts for edge cases such as when Limak and Bob start at equal weights. Therefore, the program effectively meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all valid input cases.
