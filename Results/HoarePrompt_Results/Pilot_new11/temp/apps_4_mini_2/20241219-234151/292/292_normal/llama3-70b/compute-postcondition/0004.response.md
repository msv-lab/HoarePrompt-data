The variable `b` is multiplied by 2. The value of `b` was an input integer satisfying the condition `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, which means that `b` could originally be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 based on the initial state. Hence, after `b` is multiplied by 2, its new value will range from 6 to 20, depending on its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `3 * a`, `b` is an input integer such that `6 ≤ b ≤ 20`, `years` is 0**
