The variable `years` is assigned the value of `0`. The values of the other variables (`a` and `b`) remain unaffected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10; `b` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10; `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10; `b` is an input integer satisfying 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `b` ≤ 10; `years` is 0**.
