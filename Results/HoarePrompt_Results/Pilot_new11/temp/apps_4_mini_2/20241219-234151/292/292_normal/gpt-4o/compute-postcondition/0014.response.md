To determine the output state after the while loop executes completely, let's analyze the loop and derive its behavior based on the given initial constraints.

1. The loop starts with `a` being an input integer in the range [1, 10], and `b` also in the range [1, 10]. The variable `years` starts at 0.
2. The loop continues while `a` is less than or equal to `b`. During each iteration of the loop:
   - `a` is multiplied by 3.
   - `b` is multiplied by 2.
   - `years` is incremented by 1.

Now let's consider the output state:

- After the first iteration:  
  We have `a` becomes `3 * a` (which can be between 3 and 30), and `b` becomes `2 * b` (which can be between 2 and 20). Hence, `years` is incremented to 1.
  
- After the second iteration:  
  Now `a` becomes `3 * (3 * a) = 9 * a` (which is between 9 and 90) and `b` becomes `2 * (2 * b) = 4 * b` (which will still be greater than `a` as observed in the constraints). Thus `years` becomes 2.

- After the third iteration:  
  Here, `a` becomes `3 * (9 * a) = 27 * a` (which is between 27 and 270) and `b` becomes `2 * (4 * b) = 8 * b` (still greater than or equal to `a`). Now `years` is updated to 3.

- If the loop executes a fourth time, `a` will be `81 * a` (between 81 and 810), and `b` will be `16 * b` (which likely would be greater than `a`). However, since we are capped at 10 initially for `a`, it indicates that the loop could not run indefinitely.

From this reasoning, we see that the loop will continue executing until `a` exceeds `b`. Given the loop's operations, ultimately the loop ends when `a` becomes greater than `b`. 

Now, letâ€™s determine the final state:

- Since `a` is multiplied by 3 and `b` by 2 each iteration, once `a` exceeds `b`, the loop stops. 
- Eventually, the possible end state must show `a` exceeding its maximum input value multiplied suitably, and `b` will have also increased but not out of proportion to `a` beyond the initial limits.

Thus, considering all the iterations with their respective outputs and constraints, we arrive at:

Output State: **`a` is greater than `b`, `years` is the number of times the loop executed until `a` exceeded `b` (which could be 3 or even 4 if `a` was close to `b` initially),  `b` is greater than or equal to its initial value and still positive.**
