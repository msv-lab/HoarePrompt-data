The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. Prior to this operation, `b` must be at least `3 * a`, and since `a` is defined as `3 * (3 * a)`, `b` will be at least `3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * a)))` or simply `9 * a`. Therefore, after the operation, `b` will now be `2 * b`, which can be expressed as `2 * (at least 3 * a)`. The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is now `3 * (3 * a)`, `b` is at least `6 * a`, `years` is 2**
