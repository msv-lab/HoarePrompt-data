The variable `b` is assigned the value `b * 2`, which means `b` will become twice its original value. Given that `b` is at least `2 * a` and will still remain greater than or equal to `a`, the condition for the loop to execute one more time holds true. 

Before the code execution, `b` is guaranteed to be at least `2 * a`, which means `b >= 2 * 9 = 18` (the minimum of `a`) and `b >= 2 * 270 = 540` (the maximum of `a`). After the execution of `b *= 2`, `b` will be at least `18 * 2 = 36` or up to `540 * 2 = 1080`.

Overall, the output state is: `a` is between `9` and `270`; `b` is at least `2 * a * 2`, hence `b` is between `36` and `1080`.

Output State: **`a` is between `9` and `270`; `b` is at least `36` and still greater than or equal to `a`.**
