The value of `b` is doubled. Since `b` is an input integer that must be at least equal to the previous value of `a`, and it satisfies `2 â‰¤ b`, the value of `b` after the operation will be at least `2 * a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a value between 3 and 90, `b` is at least `2 * a`, `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is a value between 3 and 90, `b` is at least `2 * a`, `years` is 1**
