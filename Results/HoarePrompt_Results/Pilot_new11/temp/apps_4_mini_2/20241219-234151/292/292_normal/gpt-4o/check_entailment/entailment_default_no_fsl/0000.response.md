Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately follows the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of years it will take for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight by implementing the necessary logic where Limak's weight (`a`) is tripled and Bob's weight (`b`) is doubled each year. The while loop continues until Limak's weight becomes greater than Bob's weight, at which point the number of years is printed.

The input constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) ensure that Limak's weight is always less than or equal to Bob's weight, which aligns with the problem's guarantee. The program effectively handles all valid input cases within these constraints, including edge cases like when both weights are equal. 

For example, in the input case where `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the loop executes once, and the program correctly identifies that Limak will have a greater weight (3 > 2) after one year, producing the expected output of 1.

Since the implementation correctly computes how many years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's in every potential case, the code is correct.
