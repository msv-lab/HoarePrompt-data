The value of `a` is multiplied by 3. Since `a` is an input integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 30`, the new value of `a` is guaranteed to be between 3 and 90 (inclusive). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a value between 3 and 90, `b` is an input integer satisfying `2 ≤ b` and `b` must be at least equal to the previous value of `a`, `years` is still 1.

Output State: **`a` is a value between 3 and 90, `b` is an input integer satisfying `2 ≤ b` and `b` must be at least equal to the previous value of `a`, `years` is 1**.
