The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` composed of both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It determines the maximum number of unique lowercase letters that appear consecutively in `s`, resetting the count whenever a non-lowercase character is encountered. After processing, it prints this maximum count. If the string consists solely of non-lowercase characters, the output will be `0`. Additionally, there is no handling for invalid input or cases where the string may be empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The function does not accept parameters, it operates directly on user input.
