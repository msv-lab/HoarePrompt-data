You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the logic accurately adheres to the requirements specified.

The problem requires identifying the maximum number of distinct lowercase letter positions in a string (denoted as a pretty set) while ensuring that no uppercase letters exist between those positions. The given program attempts to do this by only collecting the indices of lowercase characters without considering the constraints involving uppercase letters.

Here are some cases to consider that demonstrate where the program fails:

1. **Case with Non-Contiguous Lowercase Letters:**
   Input: 
   ```
   7
   aAcaBc
   ```
   Expected Output: `2` (as we can take positions 0 and 2, or positions 2 and 4, but the program will output `4` because it counts all lowercase indices `[0, 2, 4]`). 

2. **Case with Multiple Uppercase Letters:**
   Input:
   ```
   10
   aBcDeFgHiJ
   ```
   Expected Output: `1` (only position 0). The program will incorrectly output `4` since it counts all lowercase letters without considering the uppercase letters present that separate them.

3. **Case where lowercase letters do not exist:**
   Input:
   ```
   5
   ABCDE
   ```
   Output: `0`. This case is correctly handled by the program but highlighting it shows that while it might handle this correctly, the presence of uppercase letters throughout other cases is not accounted for.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that no uppercase letters exist between the positions of lowercase letters chosen nor does it count distinct lowercase letters properly in contiguous segments.

Thus, because the program fails in the examples above, the correctness is determined to be:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of a string `s`, and the string `s` itself, which consists of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It counts the number of lowercase characters in the string and prints this count. However, the function does not validate if the length of `s` matches `n`, which is a potential edge case. After execution, the program will display the total number of lowercase letters in `s`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
