The `current_set` is updated by adding the character `char`, which is a lowercase letter and not already present in the `current_set`. This means `current_set` will now contain the letter `char`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 0, the first character of `s`, `char`, is a lowercase letter, and `char` is not in `current_set` (now it's in `current_set`).**
