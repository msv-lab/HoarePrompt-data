Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. It simply counts all lowercase letters in the string, regardless of whether they are distinct or separated by uppercase letters.

For example, consider the input `"aaaaBaabAbA"` which has a length of 11. The string has the lowercase letters `a` appearing multiple times and `b` once. However, there are uppercase letters in between the occurrences. The program counts 5 lowercase letters but the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in a pretty set, following the problem's conditions, is only 2.

Another example is the input `"zACaAbbaazzC"`. There are duplicates and uppercase letters interrupting groups of lowercase letters. The actual maximum pretty set is 3 distinct lowercase letters from positions without being interrupted by uppercase letters. The program would again provide an incorrect count based on the total lowercase letters rather than the unique conditions specified.

Thus, the program fails for various cases where uppercase letters interrupt the distinct lowercase letters.
