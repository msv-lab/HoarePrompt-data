Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the third character of `s`, if `char` is not in `current_set`, then `char` is added to `current_set` and `current_count` is increased by 1 while `max_count` remains unchanged. If `char` is already in `current_set`, `current_set`, `current_count`, and `max_count` remain unchanged.***
