Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 1, and `char` is a lowercase letter. If `char` is not already in `current_set`, `current_set` will include `char` and `current_count` will be set to 1.***
