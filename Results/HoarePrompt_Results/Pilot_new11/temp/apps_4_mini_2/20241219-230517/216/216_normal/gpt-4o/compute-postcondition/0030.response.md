The value of `current_count` is reset to 0. The initial state includes that `max_count` has been set to the maximum value between `max_count` and `current_count`, but since `current_count` was just set to 0, `max_count` remains unchanged based on its previous value. The values of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `char` is the third character of `s`; `current_set` is cleared; `current_count` is 0; `max_count` remains unchanged.**
