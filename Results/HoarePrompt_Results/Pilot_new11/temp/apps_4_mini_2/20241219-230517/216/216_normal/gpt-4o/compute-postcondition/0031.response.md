Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter not in `current_set`, then `char` is added to `current_set` and `current_count` is increased by 1 while `max_count` remains unchanged. If `char` is already in `current_set`, all variables remain unchanged. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, `current_set` is cleared, `current_count` is set to 0, and `max_count` remains unchanged.***
