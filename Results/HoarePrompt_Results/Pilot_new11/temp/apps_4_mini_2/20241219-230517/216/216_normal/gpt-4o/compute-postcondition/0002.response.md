The variable `max_count` is initialized to `0`. Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output state consists of the unchanged values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200); `s` is an input string of length equal to the new value of `n`; `max_count` is 0.**
