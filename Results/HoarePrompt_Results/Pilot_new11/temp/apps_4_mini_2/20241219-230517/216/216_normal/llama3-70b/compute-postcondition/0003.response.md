The `print(len(lowercase))` statement outputs the length of the list `lowercase`, which represents the number of indices of lowercase characters in the string `s`. The variable `lowercase` has been defined but its specific content or length has not been provided in the initial state.

Other variables (`n` and `s`) remain unchanged in this case. `n` is still an input positive integer in the range of 1 to 200, and `s` is still an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200); `s` is an input string; `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`; `len(lowercase)` is the length of the list `lowercase`.**
