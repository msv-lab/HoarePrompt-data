The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. Since `current_count` was initially 0, its new value will be 1. The other states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 1, the first character of `s`, `char`, is a lowercase letter, and `char` is in `current_set`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 1, the first character of `s`, `char`, is a lowercase letter, and `char` is in `current_set`.**
