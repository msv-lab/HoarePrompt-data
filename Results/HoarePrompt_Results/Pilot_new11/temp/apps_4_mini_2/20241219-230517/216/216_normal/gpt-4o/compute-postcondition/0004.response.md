`current_count` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200); `s` is an input string of length equal to the new value of `n`; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set; `current_count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200); `s` is an input string of length equal to the new value of `n`; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set; `current_count` is 0.**
