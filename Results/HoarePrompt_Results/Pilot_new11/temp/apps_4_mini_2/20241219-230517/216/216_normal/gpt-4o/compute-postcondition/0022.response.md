`current_count` is assigned the value `0`, which overrides its previous value. The previous value of `current_count` was determined based on whether `char` is a lowercase letter or not (it was either `1` or `0`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` remains unchanged.**
