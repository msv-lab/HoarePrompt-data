Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `char` is the second character of `s`, if `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` may now include `char` and `current_count` will be 2 if `char` is a lowercase letter, or 1 if `char` is not. If `char` was already in `current_set`, then the `current_count` remains unchanged.***
