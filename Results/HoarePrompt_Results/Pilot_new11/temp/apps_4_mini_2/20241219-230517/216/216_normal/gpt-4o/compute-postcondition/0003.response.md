The code `current_set = set()` initializes a new empty set and assigns it to the variable `current_set`. The previous values of the affected variables, `n`, `s`, and `max_count`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200); `s` is an input string of length equal to the new value of `n`; `max_count` is 0; `current_set` is an empty set.**
