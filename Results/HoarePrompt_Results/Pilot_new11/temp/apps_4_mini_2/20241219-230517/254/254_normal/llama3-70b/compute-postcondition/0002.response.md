According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue executing as long as `b` is non-zero (i.e., `b` is true). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the value `old_a % old_b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must not equal zero.

Since `b` is the result of the modulus operation, it will be zero if `old_a` is exactly divisible by `old_b`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need ensure that `old_a % old_b` is not zero. This implies that `old_a` must not be a multiple of `old_b`. 

However, we do not have explicit values for `old_a` and `old_b` in the given state. Therefore, we can't specify precise adjustments, but we can deduce that `old_a` must not be an integer multiple of `old_b`.

Thus, adjusting the state must encapsulate that `old_a` must not be perfectly divisible by `old_b`.

State: **`a` is the old value of `b`, `b` is the value `old_a % old_b`, and `old_a` must not be a multiple of `old_b`.**
