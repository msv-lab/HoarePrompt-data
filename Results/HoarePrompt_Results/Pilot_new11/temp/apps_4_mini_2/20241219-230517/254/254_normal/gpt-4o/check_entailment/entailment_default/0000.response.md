The code provided computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of three integers (k1, k2, k3) and checks if this GCD is equal to 1. If the GCD is 1, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that at least one is lit every second. If the GCD is greater than 1, it prints "NO", suggesting that there will be some time when no garland is lit.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of this program:
- The problem statement asks whether it is possible to choose three integers (denoting the times to switch on the three garlands) such that from the maximum of those integers, at least one garland is lit at every second. The requirement hinges on ensuring that at least one garland is active during all subsequent seconds.
- The GCD condition used does not properly encapsulate this requirement. Specifically, if k1, k2, and k3 share a common divisor greater than 1, it may still be possible to select values x1, x2, and x3 such that all subsequent seconds are covered.

For example, consider the input values k1=4, k2=2, k3=3. The GCD here is 1, so the output would incorrectly indicate "YES", while there is no way to light every second effectively after a certain point. 

Therefore, the program incorrectly assumes that checking the GCD of the three numbers is sufficient to determine if at least one garland will be lit every second, which is not always the case.

Correctness: **False**.
