You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem asks whether Mishka can choose three integers \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) to switch on three garlands with intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) in such a way that after \( \max(x_1, x_2, x_3) \), at least one garland is lit every second.

The program attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals using the formula:
```python
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
```
However, this approach is flawed for several reasons:

1. The calculation of LCM using the provided formula is incorrect. The formula segment `(func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))` does not produce the correct LCM of the three numbers. The LCM of two numbers can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
   When trying to extend this to three numbers (which is necessary here), the correct calculation should be:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(k1, k2, k3) = \text{LCM}(\text{LCM}(k1, k2), k3)
   \]

2. The final conditional checking if the calculated LCM is divisible by \( k1 \), \( k2 \), and \( k3 \) is also misleading. Even if the LCM is divisible by these intervals, it doesn't directly correlate to the requirement that there must be no gap in lit garlands in infinite time (i.e., the essence of covering every second after a certain point). 

3. The absence of edge cases is handled poorly. The program does not effectively account for situations where there may be gaps regardless of the LCM calculations, especially when garlands have intervals such as \( k_1 = 4, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 7 \). It is clear in this case that the second garland covers every second, but the others do not harmoniously overlap.

Thus, the program won't function as intended, particularly in edge cases where the interplay of \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) creates gaps in the lit times of garlands.

One specific failing case is when \( k_1 = 4, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 3 \):
- \( k_1 \) will lit at: 0, 4, 8, 12, ... (every 4th second)
- \( k_2 \) will lit at: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... (every 2nd second)
- \( k_3 \) will lit at: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, ... (every 3rd second)

Despite \( k_2 \) covering every second, the approach taken by computing LCM is inappropriate for exploring all arrangement possibilities for \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) as described.

Given the flawed mathematical approach, the failure to meet the problem requirements leads to the conclusion:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are integers representing the time intervals of the three garlands, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`, `c` is an integer representing the time intervals (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500)
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor 'a' of the original values of 'a' and 'b', where 'b' is 0 and the constraints 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500 are satisfied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, representing time intervals, where both must be in the range [1, 1500]. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function repeatedly updates `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` holds the GCD. The annotations incorrectly imply that the function takes a third parameter `c`, but this is not reflected in the code. There’s also no error handling for cases when the inputs could be out of bounds. Hence, while the function correctly computes the GCD for valid inputs, it lacks validation for the input constraints and does not utilize the variable `c` at all.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
