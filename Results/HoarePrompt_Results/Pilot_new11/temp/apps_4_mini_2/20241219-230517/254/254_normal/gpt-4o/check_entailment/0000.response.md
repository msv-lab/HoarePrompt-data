To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to check whether the program correctly identifies whether it is possible to choose moments for switching on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit at every second after the maximum of those moments.

The program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) for the three garland time intervals. The condition it checks is whether the GCD of the three time intervals is equal to 1. However, this checks only if the intervals share a common factor, and it does not properly account for the required logic that it is possible to have overlapping lit times starting from some chosen moments.

### Test Cases:
1. **Example Input**: `2 2 3` 
   - GCD(2, 2, 3) = 1 -> Correctly outputs "YES".
  
2. **Example Input**: `4 2 3` 
   - GCD(4, 2, 3) = 1 -> Correctly outputs "NO".
   
However, the reasoning based on the GCD is flawed. For instance, let's consider the time intervals `4, 6, 8`. Their GCD is actually 2. However, one could select (4, 4, 2) for x values:
- Garland 1 will be lit during: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20...
- Garland 2 will be lit during: 2, 8, 14...
- Garland 3 will be lit during: 1, 9, 17...

This implies there could be moments when no garland is lit at certain seconds after they start. Therefore, the program doesn't handle the possibility of certain combinations where gaps exist, meaning there's a case where the output would be incorrect.

Thus, we find that the program might output "NO" inaccurately due to the reliance on the GCD solely. There are combinations with common GCDs greater than `1` which still allow for adequate coverage of time seconds.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly address all potential combinations required by the problem statement. It relies solely on the GCD check, which is not sufficient for guaranteeing at least one garland is lit at every second.
