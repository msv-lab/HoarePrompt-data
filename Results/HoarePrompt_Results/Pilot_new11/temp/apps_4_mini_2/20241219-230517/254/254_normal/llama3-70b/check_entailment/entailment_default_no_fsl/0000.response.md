Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to correctly determine if there is a way to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit at every second after switching them on. The logic used in the program involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) using the greatest common divisor (GCD), which does not address the requirement posed by the problem.

One specific failing case is as follows:

Input:
```
4 2 3
```
In this scenario, it seems that no matter how the garlands are switched on, there will be gaps where no garland is lit. The program should return "NO". However, based on the provided logic, it attempts to confirm conditions based on the LCM that could misleadingly suggest it is possible to have a valid configuration.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, indicating its correctness as **False**.
