To evaluate the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem asks whether Mishka can choose three integers \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) to switch on three garlands with intervals \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) in such a way that after \( \max(x_1, x_2, x_3) \), at least one garland is lit every second.

The program attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals using the formula:
```python
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
```
However, this approach is flawed for several reasons:

1. The calculation of LCM using the provided formula is incorrect. The formula segment `(func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))` does not produce the correct LCM of the three numbers. The LCM of two numbers can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
   When trying to extend this to three numbers (which is necessary here), the correct calculation should be:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(k1, k2, k3) = \text{LCM}(\text{LCM}(k1, k2), k3)
   \]

2. The final conditional checking if the calculated LCM is divisible by \( k1 \), \( k2 \), and \( k3 \) is also misleading. Even if the LCM is divisible by these intervals, it doesn't directly correlate to the requirement that there must be no gap in lit garlands in infinite time (i.e., the essence of covering every second after a certain point). 

3. The absence of edge cases is handled poorly. The program does not effectively account for situations where there may be gaps regardless of the LCM calculations, especially when garlands have intervals such as \( k_1 = 4, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 7 \). It is clear in this case that the second garland covers every second, but the others do not harmoniously overlap.

Thus, the program won't function as intended, particularly in edge cases where the interplay of \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \) creates gaps in the lit times of garlands.

One specific failing case is when \( k_1 = 4, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 3 \):
- \( k_1 \) will lit at: 0, 4, 8, 12, ... (every 4th second)
- \( k_2 \) will lit at: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... (every 2nd second)
- \( k_3 \) will lit at: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, ... (every 3rd second)

Despite \( k_2 \) covering every second, the approach taken by computing LCM is inappropriate for exploring all arrangement possibilities for \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) as described.

Given the flawed mathematical approach, the failure to meet the problem requirements leads to the conclusion:

Correctness: **False**.
