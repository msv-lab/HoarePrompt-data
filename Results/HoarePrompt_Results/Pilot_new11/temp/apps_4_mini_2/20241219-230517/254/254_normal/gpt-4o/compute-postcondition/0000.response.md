The values of `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are assigned new values from the input split and converted to integers. These new values will be within the range defined by the initial state, meaning that after this operation, `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` will still be integers and maintain the condition that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3. 

Output State: **`k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers within the range defined by the input values, where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3.**
