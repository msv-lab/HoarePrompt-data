The `count` variable is assigned the result of `Counter(cards)`, which creates a frequency distribution of the elements in the list `cards`. Since `n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `cards` will contain `n` integers each ranging between 1 and 100 inclusive. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `cards` is a list containing `n` integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency distribution of `cards`.**
