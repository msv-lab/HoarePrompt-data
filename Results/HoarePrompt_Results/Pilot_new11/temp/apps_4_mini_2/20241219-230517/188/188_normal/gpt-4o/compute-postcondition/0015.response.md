Functionality: **The function reads an even integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) from input, followed by `n` integers representing cards (each between 1 and 100 inclusive). It counts the frequency of each unique card and sorts them by their frequency. If there are fewer than two unique card values, it outputs 'NO'. If there are at least two unique card values, it checks if the two most frequent cards both appear exactly `n // 2` times. If so, it prints 'YES' followed by the two card values; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. In cases where the input does not follow the expected format (non-integer values, odd `n`, etc.), the function lacks error handling and will cause a runtime error instead of gracefully managing those scenarios.**
