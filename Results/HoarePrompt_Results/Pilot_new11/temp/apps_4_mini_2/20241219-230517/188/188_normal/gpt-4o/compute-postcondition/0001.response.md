The variable `cards` is assigned a list of `n` integers, where `n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. Each integer in the list `cards` is obtained by reading user input and converting it into an integer. Since `n` is defined, `cards` will contain exactly `n` integers, each of which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `cards` is a list containing `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
