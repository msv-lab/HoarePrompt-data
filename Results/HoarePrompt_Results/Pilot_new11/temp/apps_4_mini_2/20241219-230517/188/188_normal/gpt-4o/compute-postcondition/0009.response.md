The code prints the last two elements of the `unique_numbers` list, which are the two most frequent unique numbers from `count`. Since `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique keys based on frequency, `unique_numbers[-1]` is the most frequent number and `unique_numbers[-2]` is the second most frequent number.

The other variables remain unchanged, and the message 'YES' has already been printed prior to executing this code.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `cards` is a list containing `n` integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency distribution of `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique keys from `count` based on their frequency with a length of 2 or more; the last two unique numbers printed are `unique_numbers[-1]` and `unique_numbers[-2]`.**
