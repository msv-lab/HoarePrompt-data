Postcondition: ***`n` is an input even integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `cards` is a list containing `n` integers each between 1 and 100 inclusive; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequency distribution of `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique keys from `count` based on their frequency. If `unique_numbers` contains less than 2 unique elements, the output is 'NO'. If `unique_numbers` has a length of 2 or more and the last two unique numbers each appear exactly `n // 2` times, those numbers are printed. Otherwise, the printed output is 'NO'.***
