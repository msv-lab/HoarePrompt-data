The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` indicates a limit on distribution, and `a` and `b` represent the number of pieces for two different cakes. The function executes a binary search to determine the maximum integer value `k` (returning `k = low - 1`) such that it is not possible to equally distribute `k` cake pieces among `n` participants. The final result indicates the highest successful distribution that could be made before reaching an unsuccessful attempt, represented by `low - 1`. If no successful distribution occurs, the returned value will be less than or equal to zero. The function, however, does not validate if `n` exceeds the total of `a + b`, which could lead to edge cases where distribution is judged impossible by the logic of `can_distribute` even if there are sufficient pieces available.
