Correctness: **False**

The program in its current form does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

The key points of the problem description are as follows:
1. Each piece of each cake must be put on some plate.
2. Each plate must contain at least one piece of cake.
3. No plate can contain pieces from both cakes.
4. The goal is to maximize the minimum number of pieces on each plate (i.e., maximize `x`).

The logical error in the code lies in the conditional checks within the loop. Specifically, the while loop checks:
```python
if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x:
```
While the first two conditions (`a >= x` and `b >= x`) properly ensure that each cake can give at least `x` pieces, the third condition (`a - x + (b - x) >= x`) does not properly reflect the requirement that all plates must satisfy the minimum of `x` pieces while also considering the total number of plates `n`.

In fact, the correct expression should assess whether the total number of pieces can be sufficiently allocated across the plates. It should check whether `a - x` and `b - x`, after distributing pieces to `n` plates, can still uphold that every plate has at least one piece each.

Additionally, the decrement of `x` continues until it possibly goes below zero, allowing for values of `x` that do not make sense for the context of the problem, as `x` should be non-negative.

For example, with input `5 2 3`, the valid maximum x should be `1` since there are `5` plates and `5` total pieces from both cakes. The program's current logic may not always produce this expected outcome.

Thus, the program fails to correctly capture the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. This misalignment leads to invalid results for certain inputs, demonstrating that the program is not correct as required.
