Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`, and `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
