`x` is assigned the value of the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Given that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers based on user input satisfying the conditions `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`, `x` will be the smallest value among these three. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`; `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`; `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b`.**
