To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the provided code.

### Problem Requirements:
1. There are `n` plates.
2. There are `a` pieces of the first cake and `b` pieces of the second cake.
3. Each piece of cake must be placed on a plate.
4. Each plate must have at least one piece of cake.
5. No plate can have pieces from both cakes.
6. We need to maximize the minimum number of pieces on each plate.

### Given Program:
```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

#Function 2:
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Low and High Initialization**:
   - `low` is initialized to 1 (the minimum number of pieces that can be on a plate).
   - `high` is initialized to `min(a, b) + 1`. This indicates that at most each plate can have pieces equal to the smaller cake quantity plus one (which is not inclusive).

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The loop continues while `low` is less than `high`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated to check whether it's possible to distribute `mid` pieces on each plate using the `can_distribute` function.
   - If distribution is possible (`can_distribute(mid)` is true), `low` is adjusted to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `high` is adjusted to `mid`.

3. **Distribution Check (`can_distribute`)**:
   - The `can_distribute` function calculates how many plates can be filled if each plate has at least `x` pieces, summing available pieces divided by `x` for both cakes.
   - It checks if this sum is at least `n`, the number of plates.

### Finding Edge Cases:
- The potential error in the program arises from the use of global variables `a` and `b` inside the `can_distribute` function without passing them as parameters. If `a` and `b` are not defined as global variables or not passed to the function explicitly, this could raise an error.
- Additionally, with the initialization of `high`, there is a scenario where `min(a, b)` becomes `0`. For example, if `a = 0` and `b = x`, this could lead to incorrect handling because `high` would be `1`, but logically, you can't distribute cakes since one type has no pieces.

### Practical Test Cases:
1. **Input:** `2 0 5`
   - Expected Output: Cannot place any pieces since one cake has 0.
   - The code would potentially throw an error due to `a` and `b` not being accessible, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Input:** `5 2 1`
   - Expected Output: 0, since only 3 pieces total are available, and 5 plates need pieces.
   - The answer would be off as in the current implementation, it would not be able to handle that case correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program has critical flaws, particularly regarding variable accessibility and handling the case where one of the cakes has zero pieces. 

Correctness: **False**.
