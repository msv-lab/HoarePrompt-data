According to the code, this is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `x`. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`n` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`; `a` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`; `b` is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b`**
