You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the `func` function:

The goal of the function is to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that the pieces of two cakes can be distributed over \( n \) plates, with each plate having at least \( x \) pieces, without mixing the two cakes on any plate.

1. The function starts by setting \( x \) to the minimum of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
2. It enters a while-loop that checks the distribution conditions.
3. The loop condition checks if there are enough pieces of both cakes to give \( x \) pieces to each of the plates and whether the leftover pieces can still satisfy having \( x \) pieces per plate.

However, there is a key element that may lead to failure:

- The loop begins with \( x \) equal to the minimum of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) and immediately goes into the loop. If \( x \) cannot satisfy the condition \( (a - x + (b - x) >= x) \) on the first check (as \( x \) decreases), it will decrement \( x \) until the condition is satisfied or until \( x \) falls below 1, which is invalid given the constraints.
- The logic fails in cases where \( a \) and \( b \) are not sufficient to even allow one piece per plate in an optimal distribution. For example, if \( n = 3 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( b = 1 \), although one piece can be distributed, we cannot satisfy all plates (\( n = 3 \)) having at least one based on the specified logic.

A potential failing test case:
- Input: `3 1 1`
- Expected Output: `0` (since you can't put at least one piece on three plates)
- The current algorithm does not correctly handle this scenario since it will start decremented from the minimum \( x \) and may lead to invalid configurations.

Thus, because this logic potentially fails for certain input configurations, we conclude that the program does not fully satisfy the requirements for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`. It calculates the largest integer `x` such that `x <= min(n, a, b)` and ensures that `a` and `b` can collectively provide enough pieces to satisfy the condition `a >= x`, `b >= x`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x`. If the initial value of `x` does not meet these conditions, the function decrementally adjusts `x` until a valid state is achieved or until `x` becomes less than zero. Finally, the function prints the calculated value of `x`, which may be `0` if no valid configuration exists within the constraints. Thus, the function outputs the maximum number of pieces of cake that can be evenly distributed, taking into account the given constraints and limitations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
