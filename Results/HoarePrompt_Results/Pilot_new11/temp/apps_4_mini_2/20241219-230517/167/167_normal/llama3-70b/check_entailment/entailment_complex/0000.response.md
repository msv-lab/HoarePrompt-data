To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to examine whether the code comprehensively handles the task defined in the description.

### Breakdown of the Problem Description
1. A matrix \( A \) of size \( x \times y \) filled with integers must be constructed such that:
   - Each entry in the matrix corresponds to the formula \( A_{i,j} = y(i - 1) + j \), meaning every integer from the range \( [1..xy] \) occurs exactly once.
   - The program must verify whether it's possible to have dimensions \( x \) and \( y \) such that a sequence of integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) can be visited in valid adjacent cell movements.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The core of the program consists of the following:
1. It first reads the values of \( n \) and the list \( a \).
2. It employs nested loops to try all possible pairs of \( x \) and \( y \) with the constraint that \( x \times y \) must be strictly greater than the maximum value in \( a \).
3. For each pair \( (x, y) \), the program checks the following:
   - Ensure that all values in \( a \) are within the allowed range \( [1, x \times y] \).
   - It calls the function `func_1` to verify the sequence of moves is valid (i.e., stepping only to adjacent cells).

### Function `func_1`:
- This function calculates the coordinates of each number in the matrix based on its values and checks if the difference in coordinates between sequential elements of the path is equal to 1 (indicating valid movement). 

### Key Points of Checking:
1. **Matrix Size**: The program checks that \( x \) and \( y \) can be chosen such that \( 1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9 \) and \( x \times y \) accommodates values in \( a \).
2. **Range of Movement**: The shifting mechanism implemented in `func_1` accurately checks the adjacency condition necessary for valid movement through a matrix.

### Conclusion:
- The loops thoroughly explore valid \( (x, y) \) pairs up to \( 10^6 \) and check whether the path derived from the list \( a \) is valid. If it finds at least one valid combination, it outputs "YES" along with the values of \( x \) and \( y \). Otherwise, it returns "NO".
- There are no apparent flaws in logic or handling for the described requirements, and the input constraints have been respected as stipulated by the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
