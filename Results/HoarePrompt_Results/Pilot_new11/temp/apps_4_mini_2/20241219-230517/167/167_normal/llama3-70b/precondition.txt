x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. The input path consists of a sequence of integers where their values correspond to unique cells in a hypothetical x × y matrix, and the first integer in the sequence corresponds to the cell at position (1, 1), with additional constraints implying possible valid movements through adjacent cells.
