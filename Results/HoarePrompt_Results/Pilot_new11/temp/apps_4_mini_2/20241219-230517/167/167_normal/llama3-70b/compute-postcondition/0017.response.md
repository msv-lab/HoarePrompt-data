Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements; `px` and `py` are the final coordinates derived from the last element of the list `a`, specifically `nx` is equal to (a[n-1] - 1) // `y`, `ny` is equal to (a[n-1] - 1) % `y`; the loop executes successfully if the absolute sum of the differences between the coordinates resulting from the current and previous elements meets the condition `abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) = 1` for all elements in `a`. If the loop does not execute, then `px` and `py` remain at their initial values of 0.**
