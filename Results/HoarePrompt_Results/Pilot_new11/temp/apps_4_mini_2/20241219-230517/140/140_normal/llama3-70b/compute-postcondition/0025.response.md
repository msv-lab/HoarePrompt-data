The line of code `rec_stack[node] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `node` in the `rec_stack`, indicating that the current node is no longer part of the recursion stack. 

- `node` is an integer that represents a valid index for `graph`.
- The `visited` set contains integers representing all neighbors of `node` that have been visited during the loop, and it remains unchanged.
- The `rec_stack` structure is altered, with the specific index corresponding to `node` being set to `False`. The previous state of this index in `rec_stack` was `True`, indicating that the node was part of the recursion stack during the cycle detection process.

After these observations, we conclude that the key changes involve the state of `rec_stack` at the index specified by `node`.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, `visited` is a set of integers including all neighbors of `node` that were visited during the loop, `rec_stack[node]` is False.**
