`rec_stack[node]` is assigned the value `True`, indicating that the current vertex `node` is now marked as being in the recursion stack. Other variables are not affected, and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is an integer representing the current vertex, `graph` is a list of tuples representing the directed edges, `visited` is a set of integers including `node` marked as `True`, and `rec_stack` now includes `node` marked as `True`.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing the current vertex, `graph` is a list of tuples representing the directed edges, `visited` is a set of integers including `node` marked as `True`, `rec_stack` includes `node` marked as `True`.**
