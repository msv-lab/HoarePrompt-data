Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, `graph[node]` has at least two neighbors left unvisited, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in the list of neighbors for `node`. If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns True, it indicates that there are valid neighbors left unvisited for the given node in the graph. Otherwise (if the condition is False), no changes occur as there is no else part defined.***
