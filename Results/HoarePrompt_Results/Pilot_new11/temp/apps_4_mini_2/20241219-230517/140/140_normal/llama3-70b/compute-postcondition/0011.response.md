Postcondition: ***`node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, and `graph[node]` has at least one neighbor. If `visited[neighbor]` is false for the current neighbor, the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns false. Otherwise, if `visited[neighbor]` is true for every neighbor of `node`, then `rec_stack[neighbor]` is false for every neighbor of `node`.***
