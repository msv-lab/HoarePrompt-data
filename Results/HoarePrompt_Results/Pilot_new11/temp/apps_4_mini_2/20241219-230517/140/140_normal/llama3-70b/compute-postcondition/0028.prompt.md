You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: node is an integer representing the current vertex, graph is a list of tuples representing the directed edges, visited is a set of integers containing the visited vertices, and rec_stack is a set of integers used to track the recursion stack of vertices.
def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node` is an integer representing a valid index for `graph`, `visited` is a set of integers including all neighbors of `node` that were visited during the loop, `rec_stack` records whether any neighbors of `node` are currently in the recursion stack, and the loop concludes with no unvisited neighbors left in the graph for `node` or a cycle has been detected.
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that node has not been identified as part of a cycle in the graph since rec_stack[node] is False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters node (an integer), graph (a list of tuples), visited (a set of integers), and rec_stack (a set of integers) and returns True or False based on the traversal and visitation status of nodes in the directed graph.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True indicating a valid traversal in the graph from the current node to a neighbor

Case_2: The program returns True, indicating that the node has been successfully visited and its neighbors are accounted for in the recursion stack.

Case_3: The program returns True indicating that there are valid neighbors left unvisited for the given node in the graph

Case_4: The program returns True, indicating that the function confirms the current node has unvisited neighbors available for exploration.

Case_5: The program returns True, indicating that there is at least one unvisited neighbor left for the given valid index 'node' in 'graph'.

Case_6: The program returns True, indicating that the current node has at least one unvisited neighbor left in the graph.

Case_7: The program returns False, indicating that node has not been identified as part of a cycle in the graph since rec_stack[node] is False.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
