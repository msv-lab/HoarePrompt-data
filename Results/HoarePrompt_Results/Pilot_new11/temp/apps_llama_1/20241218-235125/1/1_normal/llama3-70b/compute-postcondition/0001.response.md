The code `n = len(s)` assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since the length of `s` is between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), the value of `n` will also be between 1 and 500000 (inclusive).

Output State: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000**
