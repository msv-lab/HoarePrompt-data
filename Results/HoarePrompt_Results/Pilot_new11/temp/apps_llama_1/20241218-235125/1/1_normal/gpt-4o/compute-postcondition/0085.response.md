Functionality: **The function reads an input string `s` of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |. It then checks for specific patterns in the string: the presence of '[' and ']', and ':' characters between them. If '[' or ']' is missing, or if they are in the wrong order, the function prints -1. If ':' characters are found, it checks for '|' characters between the first and last ':' characters. If '|' characters are found, it calculates the result as 4 plus the number of '|' characters and prints this value. If no '|' characters are found, or if the ':' characters are in the wrong order, the function prints -1. The function does not return any values, but instead prints the result or -1 to the console. It handles various edge cases, including empty strings, strings with no '[' or ']', strings with no ':' characters, and strings with '|' characters outside the '[' and ']' boundaries.**
