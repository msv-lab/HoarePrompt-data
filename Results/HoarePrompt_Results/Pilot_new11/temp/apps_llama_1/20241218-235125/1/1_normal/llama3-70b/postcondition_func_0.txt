The function takes an input string `s` of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |. It attempts to find the index of the first ':' after a '[' and the index of the first ':' before a ']'. If either of these indices is not found, or if the index of the first ':' after a '[' is greater than or equal to the index of the first ':' before a ']', the function prints -1. Otherwise, it counts the number of '|' characters between these two indices and prints 4 plus this count. The function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases outside of the specified string length and character set, and it does not return any value in the classical sense, but rather prints its result directly to the console.
