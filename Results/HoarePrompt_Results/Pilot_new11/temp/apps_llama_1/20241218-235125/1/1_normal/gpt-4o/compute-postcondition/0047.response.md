The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The initial conditions are still valid after the code has been executed: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` must be at least `ind + 2`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` must be at least `ind + 2`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `bind` must be at least `ind + 2`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
