Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character between the first '[' and the last ']' if it exists, otherwise -1, `i` is equal to `ind`, and `end_colon` is the index of the last ':' character between the first '[' and the last ']' if it exists, otherwise -1. The current values of `start_colon` and `end_colon` are such that either `start_colon` is -1, or `end_colon` is -1, or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`.**
