Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is 1, and if the condition `f` is true, then `ind` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part***
