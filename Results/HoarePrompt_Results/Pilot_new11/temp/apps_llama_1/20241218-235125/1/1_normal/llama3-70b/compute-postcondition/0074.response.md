Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is the integer equal to the length of `s` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `ind` is the index of the first ':' after a '[' in `s` and `ind` must be less than `bind - 3`, `bind` is the index of the ':' character and `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3`, `i` is `ind + 3`, `f` is `True`. If `s[i]` is '|', then `ans` is either 5, 6, or 7; otherwise, `ans` can be 4, 5, or 6.***
