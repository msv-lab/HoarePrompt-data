Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. It attempts to find the first ':' after a '[' and the first ':' before a ']', and if these indices are valid, it counts the number of '|' characters between them and adds 4 to get the maximum possible length of the accordion. 

The code handles all the edge cases correctly. If either of the indices is not found, or if the index of the first ':' after a '[' is greater than or equal to the index of the first ':' before a ']', the code prints -1, indicating that it's not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from the string. 

The code also works correctly for the examples provided in the problem description. For the input '|[a:b:|]', it correctly outputs 4, and for the input '|]:[|:', it correctly outputs -1. 

The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, providing examples of the cases where the code works correctly and indicating that the code handles the specified string length and character set correctly. 

Overall, the code correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles all the edge cases correctly, so the correctness is True.
