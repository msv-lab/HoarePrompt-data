Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `n` is greater than 1, if `s[i]` is '[', then `ind` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `ind` and `i` remain unchanged.**
