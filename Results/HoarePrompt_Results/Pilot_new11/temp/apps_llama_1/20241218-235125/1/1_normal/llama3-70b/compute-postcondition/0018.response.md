The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the loop or switch statement that it is currently inside. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain the same.

Output State: **`s` is the input string of length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1 where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500000, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
