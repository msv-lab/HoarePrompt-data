The value of `end_colon` is updated to `i`, which is `bind - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, with at least one '[' and one ']', `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is the index of the first '[' in `s` and is not -1, `bind` is the index of the last ']' in `s` and is not -1, `ind` is less than `bind - 1`, `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character between the first '[' and the last ']' if it exists, otherwise -1, `i` is equal to `bind - 1`, and `end_colon` is equal to `i`, which is `bind - 1`, and the current value of `s[i]` is ':'.
