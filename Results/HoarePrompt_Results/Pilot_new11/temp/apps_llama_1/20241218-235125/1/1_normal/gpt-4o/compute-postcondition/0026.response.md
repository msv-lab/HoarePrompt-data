Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 500000 consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000, equal to `len(s)`, `ind` is either -1 if no '[' is found in `s` or the index of the first '[' in `s` otherwise, `i` is `n - 2`. If `s` at index `n - 2` is ']', then `bind` is `n - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s` at index `n - 2` is not ']', then no changes occur.**
