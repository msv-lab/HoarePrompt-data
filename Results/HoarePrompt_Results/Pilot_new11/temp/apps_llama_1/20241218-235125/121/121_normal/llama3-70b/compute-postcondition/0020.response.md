Given that `c` is 'G', the code `count[c] = avg - count[c]` updates the count of 'G' in the dictionary `count`.

The original count of 'G' is `count['G']`, and `avg` is `n // 4`. 

The new count of 'G' is `avg - count['G']`, which is `(n // 4) - count['G']`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count` is a dictionary with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where 'A', 'T' have their original counts in `s`, 'C' has a count of `(n // 4) - original_count_c`, 'G' has a count of `(n // 4) - original_count_G`, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count` is a dictionary with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where 'A', 'T' have their original counts in `s`, 'C' has a count of `(n // 4) - original_count_c`, 'G' has a count of `(n // 4) - count['G']`, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is 'G'**
