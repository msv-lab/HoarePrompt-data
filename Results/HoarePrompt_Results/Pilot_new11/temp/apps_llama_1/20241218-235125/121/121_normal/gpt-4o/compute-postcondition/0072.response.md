Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. If `counts['C']` is less than `target_count`, then `counts['C']` is increased by 1, `char` is 'C', `i` is 2, `result[2]` is 'C' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counts['C']` is not less than `target_count`, then no changes are made.***
