Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`. If the second character `c` of `s` is '?', then `count` is a dictionary where the first character `nc` in 'ACGT' with an original count greater than 0 has its count decremented by 1, and `res` is updated by appending the first such `nc`, or remains unchanged if all original counts are 0. If `c` is not '?', then `res` is a string containing the second character of `s` repeated twice, and `count` remains a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is `n // 4 - original_count[key]`.**
