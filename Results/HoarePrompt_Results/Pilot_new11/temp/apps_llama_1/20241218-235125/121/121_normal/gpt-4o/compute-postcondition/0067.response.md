Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1, the second element of `result` is `char`, and `i` is 1, otherwise no changes are made to `counts`, `result`, or `i`.***
