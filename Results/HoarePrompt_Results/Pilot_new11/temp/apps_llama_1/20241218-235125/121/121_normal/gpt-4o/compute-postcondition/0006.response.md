Since the provided code snippet is empty (`return`), it will return `None` by default in Python. The initial state describes variables `n` and `s` derived from `data`, a list of strings, and mentions that `'==='` has been printed, but these do not influence the return value of the given code snippet.

Output State: **The program returns None**
