Correctness: **True**

This program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. It first counts the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`.
2. It calculates the average count of each nucleotide, which should be equal in the decoded genome.
3. It then adjusts the count of each nucleotide to be the difference between the average count and the current count. This effectively calculates how many more of each nucleotide are needed to reach the average count.
4. It iterates over the input string `s` again, replacing each '?' with the first nucleotide that still needs to be increased to reach the average count.
5. Finally, it checks if any nucleotides still need to be increased after replacing all '?'. If any do, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

This approach ensures that the program correctly decodes the genome by replacing each '?' with the nucleotide that will make the counts of all nucleotides equal, if possible. If it is not possible to decode the genome, it correctly prints '==='.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the input string `s` already has equal counts of all nucleotides.
* When the input string `s` has '?' characters that can be replaced to make the counts of all nucleotides equal.
* When the input string `s` has '?' characters that cannot be replaced to make the counts of all nucleotides equal.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
