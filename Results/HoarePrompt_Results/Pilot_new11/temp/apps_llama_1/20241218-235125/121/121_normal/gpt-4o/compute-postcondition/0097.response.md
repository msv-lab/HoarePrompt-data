Functionality: **The function processes an input string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, and each character in `s` can be one of the four nucleotide types 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', or an unrecognized nucleotide '?'. It checks if the length `n` is divisible by 4 and the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' are evenly distributed. If `n` is not divisible by 4, or if any of the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' exceed `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns None. Otherwise, it replaces allOccurrences of '?' in the string with the first available nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count less than `n // 4`, and then prints the modified string. The function does not return any explicit value in the case where it successfully processes the input string. Additionally, if the input string contains only '?' characters, and their count is evenly divisible by 4, the function will also replace them with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in that order, up to `n // 4` occurrences each. The function's behavior implies that it assumes the input will always be provided in the standard format of two lines: the first line containing the integer `n`, and the second line containing the string `s`.**
