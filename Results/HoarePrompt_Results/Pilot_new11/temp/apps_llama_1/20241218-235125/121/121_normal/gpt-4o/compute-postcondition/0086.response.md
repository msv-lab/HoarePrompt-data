Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then the value of `char` in the `counts` dictionary is increased by 1, `result[i]` is equal to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, no changes are made to `counts` or `result[i]`.***
