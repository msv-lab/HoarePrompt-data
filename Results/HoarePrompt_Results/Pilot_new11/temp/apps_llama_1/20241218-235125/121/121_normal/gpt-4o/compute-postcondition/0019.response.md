Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `char` is the third character in `s`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where if `char` is already a key in `counts`, then `counts[char]` is increased by 1 from its previous value, which was either increased by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `char` is one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'; otherwise, `counts` remains unchanged***
