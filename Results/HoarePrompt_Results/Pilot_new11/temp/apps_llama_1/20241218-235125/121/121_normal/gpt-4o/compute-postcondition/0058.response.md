Postcondition: **`n` is an integer divisible by 4 and greater than 1, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', the current value of `counts['A']` is less than `target_count`, `result` is a list with its first element set to the first character in `s` that has a count less than `target_count`, if `result[0]` is '?', the current index `i` is 1, and the current character `char` is 'A'**
