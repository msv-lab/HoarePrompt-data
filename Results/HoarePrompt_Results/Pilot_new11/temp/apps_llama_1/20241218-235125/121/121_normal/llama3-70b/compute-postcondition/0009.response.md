Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in the string. If `c` is not '?', then `count[c]` is the count of `c` in `s` plus one, equals to `count[c] + 1`. If `c` is '?', then the state remains unchanged as there is no action specified for this condition.**
