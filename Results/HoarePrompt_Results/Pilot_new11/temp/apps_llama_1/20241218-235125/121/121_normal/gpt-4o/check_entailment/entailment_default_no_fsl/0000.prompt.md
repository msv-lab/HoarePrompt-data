You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Output hints: The function processes an input string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, and each character in `s` can be one of the four nucleotide types 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', or an unrecognized nucleotide '?'. It checks if the length `n` is divisible by 4 and the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' are evenly distributed. If `n` is not divisible by 4, or if any of the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' exceed `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns None. Otherwise, it replaces allOccurrences of '?' in the string with the first available nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count less than `n // 4`, and then prints the modified string. The function does not return any explicit value in the case where it successfully processes the input string. Additionally, if the input string contains only '?' characters, and their count is evenly divisible by 4, the function will also replace them with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in that order, up to `n // 4` occurrences each. The function's behavior implies that it assumes the input will always be provided in the standard format of two lines: the first line containing the integer `n`, and the second line containing the string `s`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
