The value of `n` is updated to be an input integer, overwriting its previous value. The input integer `n` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The state of `s` remains unchanged, as it depends on the previous value of `n` which may or may not be the same as the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length that was previously `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' such that the total count of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s` plus the count of '?' in `s` equals the previous value of `n`.**
