Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is the integer result of `n` divided by 4, `nc` is 'A'. If `count['A']` is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 'A' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of the initial value of `count['A']` being at least 0.**
