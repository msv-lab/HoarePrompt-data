According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again for the third character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, and the second character `c` of `s` has been processed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters and the loop will process the third character of `s`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`**
