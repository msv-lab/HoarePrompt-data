You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if n % 4 != 0:
        print('===')
        return
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
    print(''.join(result))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program provided is designed to decode a genome string by replacing unrecognized nucleotides '?' with one of the four types 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that the number of each type becomes equal.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The program first checks if the length of the genome string is divisible by 4. If not, it prints '===' as it's impossible to have an equal number of each nucleotide type in this case.

2. **Counting Existing Nucleotides**: It then counts the occurrences of each nucleotide type in the string and checks if any of these counts exceed the target count (i.e., the length of the string divided by 4). If any count does exceed the target, it prints '===' because it's impossible to achieve an equal distribution in such a case.

3. **Replacing Unknown Nucleotides**: The program iterates through the string, replacing '?' with the first nucleotide type that has a count less than the target. This greedy approach ensures that each type's count is incremented as needed until it reaches the target count or until all '?' have been replaced.

The program handles the constraints and edge cases as follows:

- It correctly identifies cases where the string length is not divisible by 4 or where some nucleotides already exceed the target count.
- It replaces '?' with nucleotides in a way that strives to balance the counts, which aligns with the problem's requirement for an equal number of each nucleotide type.
- The use of a dictionary for counting nucleotides and a list for the result ensures efficient iteration and modification of characters.

Given the logic and the handling of edge cases, the program seems to correctly solve the problem as described. Without a specific counterexample where the program fails to decode the genome correctly according to the problem description, we must conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases described.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 255. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' and the number of each of the four nucleotide types 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' plus the number of unrecognized nucleotides '?' can be divided evenly by 4.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, and `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, i.e., `n % 4 == 0`.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, `n` is divisible by 4 with no remainder, `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value for each key is the count of the respective character in `s`.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is a string, `data` is a list of strings read from the standard input stream, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' containing the respective character counts in `s`, and if the program hasn't returned, all character counts in `s` are less than or equal to `target_count`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer divisible by 4, `s` is the original string, `data` is a list of strings, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is the updated count after the loop execution, and `result` is a list of characters where each index is either the original character from `s` or an updated character from the `counts` dictionary.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer between 4 and 255, and each character in `s` can be one of the four nucleotide types 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', or an unrecognized nucleotide '?'. It checks if the length `n` is divisible by 4 and the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' are evenly distributed. If `n` is not divisible by 4, or if any of the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' exceed `n // 4`, it prints '===' and returns None. Otherwise, it replaces allOccurrences of '?' in the string with the first available nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that has a count less than `n // 4`, and then prints the modified string. The function does not return any explicit value in the case where it successfully processes the input string. Additionally, if the input string contains only '?' characters, and their count is evenly divisible by 4, the function will also replace them with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in that order, up to `n // 4` occurrences each. The function's behavior implies that it assumes the input will always be provided in the standard format of two lines: the first line containing the integer `n`, and the second line containing the string `s`.
