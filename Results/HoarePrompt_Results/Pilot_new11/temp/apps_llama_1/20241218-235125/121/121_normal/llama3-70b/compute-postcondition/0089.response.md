The given Python code snippet is `print('===')`. This code simply prints the string '===' to the console. It does not modify any variables or affect the state of the program in any way. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each key's value is adjusted based on replacements made for '?', `c` is the last character in `s`, and `res` contains the modified string from `s` with '?' replaced based on availability in `count` and 'ACGT', and '===' has been printed to the console.
