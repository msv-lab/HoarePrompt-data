To determine the output state of the loop, we need to analyze the loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```
for c in s:
    if c!= '?':
        count[c] += 1
```
The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values 0.

From the output states after a few iterations, we can see that:
- If `c` is not '?', then `count[c]` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is '?', then the state of `count` remains unchanged.
- The loop will execute at least once if `s` is a string with at least 1 character.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `count` will contain the count of each character 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' in the string `s`. If a character is not present in `s`, its count will remain 0.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is the count of the corresponding character in `s`.**
