The value of `high` is updated to `mid`, where `mid = (low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `mid` is the average of `low` and `high`, and `high` is updated to `mid`, the new value of `high` is less than or equal to the old value of `high`. The condition `low < high` is still valid because `mid` is greater than or equal to `low` due to the integer division. The relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `2 <= n <= a + b`, `low < high`, and `mid = (low + high) // 2`, `high = mid`**
