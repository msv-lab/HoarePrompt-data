The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `low` was 1, but it has been changed. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 2 <= `n` <= `a` + `b`, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and `low` is `mid + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 2 <= `n` <= `a` + `b`, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`, and `low` is `mid + 1`.**
