Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `2 <= n <= a + b`, `low < high`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is true, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, altering the relationship between `low`, `high`, and `mid`. If `can_distribute(mid)` is false, then `high` is updated to `mid`, also altering the relationship between `low`, `high`, and `mid`.***
