The function `can_distribute` accepts parameters `a`, `b`, `n`, and `x`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of plates, and `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces per plate. After executing the function body, the function returns `True` if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces from cakes `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `False` otherwise.
