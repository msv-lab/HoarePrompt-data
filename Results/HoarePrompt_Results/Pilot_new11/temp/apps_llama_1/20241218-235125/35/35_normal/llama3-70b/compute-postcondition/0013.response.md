Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with values determined by the user's input, potentially adhering to the constraints 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `x` is the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b` minus 2, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` and `b` is greater than or equal to `x` and the sum of `a` minus `x` and `b` minus `x` is greater than or equal to `x`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle other conditions.**
