To find the output state, we'll consider the given information and the effect of the code snippet `return low - 1`.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `low` equals `high`.
- `low` represents the smallest number of pieces per plate for which `can_distribute` starts to consistently return True.

The code `return low - 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `low`. 

Since `low` is the smallest number of pieces per plate where distribution is consistently possible (as indicated by `can_distribute` returning True), subtracting 1 from `low` gives us the number of pieces per plate right before the distribution becomes consistently possible.

Output State: **The program returns the number of pieces per plate that is one less than the smallest number of pieces per plate for which distribution is consistently possible, with `n`, `a`, and `b` retaining their original meanings.**
