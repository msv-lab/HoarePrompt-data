Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. The issue lies in the condition inside the while loop: `if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x`. This condition does not correctly represent the constraints given in the problem description.

According to the problem description, each piece of each cake is put on some plate, each plate contains at least one piece of cake, and no plate contains pieces of both cakes. The condition in the while loop should ensure that the cakes can be distributed in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

However, the condition `a - x + (b - x) >= x` is incorrect. It should be `a + b - 2*x >= n - 2` or `(a-x) + (b-x) >= n - 2` to ensure that there are enough cake pieces left to distribute among the remaining plates.

A correct condition would be: 
```
if a >= x and b >= x and (a-x) + (b-x) >= n - 2:
```
This condition ensures that at least two plates can have x pieces each, and the remaining cakes can be distributed among the remaining plates, with each plate having at least one piece of cake.

Additionally, the initial value of x should be `min(a//((n+1)//2), b//((n+1)//2))` instead of `min(n, a, b)` to start with a more reasonable estimate for the maximum x.

The corrected code would be:
```
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
x = min(a//((n+1)//2), b//((n+1)//2))
while True:
    if a >= x and b >= x and (a-x) + (b-x) >= n - 2:
        break
    x -= 1
print(x)
```
This code ensures that each plate will have at least x pieces of cake, and it correctly follows the problem description.
