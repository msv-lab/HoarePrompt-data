To solve this, we need to understand that `max_len` is being compared to the length of `substr`, which is known to be 2 since `substr` is defined as `s[2:4]`, a substring of length 2. The initial state of `max_len` is not provided, so we'll consider its impact based on the given code.

Given that `substr` is a string of length 2, `len(substr)` equals 2. The code updates `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `substr` is `s[2:4]`, a string of length 2 containing lowercase English letters, and `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 2**
