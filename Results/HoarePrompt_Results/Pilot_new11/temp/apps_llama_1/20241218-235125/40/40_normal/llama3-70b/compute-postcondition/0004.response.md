According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `n` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, and is equal to the input string, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `i`, and since `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, which is already given. `j` will take values from `i + 1` to `n` (inclusive), so `j` will start from 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, and is equal to the input string, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than `i`**
