Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `substr` is `s[1:2]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1. Otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged.**
