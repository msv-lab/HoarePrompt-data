Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It checks all possible substrings of the input string to find the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring. If no such substring exists (i.e., all substrings are palindromes), it prints 0.

The code handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly:

- For the input "mew", it prints 3, which is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring "mew".
- For the input "wuffuw", it prints 5, which is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring "uffuw".
- For the input "qqqqqqqq", it prints 0, which is correct because all substrings of this string are palindromes.

Since the code checks all possible substrings and correctly handles the provided examples, and assuming that the input will always be a non-empty string of at most 50 lowercase English letters (as stated in the problem description), the code works correctly for every potential case. 

The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, and there are no mentioned cases where the code does not work as expected in the description. 

Therefore, the code's correctness is True.
