You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr != substr[::-1]:
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
    print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates over all possible substrings of the input string and checks if each substring is a palindrome. If it finds a non-palindrome substring, it updates the maximum length of such substrings.

Here's why the program is correct:

- It correctly checks all possible substrings of the input string by using two nested loops to generate all possible substring start and end indices.
- It correctly checks if a substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`substr!= substr[::-1]`).
- It correctly updates the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings by using the `max` function to compare the current maximum length with the length of the current non-palindrome substring.
- It correctly prints the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings, or 0 if no such substrings exist.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

- Empty strings: The program will not crash or produce incorrect results for empty strings, although this case is not specified in the problem description.
- Single-character strings: The program will correctly output 0 for single-character strings, since a single character is always a palindrome.
- Strings with only one unique character: The program will correctly output 0 for such strings, since all substrings will be palindromes.
- Strings with multiple unique characters: The program will correctly output the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings.

Since the program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description, it is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit input parameters, but it is expected to read a non-empty string s from the standard input, where s has a length of at most 50 characters and contains only lowercase English letters.
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr != substr[::-1]:
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is `n-1`, and `max_len` is the maximum length of all non-palindromic substrings of `s`, or 0 if all substrings are palindromes.
    print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string of at most 50 lowercase English letters from the standard input, checks all possible substrings, and prints the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring if one exists; otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or contains non-lowercase English letters, as it assumes the input will always meet the specified criteria. After execution, the program's state includes the input string `s`, its length `n`, the length of the longest non-palindromic substring `max_len` (if any), and the printed result, which is either `max_len` if a non-palindromic substring exists or 0 if all substrings are palindromes. The function does not modify the input string or persist any output beyond printing the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
