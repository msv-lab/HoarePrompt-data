Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than `i`, and `substr` is the first character of `s`. The current value of `substr` is not a palindrome, meaning `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr!= substr[::-1]`)**
