You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from the left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings "kek", "abacaba", "r" and "papicipap" are palindromes, while the strings "abb" and "iq" are not.

A substring $s[l \ldots r]$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$) of a string $s = s_{1}s_{2} \ldots s_{|s|}$ is the string $s_{l}s_{l + 1} \ldots s_{r}$.

Anna does not like palindromes, so she makes her friends call her Ann. She also changes all the words she reads in a similar way. Namely, each word $s$ is changed into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all the substrings of $s$ are palindromes, she skips the word at all.

Some time ago Ann read the word $s$. What is the word she changed it into?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-empty string $s$ with length at most $50$ characters, containing lowercase English letters only.


-----Output-----

If there is such a substring in $s$ that is not a palindrome, print the maximum length of such a substring. Otherwise print $0$.

Note that there can be multiple longest substrings that are not palindromes, but their length is unique.


-----Examples-----
Input
mew

Output
3

Input
wuffuw

Output
5

Input
qqqqqqqq

Output
0



-----Note-----

"mew" is not a palindrome, so the longest substring of it that is not a palindrome, is the string "mew" itself. Thus, the answer for the first example is $3$.

The string "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings (of length $5$) of the string "wuffuw", so the answer for the second example is $5$.

All substrings of the string "qqqqqqqq" consist of equal characters so they are palindromes. This way, there are no non-palindrome substrings. Thus, the answer for the third example is $0$.
Program:
```
s = input().strip()
if len(s) <= 1:
    print(0)
elif not func_1(s):
    print(len(s))
elif not func_1(s[1:]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
elif not func_1(s[:-1]):
    print(len(s) - 1)
else:
    print(0)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The current implementation only checks if the input string or its substring (after removing the first or last character) is a palindrome, and if not, it returns the length of that string. However, this approach does not guarantee that the returned substring is the longest one that is not a palindrome.

A counterexample is the string "abba". The program will return 3, because the substring "abb" is not a palindrome. However, the longest substring that is not a palindrome is actually "ab" and "ba", both of length 2. Since all the substrings of "abba" that are not palindromes have length 2, the program should return 2, not 3.

The program needs to be modified to correctly find the longest substring that is not a palindrome. This can be done by checking all possible substrings of the input string and keeping track of the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring. 

For example, a correct solution would involve checking every possible substring of the string, and if a substring is not a palindrome, updating the maximum length if necessary. Here is a simple example of how this could be done:
```python
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def max_length_non_palindrome(s):
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if not func_1(substr):
                max_len = max(max_len, j - i)
    return max_len

s = input().strip()
print(max_length_non_palindrome(s))
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` determines whether a given non-empty string `s` of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, is a palindrome. It returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating the result of this check. The function's input string `s` remains unchanged throughout its execution, and it handles all possible cases of palindrome checks for strings within the specified constraints, including single-character strings (which are always palindromes), strings of even length, and strings of odd length, without any additional error handling for cases outside these specified constraints (e.g., empty strings, strings longer than 50 characters, or strings containing non-lowercase characters). If the string `s` meets the criteria of being a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same backward as forward), the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
