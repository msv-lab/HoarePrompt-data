Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `substr` is a string of length 1 equal to the third character of `s`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1; otherwise, `max_len` remains unchanged.**
