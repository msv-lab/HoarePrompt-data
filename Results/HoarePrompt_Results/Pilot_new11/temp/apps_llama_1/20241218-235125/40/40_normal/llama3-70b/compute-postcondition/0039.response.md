According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `n` is between 3 and 50 (inclusive), but for the loop to execute `j` must be less than `n + 1`, meaning `n` must be at least 4 for `j` to be 4. Since `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1, `j` will be 4 in the next iteration. Also, `i` remains unchanged as per the given loop.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
