Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `substr` (the first character of `s`) is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is 1. Since there is no else part, if `substr` is a palindrome, the state of `max_len` is not updated and remains 0.***
