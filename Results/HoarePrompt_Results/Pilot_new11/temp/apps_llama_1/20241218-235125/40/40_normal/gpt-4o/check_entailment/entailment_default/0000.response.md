Correctness: **True**

The code provided checks for the longest substring of a given string that is not a palindrome. It first checks if the string itself is not a palindrome, in which case it returns the length of the string. If the string is a palindrome, it checks if the substring without the first or last character is not a palindrome, in which case it returns the length of the string minus one. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 0.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. The main part of the code then uses this function to check for the longest non-palindrome substring. 

The code also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the length of the string is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns 0 because a single character or an empty string is always a palindrome.

The code also works for the examples provided in the problem description. For example, for the input "mew", the function `func_1` returns False, so the code prints 3, which is the length of the string. For the input "wuffuw", the function `func_1` returns False, but when it checks the substrings "uffuw" and "wuffu", they are not palindromes, so it prints 5. For the input "qqqqqqqq", the function `func_1` returns True, and all substrings are also palindromes, so it prints 0.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and works for all the potential cases.
