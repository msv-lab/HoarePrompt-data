The code `substr = s[i:j]` assigns a substring of `s` to the variable `substr`. The substring starts at index `i` and ends at index `j`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. 

Since `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters and contains only lowercase English letters, the substring `s[0:1]` will be a string of length 1, containing the first character of `s`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `max_len` is still 0, `i` is still 0, and `j` is still 1. 

The condition that `n` must be greater than `i` is still valid since `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than `i`, and `substr` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than `i`, and `substr` is the first character of `s`.**
