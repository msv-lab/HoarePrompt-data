The code introduces a new variable `max_len` and assigns it the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `s` is still a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters and contains only lowercase English letters, and is equal to the input string. 
The value of `n` is still the length of `s` and is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive).
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length of at most 50 characters, contains only lowercase English letters, and is equal to the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `max_len` is 0**
