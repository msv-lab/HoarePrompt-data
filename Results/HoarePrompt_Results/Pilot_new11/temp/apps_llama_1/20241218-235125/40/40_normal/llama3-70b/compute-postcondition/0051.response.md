Functionality: **The function reads a string of at most 50 lowercase English letters from the standard input, checks all possible substrings, and prints the maximum length of a non-palindromic substring if one exists; otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or contains non-lowercase English letters, as it assumes the input will always meet the specified criteria. After execution, the program's state includes the input string `s`, its length `n`, the length of the longest non-palindromic substring `max_len` (if any), and the printed result, which is either `max_len` if a non-palindromic substring exists or 0 if all substrings are palindromes. The function does not modify the input string or persist any output beyond printing the result.**
