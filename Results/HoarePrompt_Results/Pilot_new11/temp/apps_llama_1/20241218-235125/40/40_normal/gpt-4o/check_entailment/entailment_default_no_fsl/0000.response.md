Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not handle all the cases as described in the problem description. For example, consider the string "abba". The longest non-palindrome substring of "abba" is "abb" which has a length of 3. However, the code will return 4 because it checks if the entire string is a palindrome and then checks the substrings without the first and last characters. 

This code only checks the substring without the first character, the substring without the last character, and the entire string itself. It does not check all possible substrings of the given string. Therefore, it may not always return the correct maximum length of a non-palindrome substring. 

To correctly solve the problem, the code should iterate over all possible substrings of the given string, check if each substring is a palindrome, and keep track of the maximum length of non-palindrome substrings. 

Here is an example of an incorrect execution:

Input:
abba

Expected Output:
3

Actual Output:
4 

In this case, the longest non-palindrome substring is "abb" which has a length of 3, but the code returns 4 which is the length of the string itself. This shows that the code does not handle all the cases as described in the problem description.
