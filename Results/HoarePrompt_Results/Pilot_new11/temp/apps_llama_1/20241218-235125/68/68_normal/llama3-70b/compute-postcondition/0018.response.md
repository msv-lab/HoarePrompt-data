The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, the program takes three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, `z` as input, where `x`, `y`, `z` represent the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or vote with unknown outcome, respectively, with the constraints 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100.


Since the output description is missing, I'll provide a general format for the functionality based on typical expectations for such a function. Normally, the output could depend on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, potentially returning a message or value indicating the outcome of the votes (e.g., "upvote wins," "downvote wins," "tie," or a specific outcome based on `z`). Without the specific output description, the functionality can be described as follows:


Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates on three non-negative integer inputs x, y, z, representing upvotes, downvotes, and unknown outcome votes, and returns an outcome based on these inputs.**
