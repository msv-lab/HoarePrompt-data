The given code simply prints a '?' character and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` equals `y`, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `z` is greater than 0, `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100), and a '?' has been printed**
