To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `z` is an input integer
- `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`
- `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`
- `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`

The code introduces a new variable `max_downvotes` and assigns it the value of `y + z`.

Given this, the output state will include all the variables from the initial state plus the new `max_downvotes` variable. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Only `max_downvotes` is added.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `z` is an input integer
- `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`
- `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`
- `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`
- `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`**
