It seems there is a mistake in the provided problem. The function definition is given as `def func():`, which means it does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `x`, `y`, and `z` as non-negative integers. 

Assuming the function should accept these parameters, the correct function definition should be `def func(x, y, z):`. Based on this assumption, here's the description of the function's functionality:

The function `func` accepts parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. 

Since the output cases are not provided, we cannot determine the specific return values based on the input parameters. Normally, we would describe the return values for each case, but without this information, we can only acknowledge that the function takes in three parameters with specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x, y, and z, which are non-negative integers between 0 and 100.**
