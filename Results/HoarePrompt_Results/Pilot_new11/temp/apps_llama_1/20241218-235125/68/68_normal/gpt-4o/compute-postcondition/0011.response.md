The provided Python code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs a question mark ('?'). This statement does not modify any variables or their relationships. It merely performs an output operation.

Therefore, after executing this statement, all the variables retain their initial values and relationships as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, and '?' has been printed.**
