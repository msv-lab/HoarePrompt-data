Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y, z <= 100), if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '+' has been printed. If `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, then if `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen (-) has been printed; if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, the state of `x`, `y`, and `z` remains as is, otherwise, if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, or if `x` is greater than `y`, a '?' has been printed, with `x`, `y`, and `z` remaining non-negative integers and `x` being either equal to or greater than `y`.**
