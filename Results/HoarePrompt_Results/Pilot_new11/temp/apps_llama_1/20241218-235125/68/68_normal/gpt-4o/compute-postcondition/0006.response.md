The code provided prints a '-' character. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. The initial state variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` retain their values. The relationship between `max_upvotes` and `min_downvotes` also remains unchanged, where `x + z` is less than `y`. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and `x + z` is less than `y`.**
