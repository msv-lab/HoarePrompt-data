The code increments the in-degree of vertex `v` by 1. The in-degree of `v` was previously updated to reflect the in-degrees of all vertices directly reachable from the new `u`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The `graph` is still a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one more vertex, `n` is still at least 2, `u` is still the next vertex in `graph`, `v` is still the first adjacent vertex of the new `u`, and `graph[u]` is still not empty.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one more vertex, `n` is at least 2, `u` is the next vertex in `graph`, `v` is the first adjacent vertex of the new `u`, `graph[u]` is not empty, `in_degree` has values updated to reflect the in-degrees of all vertices directly reachable from the new `u`, except for `in_degree[v]` which is now `in_degree[v] + 1`.**
