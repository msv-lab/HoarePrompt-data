The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the in-degree of vertex `v` by 1. Given that `in_degree[v]` was initially 1, it will now become 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one vertex, `n` is at least 1, `in_degree` has all values as 0 except `in_degree[v]` which is now 2, `u` is a vertex in `graph` and `graph[u]` must have at least 2 vertices, `v` is the second vertex in `graph[u]`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with at least one vertex, `n` is at least 1, `in_degree` has all values as 0 except `in_degree[v]` which is 2, `u` is a vertex in `graph` and `graph[u]` must have at least 2 vertices, `v` is the second vertex in `graph[u]`.**
