The given code creates a queue and inserts all nodes from the `in_degree` dictionary that have an in-degree of 0. This means all nodes with no incoming edges are added to the queue.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the original number of vertices in the graph, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph and each value is the actual in-degree of that vertex, and `queue` is a deque containing all nodes in `in_degree` with an in-degree of 0**
