The code `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. Since `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`, if `in_degree[neighbor] - 1` is 0, `neighbor` is added to the `queue`. The `graph` remains the same, `n` is unchanged, and `in_degree` is updated as before. The `count` can be any number and remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph including `node` and each value is the updated in-degree of that vertex, `queue` contains either the same number of nodes as before with a new `neighbor` as the rightmost node if `in_degree[neighbor] - 1` is 0, or one less node than before, `count` is any number, and `node` has at least one more neighbor in `graph[node]`, and `queue` now includes `neighbor` as its rightmost node if `in_degree[neighbor]` became 0**
