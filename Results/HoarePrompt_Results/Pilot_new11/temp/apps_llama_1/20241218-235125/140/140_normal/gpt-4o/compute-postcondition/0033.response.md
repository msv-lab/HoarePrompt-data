Postcondition: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph where `node` is a key with at least one neighbor, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the original number of vertices in the graph, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph including `node` and each value is the updated in-degree of that vertex with `in_degree[neighbor]` decremented by 1, `queue` contains one less node than before and is not empty, `count` is any number, and `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue`. The current value of `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0**
