You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        graph[u].append(v)
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately checks if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The `func_1` function takes in the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a list of edges.
2. It constructs a graph using a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.
3. The `has_cycle` function checks if the graph contains a cycle. It does this by calculating the in-degree of each vertex and using a queue to perform a topological sort. If all vertices are visited during the sort, then the graph does not contain a cycle.
4. If the graph does not contain a cycle initially, the function returns 'YES'.
5. If the graph contains a cycle, the function iterates over each edge and temporarily removes it from the graph. It then checks if the graph is acyclic. If it is, the function returns 'YES'.
6. If removing any single edge does not make the graph acyclic, the function returns 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Graphs with no cycles
* Graphs with a single cycle that can be removed by deleting one edge
* Graphs with multiple cycles that cannot be made acyclic by deleting one edge

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `has_cycle` checks if a directed graph contains nodes that are not reachable from the initial set of nodes with an in-degree of 0. It accepts a dictionary `graph` representing a directed graph and an implicit integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the graph, where each key in the dictionary is a vertex and its corresponding value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has a directed edge to. The function returns `True` if the graph contains nodes that are not reachable from the initial set of nodes with an in-degree of 0, indicating the presence of a cycle or disconnected nodes; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles all potential cases, including empty graphs, graphs with multiple connected components, and graphs with no nodes having an in-degree of 0. However, it assumes that the input graph is a valid dictionary representation of a directed graph and does not contain any self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. The function's return value indicates whether the graph contains a cycle or has disconnected nodes, but does not provide any information about the specific cycle or disconnected nodes.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
