Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `graph[node]` is a list of neighbors with at least one less neighbor to process, `n` is a non-negative integer, `node` is the same node, `count` is consistent with the processing of one more neighbor of the `node` in the `graph`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, `queue` contains nodes with updated in-degrees including the newly added `neighbor`.***
