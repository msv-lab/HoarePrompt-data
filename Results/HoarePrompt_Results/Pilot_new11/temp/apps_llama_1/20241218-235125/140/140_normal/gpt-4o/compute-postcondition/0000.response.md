The given code creates a new dictionary `in_degree` where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and each value is initialized to 0. This dictionary will be used to store the in-degree of each vertex in the graph.

The initial state is: `graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and `n`) and each value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has a directed edge to, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.

After executing the code, the state of `graph` and `n` remains unchanged. However, a new dictionary `in_degree` is created, where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and each value is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a vertex (an integer between 1 and `n`) and each value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has a directed edge to, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and each value is 0.**
