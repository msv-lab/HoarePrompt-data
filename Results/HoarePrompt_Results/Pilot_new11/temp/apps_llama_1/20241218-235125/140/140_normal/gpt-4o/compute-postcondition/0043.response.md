Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a non-negative integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex in the graph including `node` and each value is the updated in-degree of that vertex except for `neighbor` which is decremented by 1, `count` is any number, `node` has at least one more neighbor in `graph[node]`, and if `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` contains `neighbor`.***
