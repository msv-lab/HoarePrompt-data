According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the neighbors of the current node in the graph. If the current node has at least one neighbor that has not been processed yet, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `node` is the node that was just removed from the `queue` and has at least one neighbor in `graph`. For the loop to execute one more time, `node` must have at least one more neighbor in `graph` that has not been processed yet.

State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees of all vertices after processing, `queue` does not contain the last node that was processed, `node` has at least one more neighbor in `graph`, `count` is unchanged because it is not dependent on the loop**
