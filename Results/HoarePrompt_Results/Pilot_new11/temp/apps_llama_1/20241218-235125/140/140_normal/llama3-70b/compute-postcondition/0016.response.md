Postcondition: **`node` is a valid vertex in the graph, `graph` is an adjacency list or matrix representing a directed graph where `graph[node]` has at least two neighbors, `visited` is a list or set of integers where `visited[node]` is `True`, and `rec_stack` is a list or set of integers representing the current recursion stack where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If the second neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]` is in the recursion stack, the program returns True, indicating a valid result for a node in the graph with at least two neighbors, where the current node has been visited and is in the recursion stack. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.**
