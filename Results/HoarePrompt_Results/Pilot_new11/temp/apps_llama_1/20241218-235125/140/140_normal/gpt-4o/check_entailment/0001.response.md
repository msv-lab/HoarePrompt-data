Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately checks if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. The `func_1` function takes in the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a list of edges.
2. It constructs a graph using a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.
3. The `has_cycle` function checks if the graph contains a cycle. It does this by calculating the in-degree of each vertex and using a queue to perform a topological sort. If all vertices are visited during the sort, then the graph does not contain a cycle.
4. If the graph does not contain a cycle initially, the function returns 'YES'.
5. If the graph contains a cycle, the function iterates over each edge and temporarily removes it from the graph. It then checks if the graph is acyclic. If it is, the function returns 'YES'.
6. If removing any single edge does not make the graph acyclic, the function returns 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Graphs with no cycles
* Graphs with a single cycle that can be removed by deleting one edge
* Graphs with multiple cycles that cannot be made acyclic by deleting one edge

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
