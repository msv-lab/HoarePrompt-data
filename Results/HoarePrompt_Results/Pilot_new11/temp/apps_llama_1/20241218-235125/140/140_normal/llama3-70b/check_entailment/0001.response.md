Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem asks if it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, but the given program only checks if the graph is already acyclic. If the graph contains a cycle, the program immediately returns 'NO', without checking if removing one edge can make the graph acyclic.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all edges in the graph, temporarily remove each edge, and check if the resulting graph is acyclic. If we find an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, we can return 'YES'. If we check all edges and none of them makes the graph acyclic, we return 'NO'.

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)

def has_cycle(graph):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
    for node in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[node]:
            if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
    return False

def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False

for u in range(1, n + 1):
    for v in graph[u][:]:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            print('YES')
            break
        graph[u].append(v)
    else:
        continue
    break
else:
    print('NO')
```

This implementation first checks if the original graph has a cycle. If it does not, it prints 'YES'. If it does, it iterates over all edges in the graph, temporarily removes each edge, and checks if the resulting graph has a cycle. If it finds an edge whose removal makes the graph acyclic, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. If it checks all edges and none of them makes the graph acyclic, it prints 'NO'.
