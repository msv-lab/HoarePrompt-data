Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph with `n` vertices, `in_degree` reflects the updated in-degrees with `in_degree[neighbor]` = `in_degree[neighbor]` - 1, `node` has at least one more neighbor in `graph`, `count` remains unchanged, and if `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` contains the `neighbor` node in addition to its previous elements***
