Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. The program checks if the graph is acyclic and prints "NO" if it finds a cycle, but it does not check if removing an edge would make the graph acyclic.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the graph has a cycle, and if it does, it prints "NO" without considering whether removing an edge could make the graph acyclic. To solve this problem, the program should iterate over all edges and check if removing each edge would make the graph acyclic.

For example, consider a graph with 3 nodes and 3 edges: 1->2, 2->3, 3->1. The program would correctly identify that this graph has a cycle and print "NO". However, if we add one more edge 1->3, the program would still print "NO", even though removing the edge 3->1 would make the graph acyclic.

To fix this, the program should be modified to iterate over all edges, remove each edge temporarily, and then check if the resulting graph is acyclic. If it finds an edge that, when removed, makes the graph acyclic, it should print "YES". If it checks all edges and none of them make the graph acyclic when removed, it should print "NO". 

Here is a high-level idea of how the modified program could look:

```python
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)

def has_cycle(graph):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
    for node in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[node]:
            if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
    return False

def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False

def remove_edge(graph, u, v):
    new_graph = [row[:] for row in graph]
    new_graph[u] = [x for x in new_graph[u] if x!= v]
    return new_graph

for u in range(1, n + 1):
    for v in graph[u]:
        new_graph = remove_edge(graph, u, v)
        if not has_cycle(new_graph):
            print("YES")
            exit()

print("NO")
```
