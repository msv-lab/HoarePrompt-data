Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it only checks if `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, but it does not consider the total number of opening and closing brackets.

A regular bracket sequence can be formed if and only if the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets, and at any point in the sequence, the number of opening brackets is greater than or equal to the number of closing brackets.

In the given program, if `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, it prints 1, indicating that a regular bracket sequence can be formed. However, this is not always true.

For example, if `cnt1` is 1, `cnt2` is 0, `cnt3` is 1, and `cnt4` is 1, the program will print 1, but it is not possible to form a regular bracket sequence because the total number of opening brackets (2) is less than the total number of closing brackets (4).

A correct solution would need to consider the total number of opening and closing brackets, and check if it is possible to arrange the strings to form a regular bracket sequence. 

One possible correct solution is to check if `cnt1 + cnt2` is equal to `cnt3 + cnt4`, because the total number of opening brackets is `cnt1 + cnt2` and the total number of closing brackets is `cnt3 + cnt4`. Additionally, it needs to check if `cnt1` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`, because in a regular bracket sequence, the number of opening brackets should be greater than or equal to the number of closing brackets at any point. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4 = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt1 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
```
