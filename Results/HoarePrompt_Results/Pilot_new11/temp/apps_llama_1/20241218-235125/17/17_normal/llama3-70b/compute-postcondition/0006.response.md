## Step 1: Identify the parameters and their constraints.
The function `func` takes no arguments, but it uses four non-negative integers `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` as inputs, which are read from the input in the given order. Each of these integers represents the number of strings of a specific type.

## Step 2: Determine the return value based on the given output description.
Since the problem description does not specify the output based on conditions related to the input integers `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, we cannot define specific return values for different cases. Therefore, the return value or the functionality of the function cannot be precisely determined without further details on how these inputs influence the output.

## Step 3: Consider any specific conditions or cases that might affect the return value.
Given the lack of specific conditions or cases in the problem description related to the output, we can only acknowledge that the function uses the four input integers but cannot detail how they affect the output without additional information.

The final answer is: Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but uses four non-negative integers cnt_1, cnt_2, cnt_3, and cnt_4 as inputs and returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return values or conditions are not specified.**
