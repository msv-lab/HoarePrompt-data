Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all cases correctly. The condition `if cnt3 > cnt1` is not sufficient to determine if a regular bracket sequence can be formed. 

A counterexample is when `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 1`, `cnt3 = 0`, and `cnt4 = 0`. In this case, the program will print `1`, but it's actually not possible to form a regular bracket sequence because we have one "(" and one ")" which can form a valid sequence but the condition in the code is not checking this. 

However, a more relevant example is when `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, and `cnt4 = 1`. In this case, the program will print `1`, but it's actually not possible to form a regular bracket sequence because we have one ")(" and one "))" which cannot form a valid sequence.

The correct condition should also consider the total count of opening and closing brackets. A regular bracket sequence can be formed if and only if the total count of opening brackets is equal to the total count of closing brackets, and at any point in the sequence, the count of opening brackets is greater than or equal to the count of closing brackets. 

The provided code does not check these conditions, so it's incorrect. A more complex algorithm or condition is needed to solve this problem correctly.
