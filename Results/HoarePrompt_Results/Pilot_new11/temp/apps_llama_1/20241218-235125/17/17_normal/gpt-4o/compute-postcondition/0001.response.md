The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `cnt_2`. This means `cnt_2` is now an input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers**
