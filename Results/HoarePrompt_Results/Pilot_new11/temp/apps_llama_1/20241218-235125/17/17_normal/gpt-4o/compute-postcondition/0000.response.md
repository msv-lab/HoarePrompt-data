The code `cnt1 = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `cnt1`. The initial state mentions four non-negative integers, `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, but the code only updates the value of `cnt1`. Assuming `cnt1` is equivalent to `cnt_1` due to a possible typo in the variable name, the value of `cnt1` (or `cnt_1`) becomes an input integer. The states of the other variables, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`cnt1` (or `cnt_1`) is an input integer, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers**
