Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. The condition `cnt3 > cnt1` is sufficient to determine whether a regular bracket sequence can be formed, but it is not necessary. 

A correct approach would be to check if the number of opening brackets is equal to the number of closing brackets and if at any point the number of closing brackets exceeds the number of opening brackets. 

The given code only checks if the count of the third type is greater than the count of the first type, but it does not consider the counts of the second and fourth types. It ignores the fact that each string of type 2 contributes one opening and one closing bracket, while each string of type 1 contributes two opening brackets and each string of type 4 contributes two closing brackets.

For example, the input `1 0 0 1` would result in the output `1`, but the correct output should be `0` because the number of opening brackets is not equal to the number of closing brackets. 

The code does not correctly handle cases where the counts of the second and fourth types are not equal to zero. It only checks if the count of the third type is greater than the count of the first type, which is not a sufficient condition to determine whether a regular bracket sequence can be formed.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
