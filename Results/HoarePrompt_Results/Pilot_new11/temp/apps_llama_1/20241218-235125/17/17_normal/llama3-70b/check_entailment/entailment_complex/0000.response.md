Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the condition for forming a regular bracket sequence from the given strings. 

To form a regular bracket sequence, the number of opening brackets must always be greater than or equal to the number of closing brackets at any point in the sequence. 

The strings can be considered as follows:
- `cnt1` strings "((" contribute +2 to the opening bracket count,
- `cnt2` strings "()" contribute +1 to the opening bracket count and +1 to the closing bracket count, so they do not change the balance,
- `cnt3` strings ")(" contribute +1 to the closing bracket count and then +1 to the opening bracket count, so they decrease the balance by 1, and
- `cnt4` strings "))" contribute +2 to the closing bracket count.

The only way to have a regular bracket sequence is if the decrease in balance caused by `cnt3` can be compensated by the increase in balance caused by `cnt1`. 

If `cnt3 > cnt1`, then there is no way to arrange the strings to form a regular bracket sequence, because the decrease in balance caused by `cnt3` will always be greater than the increase in balance caused by `cnt1`. 

On the other hand, if `cnt3 <= cnt1`, then it is possible to arrange the strings in a way that maintains a non-negative balance throughout the sequence, which means a regular bracket sequence can be formed.

The program checks exactly this condition: if `cnt3 > cnt1`, it prints 0 (indicating that it is not possible to form a regular bracket sequence), otherwise it prints 1 (indicating that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence). 

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
