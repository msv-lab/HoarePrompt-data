The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is unknown, so the output state is: `left` is increased by 1. 
The states of the other variables are not affected, so `sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sofas, `s` is the third sofa in the `sofas` list.
Output State: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sofas, `s` is the third sofa in the `sofas` list, `left` is increased by 1**
