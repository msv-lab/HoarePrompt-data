Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, if `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count[1]` is the original count plus 1, if `x1` > `x2_j` and `x2` > `x2_j`, then `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where the element at index `i` is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions plus 1 and the other elements remain unchanged, otherwise `left_count` remains unchanged, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where each element is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where the element at index `i` is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions plus 1, otherwise `right_count` remains unchanged, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the second tuple of `sofas`, `x1_j` is `x1`, `y1_j` is `y1`, `x2_j` is `x2`, `y2_j` is `y2`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `bottom_count[1]` is `bottom_count[1]` plus 1, otherwise `bottom_count` remains unchanged, otherwise all the lists remain unchanged.***
