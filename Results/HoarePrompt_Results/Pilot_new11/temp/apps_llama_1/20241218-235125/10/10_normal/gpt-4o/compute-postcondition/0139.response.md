Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is the next index plus one, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are input integers corresponding to the `(j+1)-th` tuple in `sofas`. If `i` equals `j`, then `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` remain unchanged and we move to the next iteration of the loop. If `i` does not equal `j`, the postcondition is undefined in this case since there is no else part, but based on the given information, the original values and the loop body would dictate the changes to `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` when `i` is not equal to `j`.***
