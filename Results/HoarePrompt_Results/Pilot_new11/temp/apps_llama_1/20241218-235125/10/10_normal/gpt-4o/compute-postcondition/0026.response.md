The code `right_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `right_count` at index `i` by 1. 

Given the initial state, we know that `d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 0 or `i` and `j` are not equal and we stay in the current iteration of the loop, initially `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the `j`-th tuple of `sofas`. The current values of `x1` and `x2` are such that `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.

The state of all the variables remains the same except for `right_count[i]` which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `bottom_count` is a list of at least `d` integers, `i` and `j` are either both 0 or `i` and `j` are not equal and we stay in the current iteration of the loop, initially `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the `j`-th tuple of `sofas`, `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.**
