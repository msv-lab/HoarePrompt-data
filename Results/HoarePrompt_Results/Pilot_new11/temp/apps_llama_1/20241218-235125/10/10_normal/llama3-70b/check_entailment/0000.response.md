Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for every potential case because the `func_1` function only considers the position of the first cell of each sofa when comparing them, but the problem description states that a sofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_a < x_b, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. This means that the function should consider both cells of each sofa, not just the first one.

For example, if we have two sofas with coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2) and (2, 1), (3, 1) respectively, the function will incorrectly determine that the first sofa is to the left of the second sofa, because it only compares the x-coordinates of the first cells of the two sofas, which are both 1.

To fix this, the function should be modified to consider both cells of each sofa when comparing them. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
            other_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            for cell in cells:
                for other_cell in other_cells:
                    if cell[0] < other_cell[0]:
                        left += 1
                    elif cell[0] > other_cell[0]:
                        right += 1
                    if cell[1] < other_cell[1]:
                        top += 1
                    elif cell[1] > other_cell[1]:
                        bottom += 1
    # Avoid counting duplicates
    left = (left > 0)
    right = (right > 0)
    top = (top > 0)
    bottom = (bottom > 0)
    # Count the actual sofas
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            cells = [sofa[0], sofa[1]]
            other_cells = [s[0], s[1]]
            left_sofa = False
            right_sofa = False
            top_sofa = False
            bottom_sofa = False
            for cell in cells:
                for other_cell in other_cells:
                    if cell[0] < other_cell[0]:
                        left_sofa = True
                    elif cell[0] > other_cell[0]:
                        right_sofa = True
                    if cell[1] < other_cell[1]:
                        top_sofa = True
                    elif cell[1] > other_cell[1]:
                        bottom_sofa = True
            if left_sofa:
                left += 1
            if right_sofa:
                right += 1
            if top_sofa:
                top += 1
            if bottom_sofa:
                bottom += 1
    return (left, right, top, bottom)
```

However, this function still does not perfectly solve the problem, as it counts the same sofa multiple times if they are on the same row or column. A better approach would be to directly compare the sofas based on the conditions given in the problem description. 

One possible solution would be to create sets of sofas that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of the current sofa, and then count the number of sofas in each set. This approach would ensure that each sofa is only counted once. 

Here is a simplified and corrected version of the program:

```python
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(sofa, sofas):
    left = sum(1 for s in sofas if s!= sofa and (sofa[0][0] < s[0][0] or sofa[0][0] < s[1][0]) and (sofa[1][0] < s[0][0] or sofa[1][0] < s[1][0]))
    right = sum(1 for s in sofas if s!= sofa and (sofa[0][0] > s[0][0] or sofa[0][0] > s[1][0]) and (sofa[1][0] > s[0][0] or sofa[1][0] > s[1][0]))
    top = sum(1 for s in sofas if s!= sofa and (sofa[0][1] < s[0][1] or sofa[0][1] < s[1][1]) and (sofa[1][1] < s[0][1] or sofa[1][1] < s[1][1]))
    bottom = sum(1 for s in sofas if s!= sofa and (sofa[0][1] > s[0][1] or sofa[0][1] > s[1][1]) and (sofa[1][1] > s[0][1] or sofa[1][1] > s[1][1]))
    return (left, right, top, bottom)

for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = func_1(sofa, sofas)
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)
