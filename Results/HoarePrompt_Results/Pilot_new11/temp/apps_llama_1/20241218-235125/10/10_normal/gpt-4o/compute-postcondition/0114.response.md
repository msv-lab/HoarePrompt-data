The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 2, `right_count[2]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `right_count[2]` is increased by 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the third tuple of `sofas`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers, `right_count` is a list of at least `d` integers where `right_count[2]` is the original value of `right_count[2]` plus 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the third tuple of `sofas`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers in the first tuple of `sofas`, `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.**
