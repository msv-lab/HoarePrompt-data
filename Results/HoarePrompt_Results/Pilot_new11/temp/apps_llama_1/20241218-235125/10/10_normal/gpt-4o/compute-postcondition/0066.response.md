The given Python statement `continue` is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since the initial state does not specify any loop, the effect of `continue` cannot be directly determined. However, considering the general behavior of `continue`, it does not change the values of variables but skips to the next iteration of the loop it is inside. Without knowing the loop structure, we assume `continue` is used within a loop that iterates over the range of `d`, and `i` is the loop counter. However, since `i` equals `j` which is 0, and `continue` does not affect variable values directly, the output state remains the same as the initial state.


Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers where each element is the original count plus the number of sofas satisfying the respective conditions, `i` equals `j` which is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the second tuple of `sofas`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
