Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, and `bottom_count` are lists of at least `d` integers, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the four integers in the third tuple of `sofas`. If `i` equals `j`, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop with `i` as 2 and `j` as 0. Since `i` is initially 2 and `j` is initially 0, `i` will never equal `j`, so the program will not continue to the next iteration of the loop based on this condition, and the values of `i` and `j` will remain 2 and 0 respectively.***
