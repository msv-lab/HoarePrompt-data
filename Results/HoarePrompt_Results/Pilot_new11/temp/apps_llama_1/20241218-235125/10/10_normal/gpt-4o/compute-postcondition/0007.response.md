The code snippet assigns the input values to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` using the `map` function, which applies the `int` function to each input value. 

Previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are overwritten with the new input integer values. 

The states of the other variables `d`, `n`, `m`, `counts`, and `sofas` are not affected by this code.

However, the value of `sofas` is a list containing one tuple: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, and since `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are updated, the value of `sofas` will also be updated to `[(input integer values)]`.

But since the sofas list was not updated in the given code, the sofas will hold the old values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` which were input integers.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are new input integers, `counts` are between 0 and `d`-2, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple: `(old x1, old y1, old x2, old y2)`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are new input integers, `counts` are between 0 and `d`-2, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple: `(old input integer values)`**
