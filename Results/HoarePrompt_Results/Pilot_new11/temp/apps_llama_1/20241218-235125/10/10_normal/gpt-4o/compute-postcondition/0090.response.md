Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are equal to the `j-th` tuple elements in `sofas`. If `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is the old value of `bottom_count[i]` plus 1. Additionally, if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is the old value of `left_count[i]` plus 1. Otherwise, `left_count[i]` remains unchanged. If `y1` is not less than `y1_j` or `y2` is not less than `y1_j`, then the state remains unchanged.***
