The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change. 

The loop body is skipped for the current iteration and we move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` and `m` are input integer values, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d` tuples, each tuple containing four input integers, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is the next index plus one, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are input integers corresponding to the `(j+1)-th` tuple in `sofas`, `top_count`, `left_count`, `right_count`, and `bottom_count` remain unchanged as this iteration of the loop is skipped, and if `i` equals `j+1`, the loop skips to the next iteration.
