The function accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer, and returns the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous maximum and the current iteration number, from 1 to `n`, starting with `res = 0`. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, as no iterations of `func_1` will be performed. If `n` is 1, the function will apply `func_1` once with arguments 0 and 1, and return the result. For `n` greater than 1, the function will iteratively apply `func_1` and keep track of the maximum value obtained. Note that the function's behavior depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided in the given code. The function's return value will be the maximum value obtained after all iterations, or 0 if `n` is 0. The input variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
