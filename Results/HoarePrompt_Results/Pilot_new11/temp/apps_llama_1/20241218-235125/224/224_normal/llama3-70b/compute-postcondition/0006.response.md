The value of `dp[j]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`. Since `dp[j]` is `0` (as per the initial state, all elements of `dp` except `dp[0]` are `0`), `dp[j]` will remain `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and `f_max_n >= 1`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and all other elements are `0`, `i` is `1`, `j` is `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is `0`**
