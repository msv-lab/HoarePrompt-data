You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.


-----Output-----

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Annotated Functions:
n = int(input())
f_max_n = func_2(n)
print(func_3(n, f_max_n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns the original value of `a`, which is the GCD of `a` and 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It accepts two integers and returns their GCD. The return value is determined by the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, not the original value of `a` as stated in the annotations. The function handles all possible integer inputs for `a` and `b`, including edge cases where one or both of the inputs are 0, correctly returning the GCD in these cases. Note that when `b` is 0, the function will return the absolute value of `a`, as the GCD of `a` and 0 is defined to be `a`. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are 0, but based on the code, it will return 0, which is a reasonable definition for the GCD of 0 and 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer and greater than 1, and res is initially set to 0, which will store the maximum value among the results of function func_1.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous maximum and the current iteration number, from 1 to `n`, starting with `res = 0`.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous maximum and the current iteration number, from 1 to `n`, starting with `res = 0`, where `n` is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer, and returns the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous maximum and the current iteration number, from 1 to `n`, starting with `res = 0`. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, as no iterations of `func_1` will be performed. If `n` is 1, the function will apply `func_1` once with arguments 0 and 1, and return the result. For `n` greater than 1, the function will iteratively apply `func_1` and keep track of the maximum value obtained. Note that the function's behavior depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided in the given code. The function's return value will be the maximum value obtained after all iterations, or 0 if `n` is 0. The input variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and f_max_n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and f_max_n represents the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where each `dp[j]` (for `1 <= j <= f_max_n`) is the result of a cumulative sum process starting from the initial value `dp[0] = 1`, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo `MOD`, and `i` is equal to `n`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns the value of dp at index f_max_n, which is the cumulative sum result at the maximum value f_max_n, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` calculates the cumulative sum at index `f_max_n` in a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1`, where each element `dp[j]` represents the cumulative sum of the previous elements, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. It accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 2 and `10^6`, and `f_max_n`, the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers 1 to `n`. After executing the function, the program returns the value of `dp` at index `f_max_n`, effectively providing the result of the cumulative sum process. Note that the function does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that the input parameters are within the specified range. The function also does not handle cases where `f_max_n` is not a valid maximum value for the given `n`, or where the calculation of `dp` results in an overflow. The final state of the program is that it returns a single integer value, which is the result of the cumulative sum calculation, and does not modify any external state.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
