The value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. The previous value of `dp[j]` is the result of a cumulative sum process starting from the initial Fibonacci-like sequence, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo `MOD`. The value of `j` is `f_max_n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `3 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where each `dp[j]` (for `j > 0`) is the result of a cumulative sum process starting from the initial Fibonacci-like sequence, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo `MOD`, except for `dp[f_max_n]` which is now `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`, `i` is `3`, and `j` is `f_max_n`**
