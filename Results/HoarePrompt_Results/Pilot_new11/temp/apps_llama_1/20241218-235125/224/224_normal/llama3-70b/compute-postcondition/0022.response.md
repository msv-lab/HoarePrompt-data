To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program variables and their previous values.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0.
- `MOD` is `1000000007`.
- `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and for `j` equals to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `(3 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD`, and for all other `j` from `2` to `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD` if `j` equals `f_max_n - 2` and `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2])` for other values of `j`.
- `i` is `2`.
- `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.
- `dp[j]` equals `((2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD)`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
```

This line of code increments the value of `dp[j]` by `dp[j - 1]`. Given that `dp[j]` initially equals `((2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD)`, after execution, `dp[j]` will be:
```python
dp[j] = ((2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD) + dp[j - 1]
```

Since `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and considering the properties of modular arithmetic, the new value of `dp[j]` can be simplified, but it essentially becomes:
```python
dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD
```
Which simplifies to:
```python
dp[j] = (3 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD
```

The other variables (`n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `i`) do not change. The list `dp` changes only at the index `j`, which is `f_max_n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` must be greater than 1, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and for `j` equals to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is `(3 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD`, and for all other `j` from `2` to `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` is `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD` if `j` equals `f_max_n - 2` and now specifically `dp[f_max_n - 2]` equals `(3 * dp[f_max_n - 3] + dp[f_max_n - 4]) % MOD`, `i` is `2`, and `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.**
