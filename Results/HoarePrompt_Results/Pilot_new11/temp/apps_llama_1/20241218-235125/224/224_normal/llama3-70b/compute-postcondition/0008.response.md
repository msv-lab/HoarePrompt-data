The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. Initially, `dp[0]` is `1` and all other elements are `0`. Since `j` is `f_max_n + 1`, `dp[j - 1]` is `dp[f_max_n]` which is `0`. 

Therefore, the value of `dp[j]` which is `dp[f_max_n + 1]` becomes `0 + 0 = 0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and `f_max_n >= 2`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 2` where `dp[0]` is `1`, `dp[f_max_n + 1]` is `0` and all other elements are `0`, `i` is `1`, `j` is `f_max_n + 1`**
