To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

1. The loop statement is `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1)`. This means the loop will start from `f_max_n` and decrement `j` by 1 until it reaches 1.

2. The initial state provides information about `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `i`. However, for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement, which are `j` and `f_max_n`.

Given that `f_max_n` is the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n`, and it influences the range of the loop, we need to ensure that `f_max_n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at all. 

Since `j` starts at `f_max_n` and goes down to 1, `j` must be equal to `f_max_n` at the start of the loop.

The other variables (`n`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `i`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, given the loop statement. However, their initial states are crucial for the overall program logic and any operations within the loop body, which we don't have information about.

Therefore, considering only the information necessary for the loop to start executing, the state adjustments focus on `j` and the condition that allows the loop to run, which is inherently linked to `f_max_n` being greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` must be greater than 1, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp[j - 1]` and `dp[j - 2]`, modulo `MOD`, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `i` is `2`, `j` is `f_max_n`**
