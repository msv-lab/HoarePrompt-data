According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `f_max_n`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `f_max_n`, `f_max_n` is greater than 0, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1. So, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`. The other variables `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop condition.
State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` must be greater than 1, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and for `j` equals to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD`, and for all other `j` from `2` to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp[j - 1]` and `dp[j - 2]`, modulo `MOD`, `i` is `2`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1**
