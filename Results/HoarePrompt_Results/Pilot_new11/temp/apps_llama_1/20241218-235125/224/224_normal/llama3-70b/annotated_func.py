#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns the original value of `a`, which is the GCD of `a` and 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It accepts two integers and returns their GCD. The return value is determined by the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, not the original value of `a` as stated in the annotations. The function handles all possible integer inputs for `a` and `b`, including edge cases where one or both of the inputs are 0, correctly returning the GCD in these cases. Note that when `b` is 0, the function will return the absolute value of `a`, as the GCD of `a` and 0 is defined to be `a`. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where both `a` and `b` are 0, but based on the code, it will return 0, which is a reasonable definition for the GCD of 0 and 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer and greater than 1, and res is initially set to 0, which will store the maximum value among the results of function func_1.
def func_2(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res = max(res, func_1(res, i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous maximum and the current iteration number, from 1 to `n`, starting with `res = 0`.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous maximum and the current iteration number, from 1 to `n`, starting with `res = 0`, where `n` is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer, and returns the maximum value obtained by iteratively applying `func_1` to the previous maximum and the current iteration number, from 1 to `n`, starting with `res = 0`. If `n` is 0, the function will return 0, as no iterations of `func_1` will be performed. If `n` is 1, the function will apply `func_1` once with arguments 0 and 1, and return the result. For `n` greater than 1, the function will iteratively apply `func_1` and keep track of the maximum value obtained. Note that the function's behavior depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided in the given code. The function's return value will be the maximum value obtained after all iterations, or 0 if `n` is 0. The input variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer and f_max_n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and f_max_n represents the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n.
def func_3(n, f_max_n):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (f_max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
            dp[j] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n`, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where each `dp[j]` (for `1 <= j <= f_max_n`) is the result of a cumulative sum process starting from the initial value `dp[0] = 1`, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo `MOD`, and `i` is equal to `n`.
    return dp[f_max_n]
    #The program returns the value of dp at index f_max_n, which is the cumulative sum result at the maximum value f_max_n, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` calculates the cumulative sum at index `f_max_n` in a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1`, where each element `dp[j]` represents the cumulative sum of the previous elements, adjusted by the loop's updates and taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. It accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 2 and `10^6`, and `f_max_n`, the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers 1 to `n`. After executing the function, the program returns the value of `dp` at index `f_max_n`, effectively providing the result of the cumulative sum process. Note that the function does not perform any error checking on the input values, so it assumes that the input parameters are within the specified range. The function also does not handle cases where `f_max_n` is not a valid maximum value for the given `n`, or where the calculation of `dp` results in an overflow. The final state of the program is that it returns a single integer value, which is the result of the cumulative sum calculation, and does not modify any external state.
