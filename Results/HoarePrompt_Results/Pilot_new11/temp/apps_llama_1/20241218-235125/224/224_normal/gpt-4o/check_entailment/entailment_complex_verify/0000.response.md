Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems correct. The program is supposed to count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. However, the program simply calculates the factorial of $n-1$, which does not take into account the condition that $f(p)$ should be equal to $f_{max}(n)$.

The annotated version of the code does not provide any new insights that would change the original assessment. It confirms that the function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not consider the fact that $f_{max}(n)$ is the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$,..., $n$. It simply returns the factorial of $n-1$ for $n > 2$, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same.

Final: **False**
