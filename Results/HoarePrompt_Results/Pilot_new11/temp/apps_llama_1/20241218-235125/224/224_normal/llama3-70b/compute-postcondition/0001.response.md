The given code creates a list `dp` of size `f_max_n + 1` and initializes all elements to 0. 

The initial state has `n` as an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, `MOD` is `1000000007`. The states of the variables `n`, `f_max_n`, and `MOD` are not affected by this operation. 

However, a new variable `dp` is introduced, which is a list of size `f_max_n + 1`, where all elements are initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6`, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations p of integers 1, 2,..., n, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
