The value of `dp[j]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[j]` with `MOD`. The value of `j` is `f_max_n`, so `dp[f_max_n]` is the value that is being updated. 

`dp[f_max_n]` was initially `2 * dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 2]`, modulo `MOD`, but now it becomes `dp[f_max_n]` modulo `MOD`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `n` must be greater than 1, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1, 2,..., n` and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` is `1` and for `j` equals to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2]) % MOD`, and for all other `j` from `2` to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp[j - 1]` and `dp[j - 2]`, modulo `MOD`, `i` is `2`, `j` is `f_max_n`**
