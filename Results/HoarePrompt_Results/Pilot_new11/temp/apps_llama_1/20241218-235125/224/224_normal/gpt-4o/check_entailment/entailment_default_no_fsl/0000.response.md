Correctness: **False**

The code provided calculates the factorial of a given integer `n-1` modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is not in line with the problem description. The problem asks to count the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_{max}(n)`, where `f(p)` is the number of distinct elements among the greatest common divisors of prefixes of `p`. 

The provided code does not take into account the calculation of `f(p)` and `f_{max}(n)`. It simply calculates the factorial of `n-1`, which is not related to the problem description. 

For example, if `n = 3`, the code will calculate `2! = 2`, but the correct answer is `4` (as shown in the examples), because there are four permutations `[2,1,3]`, `[2,3,1]`, `[3,1,2]`, `[3,2,1]` such that `f(p) = 2`, which is equal to `f_{max}(3)`. 

This indicates that the code does not correctly solve the problem and does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
