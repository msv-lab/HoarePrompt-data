To solve this problem, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

The initial state is given as:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements.
- `min_cost` is positive infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- `t` is 2.
- `current_cost` and `length` are variables that are not explicitly initialized in the initial state but are used in the code snippet. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume that `current_cost` and `length` have been initialized with some values prior to the execution of the given code snippet.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
current_cost += t - 1 - length
```

Given that `t` is 2, the code snippet can be simplified as:
```python
current_cost += 2 - 1 - length
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
current_cost += 1 - length
```

Now, let's calculate the result:
- The value of `current_cost` is incremented by `1 - length`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` are not affected by the code snippet.
- The value of `t` remains 2.

Since `length` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `current_cost` based on the expression `1 - length`, without specifying a concrete value for `length` or the resulting `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2, and `current_cost` is increased by `1 - length`.**
