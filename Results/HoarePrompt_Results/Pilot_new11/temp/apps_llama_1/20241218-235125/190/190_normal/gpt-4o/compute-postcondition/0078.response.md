Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for all elements in `a`. If `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost` and `best_t` is 3. Regardless of the condition, `n`, `a`, `t`, `length`, and the calculation of `current_cost` remain unchanged, as the if statement only affects `min_cost` and `best_t` when the condition is met.***
