According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is less than 101, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be increased by 1, so `t` is 2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is less than 101, so for the loop to execute again, `t` must be less than 101.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1 depending on whether an update was made, `t` is 2**
