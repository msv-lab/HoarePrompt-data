Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly solves the problem statement by determining the optimal value of `t` that minimizes the total cost of changing stick lengths. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. **Sorting the sticks**: The code sorts the stick lengths in ascending order. This is not strictly necessary for the algorithm but makes the initial midpoint calculation easier.

2. **Initial midpoint calculation**: The code calculates an initial midpoint `mid` as the middle value of the sorted stick lengths. This provides a reasonable starting point for the search.

3. **Cost calculation**: The code calculates the cost of changing stick lengths to be almost good for a given `t`. The cost function correctly calculates the minimum cost for each stick by taking the minimum of the absolute differences between the stick length and `t` or `t - 1` (or `t + 1`, depending on the direction).

4. **Search for optimal `t`**: The code searches for the optimal `t` by iterating over possible values of `t` below and above the initial `mid`. This ensures that all possible values of `t` are considered.

5. **Update of minimum cost and `t`**: The code updates the minimum cost and corresponding `t` whenever it finds a better solution.

Given the problem constraints (stick lengths are between 1 and 100), the code will always find the optimal solution by exhaustively searching the possible range of `t` values.

The examples provided demonstrate the correctness of the code for specific inputs. Without being able to find any counterexample or scenario where the code does not behave as expected according to the problem description, it is reasonable to conclude that the code is correct.
