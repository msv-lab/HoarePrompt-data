The value of `min_t` is updated to `i`, where `i` is `mid - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial state provides that `n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and must be at least 2, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`, `t` equals `sticks[n // 2]`, `min_cost` equals `cost`, and `i` is `mid - 1`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and must be at least 2, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`, `t` equals `sticks[n // 2]`, `min_cost` equals `cost`, `min_t` equals `mid - 1`, `i` is `mid - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and must be at least 2, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`, `t` equals `sticks[n // 2]`, `min_cost` equals `cost`, `min_t` equals `mid - 1`, `i` is `mid - 1`**
