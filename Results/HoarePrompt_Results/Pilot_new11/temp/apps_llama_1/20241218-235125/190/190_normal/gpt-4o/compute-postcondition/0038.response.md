Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, the first element of `a` is `length`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 2. If `length` is less than 1, `current_cost` is 1. If `length` is 1 or more, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 3` if `length` is more than 3, otherwise `current_cost` remains unchanged.**
