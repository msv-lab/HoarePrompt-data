The code `sticks.sort()` sorts the list of stick lengths in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is the number of stick lengths. The list `sticks` is modified to be in ascending order, with the smallest stick length first and the largest stick length last.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, where 1 <= n <= 1000, and `sticks` is a sorted list of n positive integers representing stick lengths, where each stick length is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), in ascending order**
