Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and must be at least 2, `cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`, `t` equals `sticks[n // 2]`, `min_cost` equals `sum(abs(x - sticks[n // 2]) for x in sticks)`, `min_t` equals `sticks[n // 2]`, `i` is `mid - 1`. The current value of `cost` is less than the current value of `min_cost`.**
