The code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` updates the value of `current_cost` by adding the result of the expression `length - (t + 1)` to it. Given the initial state, we know that `t` is 3, and `length` is the second element in `a`. 

So, `length - (t + 1)` is equivalent to `length - 4`. 

`current_cost` is updated to be `current_cost + length - 4`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the second element in `a`, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the second element in `a`, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4**
