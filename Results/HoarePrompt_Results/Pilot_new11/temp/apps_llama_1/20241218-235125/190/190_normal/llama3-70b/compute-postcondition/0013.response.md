Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and must be at least 2. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` equals `cost`, `min_t` equals `mid - 1`, and `i` is `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged, with `min_t` initially equal to `sticks[n // 2]`.***
