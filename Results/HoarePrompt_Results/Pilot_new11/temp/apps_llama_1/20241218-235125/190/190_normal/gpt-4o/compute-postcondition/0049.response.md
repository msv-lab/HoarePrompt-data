To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the patterns observed from the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for length in a:
    if length < t - 1:
        current_cost += t - 1 - length
    elif length > t + 1:
        current_cost += length - (t + 1)
```
Given that `t` is initially 2, the conditions inside the loop check if `length` is less than 1 or greater than 3, and update `current_cost` accordingly.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:
- `n` remains unchanged as it's not updated within the loop.
- `a` must have at least as many elements as the number of times the loop has executed.
- `length` takes the value of the current element in `a` during each iteration.
- `min_cost` and `best_t` are not updated within the loop based on the provided information, so their values remain as they were initially set.
- `t` is initially 2 and does not change within the loop based on the provided code snippets.
- `current_cost` is updated based on the value of `length` relative to `t`. If `length` is less than `t - 1` (initially 1), `current_cost` increases by `t - 1 - length`. If `length` is greater than `t + 1` (initially 3), `current_cost` increases by `length - (t + 1)`.

Considering these patterns and the loop code, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `a` will be the same list of integers it was initially, but we know it must have had enough elements to execute the loop the observed number of times.
- `min_cost` and `best_t` will retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
- `t` will remain 2, as there's no code to update it within the loop.
- `current_cost` will be the sum of all adjustments made based on the differences between each `length` in `a` and the thresholds defined by `t`. Specifically, for each `length` in `a`, if `length < 1`, `current_cost` increases by `1 - length`; if `length > 3`, `current_cost` increases by `length - 3`. If `1 <= length <= 3`, `current_cost` remains unchanged for that iteration.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 2, and `current_cost` is the initial cost plus the sum of adjustments for each `length` in `a` that is less than 1 or greater than 3, based on the formulae `1 - length` for `length < 1` and `length - 3` for `length > 3`.**
