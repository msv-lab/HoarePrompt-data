The code updates the value of `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. Given the initial state, `t` is 3 and `length` is the second element in `a`. 

The value of `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + 3 - 1 - length`, which simplifies to `current_cost + 2 - length`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the second element in `a`, and `current_cost` is increased by `2 - length`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the second element in `a`, and `current_cost` is `current_cost + 2 - length`**
