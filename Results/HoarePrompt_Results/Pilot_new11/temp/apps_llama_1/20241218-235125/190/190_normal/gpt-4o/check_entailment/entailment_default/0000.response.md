Correctness: **True**

The given Python program seems to correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the minimum cost to adjust all stick lengths to be almost good for some target length `t`. The target length `t` can be any integer between 1 and 100.

The program iterates over all possible target lengths from 1 to 100, calculates the cost to adjust each stick length to be within 1 unit of the target length, and keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding target length.

The program handles all potential edge cases, including stick lengths at the boundaries (1 and 100) and target lengths at the boundaries (1 and 100). The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost and the optimal target length.

The provided examples also demonstrate that the program works correctly. For instance, when the input is `3` and the stick lengths are `10 1 4`, the program outputs `3 7`, which is correct because the stick lengths can be adjusted to `2 4 4` with a total cost of `7`, and these lengths are almost good for `t = 3`.

Similarly, when the input is `5` and the stick lengths are `1 1 2 2 3`, the program outputs `2 0`, which is correct because the stick lengths are already almost good for `t = 2`, so no adjustments are needed.

After reviewing the code and the output hints, it appears that the program correctly solves the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
