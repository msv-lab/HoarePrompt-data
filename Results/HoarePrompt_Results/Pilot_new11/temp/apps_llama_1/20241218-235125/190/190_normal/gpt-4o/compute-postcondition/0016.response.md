To calculate the result, we first need to understand the given code and initial state. The code provided is `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`. However, in the initial state, `current_cost` and `length` are not mentioned, so we will assume they are variables that exist in the context but are not specified in the initial state.

Given initial state: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1.

The code affects `current_cost` by adding the difference between `length` and `(t + 1)` to it. Since `t` is initially 1, `(t + 1)` equals 2. 

The output state includes all information from the initial state that is still valid, with the update being the change in `current_cost`. Since the exact value of `current_cost` before the operation and the value of `length` are not provided, we can only describe the change in `current_cost` relative to `length` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 2`.**
