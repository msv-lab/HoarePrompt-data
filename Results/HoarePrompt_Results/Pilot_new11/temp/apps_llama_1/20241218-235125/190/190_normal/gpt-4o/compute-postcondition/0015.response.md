The given code `current_cost += t - 1 - length` updates the value of `current_cost`. However, the initial state does not include `current_cost`, `length`. So we will include them in the output state.

The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1. The value of `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + t - 1 - length`, but the initial value of `current_cost` is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is `current_cost + 1 - 1 - length` = `current_cost - length`**
