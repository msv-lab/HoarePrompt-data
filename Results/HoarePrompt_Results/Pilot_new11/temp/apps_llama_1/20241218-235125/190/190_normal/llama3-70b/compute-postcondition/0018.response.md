Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and must be at least 2, if `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1))) for x in sticks)` is less than the original `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1))) for x in sticks)` and `min_t` is updated to `mid - 2`, otherwise, the values of `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.**
