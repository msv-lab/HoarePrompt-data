To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`.
- `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers.
- `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`.
- `i` is `mid + 2`.
- The loop statement is `for i in range(mid + 1, 101)`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 because it's a `for` loop that iterates over a range. The range starts at `mid + 1` and ends before `101`. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` needs to be `mid + 3` to continue the loop, as long as `mid + 3` is less than `101`.

Since `i` depends directly on `mid`, and the conditions for `n`, `sticks`, and `mid` do not change with each iteration of the loop (they are constants within the loop's context), we only need to update the value of `i` to understand the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer where `1 <= n <= 1000`, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `mid` is the stick length at index `n // 2` of `sticks` and `mid` is less than or equal to `100`, `i` is `mid + 3`**
