The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to it. We know that `t` is 2, so `t + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `current_cost` becomes `current_cost + length - 3`. Since `length` is more than 3, `length - 3` is positive. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, the first element of `a` is `length` and is more than or equal to 1, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found so far, `best_t` is either -1 or 1, `t` is 2, `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 3`, and the current value of `length` is more than `t + 1`, which means `length` is more than 3**
