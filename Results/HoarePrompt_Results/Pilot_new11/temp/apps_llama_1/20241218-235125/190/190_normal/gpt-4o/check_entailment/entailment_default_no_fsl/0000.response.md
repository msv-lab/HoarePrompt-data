Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the solution to the problem described. It iterates through all possible target lengths (from 1 to 100) and for each target length, it calculates the total cost of adjusting the stick lengths to be within 1 unit of the target length. The code then keeps track of the target length with the minimum total cost and prints this target length along with the corresponding minimum cost.

The code handles all potential edge cases, including stick lengths at the boundaries (1 and 100) and target lengths at the boundaries (1 and 100). It also correctly calculates the minimum cost by summing the adjustments needed for each stick to reach the target length.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the code. For instance, in the first example, the code correctly calculates that the minimum cost is 7 when the target length is 3, and in the second example, it correctly calculates that the minimum cost is 0 when the target length is 2.

The code is also efficient as it only iterates through all possible target lengths once and keeps track of the minimum cost found so far. This approach ensures that the code runs in a reasonable amount of time even for large inputs.

Overall, the code is correct and efficiently solves the problem described. It correctly handles all potential edge cases and provides the expected output for the provided examples.
