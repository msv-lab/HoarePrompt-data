Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, the first element of `a` is `length`, the initial value of `length` was greater than or equal to `t - 1` where `t` is 1, the current value of `length` is greater than `t + 1`, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0**
