Postcondition: ***the input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order, where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `i` is incremented by 1. If the original value of `i` is even, then `b` is updated to `b + a[i]` and `c`'s value depends on the updated parity of `i`. If the original value of `i` is odd, then `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`.***
