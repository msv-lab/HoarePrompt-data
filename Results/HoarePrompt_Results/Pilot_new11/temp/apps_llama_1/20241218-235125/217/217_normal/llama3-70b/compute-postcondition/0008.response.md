Given the initial state, we have `n` as an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, and `i` is an odd number.

The code `c += a[i]` increments the value of `c` by the value of `a` at index `i`. 

Since `a` is a list of integers in descending order and -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, the minimum value that can be added to `c` is -100 and the maximum value is 100.

Given that `c` is initially 0, after executing `c += a[i]`, `c` will be equal to `a[i]`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers in descending order where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100, `b` is 0, `c` is equal to `a[i]`, and `i` is an odd number.**
