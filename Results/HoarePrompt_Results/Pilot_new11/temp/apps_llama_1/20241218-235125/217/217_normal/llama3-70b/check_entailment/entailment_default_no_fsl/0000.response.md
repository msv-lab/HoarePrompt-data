Correctness: **False**

The code is trying to find the maximum possible value of B - C by summing the elements at even indices and odd indices separately after sorting the input list in descending order. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of B - C. 

The problem statement allows for any partitioning of the sequence into two sequences B and C, not just partitioning based on even and odd indices. 

For example, if the input is [1, -2, -3, 4, -5], the code will sort the list as [4, 1, -2, -3, -5] and then calculate B as 4 + (-3) and C as 1 + (-2) + (-5), resulting in B - C = 4 - 1 + (-3) - (-2) - (-5) = 7. However, the optimal solution would be to put 4 and 1 in sequence B and -2, -3, and -5 in sequence C, which would give B - C = (4 + 1) - (-2 + (-3) + (-5)) = 15.

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for every potential case, and its correctness is False.
