The input is well-formed, the first line has been read, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Now `a` is assigned the value of a list of `n` integers, which are `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` (-100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100). 

Output State: **The input is well-formed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` where -100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100**
