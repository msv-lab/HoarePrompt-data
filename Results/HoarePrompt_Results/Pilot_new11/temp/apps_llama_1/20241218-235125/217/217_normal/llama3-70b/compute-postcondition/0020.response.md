The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process two lines of input: 

1. The first line contains a single integer `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
2. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, where `-100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100`.

Since no explicit parameters are passed to the function and no specific output conditions are provided (e.g., cases based on the input integers), the functionality description will focus on the general input processing.

Functionality: **The function processes two lines of input: the first line is an integer n, and the second line contains n integers, and it returns a result based on these inputs.**
