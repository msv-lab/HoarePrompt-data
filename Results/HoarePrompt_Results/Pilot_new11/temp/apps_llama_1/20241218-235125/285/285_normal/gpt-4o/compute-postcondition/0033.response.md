Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, if `remaining_after_cars` is exactly divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns the string 'YES', otherwise, the program state remains unchanged with `n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, `a`, `b`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` retaining their initial values and relationships.**
