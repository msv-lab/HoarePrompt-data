To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we should analyze the given loop statement and the current state.

Given loop:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * `house_cost`
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `a` is 2
- `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and is greater than or equal to 0
- `b` is 0
- `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2469134` and is equal to `remaining_after_houses`
- `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0

Let's calculate some key values:
- `house_cost` is 1234567, so 2 * `house_cost` is 2469134.
- Given `a` is 2, it implies that the cost of 2 houses has been deducted from `n` to get `remaining_after_houses`. Hence, `remaining_after_houses = n - 2 * house_cost = n - 2469134`.
- `car_cost` is 123456.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to increment by 1. The loop condition is `b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`, meaning the loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `b` should be 1. 

Since `remaining_after_cars` equals `remaining_after_houses` and is used in the context of the loop (though not directly in the loop condition), and `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0, we should consider how `remaining_after_cars` changes with `b`.

However, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we only need to consider the increment of `b` and its impact on `remaining_after_cars`, given that `remaining_after_cars` is initially equal to `remaining_after_houses` and `b` is incremented by 1.

When `b` increments by 1, `remaining_after_cars` would decrease by `car_cost` because we are essentially buying one more car. Therefore, the new `remaining_after_cars` should be `remaining_after_cars - car_cost`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - car_cost` and `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
