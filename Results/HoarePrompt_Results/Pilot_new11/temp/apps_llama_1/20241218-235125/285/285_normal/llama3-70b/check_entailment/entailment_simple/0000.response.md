Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description because it checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers to determine whether Kolya's initial game-coin score `n` can be spent entirely on these items.

Here's why the program works:

1. The outer loop iterates over possible numbers of houses (`a`) that Kolya can buy, up to the maximum number of houses he can afford with his initial score `n`.

2. The inner loop iterates over possible numbers of cars (`b`) that Kolya can buy, after subtracting the cost of buying `a` houses from his initial score `n`.

3. For each combination of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`), the program calculates the maximum number of computers (`c`) that Kolya can buy with the remaining game-coins.

4. If the total cost of buying `a` houses, `b` cars, and `c` computers equals Kolya's initial score `n`, the program prints 'YES' and exits.

5. If the program finishes checking all possible combinations without finding one that equals Kolya's initial score `n`, it prints 'NO'.

This program correctly checks whether there exists a triple of non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `a × 1,234,567 + b × 123,456 + c × 1,234 = n`, which is the condition stated in the problem description.
