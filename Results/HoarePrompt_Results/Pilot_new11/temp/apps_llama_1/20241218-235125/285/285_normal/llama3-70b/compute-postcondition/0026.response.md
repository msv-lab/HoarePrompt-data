To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1234567
- `a` is 1
- `b` is 0
- `c` is the integer result of `(n - 1234567) // 1234`
- If `n` equals `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`, then the string 'YES' has been printed and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the given conditions and `n` does not equal `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`.

Loop statement:
```python
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over a range that depends on `n`, `a`, and the constant `123456`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `b` should be incremented to 1. 

Now, we need to understand how `n` and `c` are affected by this change in `b`. 

Given that `c` is the integer result of `(n - 1234567) // 1234` and `n` does not equal `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`, we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than or equal to 1234567 and that the relationship between `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` still holds.

Since `b` is now 1 and assuming the loop body doesn't change `n` or `a` (as the loop body is omitted), we keep `a` as 1. 

For `c`, it depends on `n`, and since `n` is adjusted based on the condition that it does not equal `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`, and now `b` is 1, the relationship between `n` and `c` needs to account for the increment in `b`.

However, the condition that `n` does not equal `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` must still hold, and since `b` has increased by 1, `n`'s relationship with `c` will adjust accordingly to maintain this inequality.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` is still greater than or equal to 1234567 but now considering `b` is 1.
- `a` remains 1.
- `b` is now 1.
- `c` will adjust based on the new value of `n` and the condition that `n` does not equal `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`, but its exact value depends on how `n` is adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `c` is the integer result of `(n - 1234567) // 1234` considering the updated `n` and the condition that `n` does not equal `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234`**
