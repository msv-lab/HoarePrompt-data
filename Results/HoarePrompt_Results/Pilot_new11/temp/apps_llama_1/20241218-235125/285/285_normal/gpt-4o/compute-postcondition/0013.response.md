Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `b` is 1. If `remaining_after_cars` (which is `n - 123456`) is a multiple of `computer_cost`, the program returns the string 'YES'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
