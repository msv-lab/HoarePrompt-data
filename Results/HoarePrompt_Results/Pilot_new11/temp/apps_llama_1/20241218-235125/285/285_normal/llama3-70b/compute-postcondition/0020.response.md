To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range has at least one element. The range is defined by the expression `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1`. For the loop to execute, this expression must be greater than 0.

Given that `a` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(n - 1234567) // 123456 + 1`. To ensure that the loop executes, `(n - 1234567) // 123456` must be greater than or equal to 0, but since we're adding 1, the expression will always be at least 1 as long as `(n - 1234567) // 123456` is not negative. Thus, for the loop to have at least one iteration, `n` should be such that `(n - 1234567) // 123456` is not negative, implying `n` should be greater than or equal to 1234567 to guarantee a non-negative result before adding 1.

However, considering the nature of the range function and the requirement for the loop to execute, the critical factor is that `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` must be greater than 0, which means `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `a` is 1, this simplifies to `n` being greater than or equal to 1234567 for the expression before the division to be non-negative, ensuring the loop has at least one iteration.

At the start of the loop, `b` will be 0 (since range starts from 0 by default), and for the loop to execute, `n` must be in a state that makes the range expression valid (i.e., `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 > 0`).

State: **`n` is the original input integer which must be greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is 0**
