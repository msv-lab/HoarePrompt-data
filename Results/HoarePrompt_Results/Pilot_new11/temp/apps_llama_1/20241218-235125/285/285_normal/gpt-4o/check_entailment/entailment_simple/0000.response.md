Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

*   The program takes an integer `n` as input, representing Kolya's initial game-coin score.
*   It defines the costs of a house, car, and computer as specified in the problem description.
*   It uses two nested loops to iterate over the possible number of houses (`a`) and cars (`b`) that can be bought with `n` game-coins.
*   For each combination of `a` and `b`, it calculates the remaining game-coins after buying houses and cars, and checks if this amount is divisible by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`).
*   If it finds a combination where the remaining game-coins are divisible by `computer_cost`, it returns 'YES', indicating that Kolya can spend all his initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.
*   If it exhausts all possible combinations without finding a valid solution, it returns 'NO', indicating that there is no way for Kolya to spend all his initial game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers.

This program correctly implements the problem description because it:

*   Handles all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that can be bought with `n` game-coins.
*   Correctly checks if the remaining game-coins after buying houses and cars can be spent on computers.
*   Returns 'YES' if a valid combination is found, and 'NO' otherwise, as required by the problem description.

The program assumes that the input will be a valid positive integer, as specified in the problem description, and it does not handle cases where the input may be invalid (e.g., negative, zero, or non-integer). However, since the problem states that we can assume the input will be valid, this is not a concern.
