Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567 - 123456`. If `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` equals 0, the program returns the string 'YES'. Otherwise, no value is returned.**
