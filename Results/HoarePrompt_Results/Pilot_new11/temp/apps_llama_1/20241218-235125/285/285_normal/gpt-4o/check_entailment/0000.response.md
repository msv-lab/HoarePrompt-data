Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers that do not exceed the initial game-coin score `n`. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It correctly calculates the cost of buying `a` houses, `b` cars, and checks if the remaining amount can be spent on computers.
2. The program iterates over all possible values of `a` (number of houses) and `b` (number of cars) that do not exceed the initial game-coin score `n`.
3. For each pair of `a` and `b`, it checks if the remaining amount `remaining_after_cars` can be divided evenly by the cost of a computer (`computer_cost`).
4. If it finds a combination where the remaining amount can be spent on computers, it immediately returns 'YES'.
5. If it checks all possible combinations and does not find a valid solution, it returns 'NO'.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including edge cases where `n` is less than the cost of a house, a car, or a computer. It also correctly handles cases where `n` is exactly equal to the cost of a house, a car, or a computer.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
