The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program. When `exit()` is called, the program stops execution and no further code is run. The values of the variables do not change, but the program ends.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 123456) // 1234`, `n // 1234567 + 1` is at least 1, `n // 123456 + 1` is at least 2, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has terminated**
