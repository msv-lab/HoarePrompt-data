Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * `house_cost`, where `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, the current value of `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses` and is `n - 2469134`, and the current value of `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost`, meaning `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost` with no remainder.**
