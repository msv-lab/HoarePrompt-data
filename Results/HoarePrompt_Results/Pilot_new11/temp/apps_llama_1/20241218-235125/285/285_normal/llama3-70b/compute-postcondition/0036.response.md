To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
    c = (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234
    if a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n:
        print('YES')
        exit()
```
The loop iterates over the range of `b` values, and for each `b`, it calculates the value of `c`. If the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` is met, the loop exits and prints 'YES'.

From the given output states, we can observe that:

* `n` is greater than or equal to 1234567
* `a` remains constant at 1
* `b` takes on values from 0 to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`
* `c` is calculated based on the current values of `n`, `a`, and `b`

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude that:

* If the loop executed at least once, `n` is greater than or equal to 1234567
* `a` remains constant at 1
* `b` will have taken on all values from 0 to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`
* If the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` was met during any iteration, the loop exited and printed 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop completed all iterations without finding a match.

However, the loop's execution and the final values of the variables also depend on whether the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` was ever met. If it was, the program would have exited, and the final state would reflect the values at the point of exit. If not, the loop would have completed all its iterations.

Thus, considering all possibilities, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `a` is 1, and if `n` is less than 1234567, the loop does not execute; if `n` is greater than or equal to 1234567 and the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` is met for any `b` in the given range, the program has printed 'YES' and exited, otherwise, `b` has taken on all values from 0 to `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456` without finding a match.**
