To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and how it affects the return statement. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * `house_cost`, and `house_cost` is 1234567, we can deduce that `n` is greater than or equal to 2469134. 

`car_cost` is 123456, and `computer_cost` is 1234. 

The value of `a` is given as 2, but it's not directly relevant to the return statement in this context.

`remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134`, which is greater than or equal to 0. This implies that after buying two houses (2 * `house_cost`), there is still some amount left, which is `remaining_after_houses`.

`b` is 0, which doesn't affect the return statement directly in this scenario.

`remaining_after_cars` equals `remaining_after_houses`, which is `n - 2469134`. This value is also a multiple of `computer_cost` (1234), meaning it is divisible by 1234 without any remainder.

The code simply returns the string 'YES'. This return statement is not conditional based on the provided variables and their states; it returns 'YES' regardless of the specific values of `n`, `remaining_after_houses`, `remaining_after_cars`, etc., as long as the initial conditions are met.

Therefore, the output state, considering the return statement and the context provided, is that the program returns the string 'YES', indicating that the conditions for `n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, `remaining_after_houses`, and `remaining_after_cars` have been met.

Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**
