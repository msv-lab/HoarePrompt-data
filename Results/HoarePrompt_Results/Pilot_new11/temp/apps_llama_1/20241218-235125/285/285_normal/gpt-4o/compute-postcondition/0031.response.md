The value of `remaining_after_cars` is updated to be `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. We know that `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and `b` is 2 and `car_cost` is 123456. 

The new value of `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1234567 - 2 * 123456`. This can be simplified to `n - 1234567 - 246912`, which is `n - 1479479`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1479479`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 1234567` and is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 1479479`**
