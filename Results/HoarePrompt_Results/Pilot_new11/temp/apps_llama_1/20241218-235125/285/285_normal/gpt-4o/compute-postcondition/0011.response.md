To find the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567)
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `a` is 0
- `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and must be greater than 0
- `b` is 1
- `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n` (and thus also equal to `remaining_after_houses`) and must be greater than `car_cost`
- `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0

The code is:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```

Given that `b` is 1 and `car_cost` is 123456, the equation becomes:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 1 * 123456
```
Or more simply:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 123456
```

Since `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, we can substitute it:
```python
remaining_after_cars = n - 123456
```

Now, let's consider the constraints:
- `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567), so `n - 123456` will still be greater than 0 because `house_cost - car_cost` is positive (1234567 - 123456 = 1111111, which is greater than 0).
- The condition that `remaining_after_cars` must be greater than `car_cost` (123456) needs to be reevaluated after the subtraction. Given that `n` is at least 1234567, subtracting 123456 ensures that `remaining_after_cars` is at least 1111111, which is indeed greater than `car_cost`.
- The condition that `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0 may or may not hold after the operation, depending on the exact value of `n`. However, since we're looking at the general case and the operation doesn't directly affect the modulo condition with `computer_cost`, we note that the new value of `remaining_after_cars` could potentially satisfy or not satisfy this condition based on `n`'s specific value.

The states of `n`, `house_cost`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`, `a`, and `b` are not changed by the code. `remaining_after_houses` was initially equal to `n`, and its value does not change in the given code snippet, so it remains equal to `n`. Only `remaining_after_cars` is updated.

Therefore, the output state, considering the changes and the initial conditions that still apply, is:
- `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567)
- `house_cost` is 1234567
- `car_cost` is 123456
- `computer_cost` is 1234
- `a` is 0
- `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and must be greater than 0
- `b` is 1
- `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n - 123456`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and must be greater than 0, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n - 123456`**
