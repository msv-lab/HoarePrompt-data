To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration. The for loop statement is:

```
for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
```

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is 0
- `b` is 0
- `c` is `n // 1234`
- `n // 1234567 + 1` is at least 1
- `n // 123456 + 1` is at least 1

The loop will execute again if `b` is less than `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0, and for the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be increased by 1. So, the new value of `b` should be 1.

The condition `(n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1` must still be greater than `b` for the loop to execute again. Since `a` is 0, this simplifies to `n // 123456 + 1` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `c` is `n // 1234`, `n // 1234567 + 1` is at least 1, and `n // 123456 + 1` is at least 2**
