Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to `house_cost` (1234567), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 0, the current value of `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n` and is greater than 0, `b` is 0, the current value of `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n` (and thus also equal to `remaining_after_houses`) and is greater than 0. The current value of `remaining_after_cars` is a multiple of `computer_cost` (i.e., `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` equals 0)**
