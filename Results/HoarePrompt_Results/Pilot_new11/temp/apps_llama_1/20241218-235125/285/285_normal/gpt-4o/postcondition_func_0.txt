The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and returns either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether it is possible to buy a combination of houses, cars, and computers with `n` units of money, with specific costs for each item (house_cost = 1234567, car_cost = 123456, and computer_cost = 1234), where the combination must allow the total cost of houses and cars to leave a remainder that is exactly divisible by the cost of a computer. The function will return 'YES' as soon as it finds such a combination and 'NO' if it exhausts all possible combinations without finding a suitable one. The return value indicates whether such a purchase combination exists, without specifying the exact combination of houses, cars, and computers that can be bought. The function handles all positive integer inputs within the specified range but does not account for inputs outside this range or non-integer inputs.
