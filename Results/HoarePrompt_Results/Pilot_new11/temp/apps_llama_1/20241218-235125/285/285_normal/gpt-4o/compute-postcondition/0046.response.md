To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * 1234567.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- `a` is 2.
- `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `b` is 1.
- `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2590580`.

The loop statement is `for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop iterates over the range specified by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. 

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `b` will be `b + 1`, which means `b` will be 2.
- Since the loop body is omitted and the condition for the loop to continue depends on `b` being within the specified range, the other states remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided.
- However, since `remaining_after_cars` depends on `n` and `b` (as it is calculated as `n - 2590580` but in the context of the loop, it might implicitly depend on `b` through the loop's progression), and assuming `remaining_after_cars` is actually meant to reflect the effect of buying `b` cars (each costing `car_cost`), we should note that `remaining_after_cars` might be calculated differently within the loop. But based strictly on the information given, we do not modify `remaining_after_cars` directly here.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration, based on the explicit information provided and without making assumptions about the loop body, is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2 * 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `a` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - 2469134` and is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - 2590580`**
