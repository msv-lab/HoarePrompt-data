To find the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 1, and ((n - x * a) % b) is not equal to 0, which simplifies to (n - a) % b is not equal to 0.

The code is: `y = (n - x * a) // b`

Given that `x` is 1, the expression `(n - x * a)` simplifies to `(n - a)`. 

So, `y = (n - a) // b`

Since `(n - a) % b` is not equal to 0, `(n - a)` is not exactly divisible by `b`, meaning the remainder when `(n - a)` is divided by `b` is not 0.

The value of `y` will be the integer part of the division of `(n - a)` by `b`, which is the quotient without the remainder.

The states of `n`, `b`, `a`, and `x` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 1, (n - a) % b is not equal to 0, and `y` is the integer part of `(n - a)` divided by `b`.**
