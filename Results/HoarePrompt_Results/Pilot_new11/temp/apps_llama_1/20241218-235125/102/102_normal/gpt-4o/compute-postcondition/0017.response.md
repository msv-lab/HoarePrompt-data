To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given Initial State:
- `n` is an integer
- `b` is an integer
- `a` is a non-zero integer
- `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`
- `x` is 2
- `x` must be less than or equal to `n // a`

The code snippet is:
```python
y = (n - x * a) // b
```

Now, we substitute the given value of `x` into the equation:
```python
y = (n - 2 * a) // b
```

The states of the variables `n`, `b`, `a`, and `x` are not changed by this operation. The only new information is the value of `y`, which is now `(n - 2 * a) // b`.

Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions that are still valid, plus the new value of `y`:
- `n` is an integer
- `b` is an integer
- `a` is a non-zero integer
- `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`
- `x` is 2
- `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`
- `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 2, `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`, and `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`**
