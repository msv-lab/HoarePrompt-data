The given code simply prints the current values of `x` and `y`. It does not modify any variables. 

Given that `x` is 0 and `y` is `n // b`, the code will print `0` and `n // b`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 'YES' has already been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-zero input integer, `b` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, `x` multiplied by `a` plus `y` multiplied by `b` equals `n`, 'YES' has been printed, and `0` and `n // b` have been printed**
