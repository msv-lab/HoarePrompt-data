The new value of `b` is assigned by taking an input and converting it to an integer using `int(input())`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**
