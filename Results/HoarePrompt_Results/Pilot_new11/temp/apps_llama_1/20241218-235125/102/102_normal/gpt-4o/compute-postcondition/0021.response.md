Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `a` is a non-zero integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `-a`, `x` is 2, and `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`. If `(n - x * a)` is divisible by `b`, the program returns None. Otherwise, no specific action is taken, maintaining the existing state of the variables.***
