Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and meets its requirements.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program takes input for `n`, `a`, and `b` and checks for all possible non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b == n`.
2. The loop iterates over all possible values of `x` from 0 to `n // a`. For each `x`, it calculates the corresponding value of `y` using the equation `y = (n - x * a) // b`.
3. If the program finds a pair of `x` and `y` that satisfies the equation `x * a + y * b == n`, it immediately prints "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`, and exits the program using the `exit()` function.
4. If the program exhausts all possible values of `x` without finding a pair that satisfies the equation, it prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to buy bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars to spend exactly `n` burles.

The program handles all possible cases as required by the problem description:

* If there is at least one solution to the equation `x * a + y * b == n`, the program finds one such solution and prints it.
* If there are no solutions to the equation, the program correctly prints "NO".

There are no restrictions on the inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` that are not handled by the program, as long as they are within the specified ranges. The program assumes valid input and handles it correctly.

In conclusion, the program follows the problem description, meets its requirements, and handles all possible cases correctly, making it a correct program.
