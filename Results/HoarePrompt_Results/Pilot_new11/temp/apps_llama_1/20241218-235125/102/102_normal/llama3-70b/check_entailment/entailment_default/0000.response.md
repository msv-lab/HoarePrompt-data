Correctness: **True**.

The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It checks all possible integer values of `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and corresponding `y` (number of Bars bars) to see if the equation `n = x * a + y * b` holds true, where `n` is the total amount of money, `a` is the cost of one Ber-Cola bottle, and `b` is the cost of one Bars bar.

The code iterates over all possible values of `x` from 0 to `n // a` (integer division, which gives the maximum number of Ber-Cola bottles that can be bought with `n` burles), calculates the corresponding `y` value, and checks if the equation `n = x * a + y * b` is satisfied. If a solution is found, the code prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and exits the function. If no solution is found after checking all possibilities, the code prints 'NO'.

The output hints agree with the code, and the provided examples demonstrate that the code works correctly for different input cases. Since the input constraints specify that `a` and `b` are greater than or equal to 1, the code implicitly handles the cases where `a` or `b` might be zero.

The code is also efficient, with a time complexity of O(n/a), where n is the total amount of money and a is the cost of one Ber-Cola bottle. This is acceptable given the constraints on the input values.

Overall, the code correctly solves the problem and handles all potential cases, so its correctness is true.
