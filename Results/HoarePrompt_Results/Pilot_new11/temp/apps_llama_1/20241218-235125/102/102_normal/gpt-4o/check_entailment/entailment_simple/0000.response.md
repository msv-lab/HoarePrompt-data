Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input values `n`, `a`, and `b` correctly.
2. It then iterates over all possible non-negative integer values of `x` (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) from 0 to `n // a` (inclusive). This is because `x` cannot be greater than `n // a`, as the cost of `x` bottles of Ber-Cola would exceed `n`.
3. For each value of `x`, it checks if the remaining amount `n - x * a` is a multiple of `b` (the cost of one Bars bar). If it is, it calculates the corresponding value of `y` (the number of Bars bars) as `(n - x * a) // b`.
4. If a solution is found (i.e., `n - x * a` is a multiple of `b`), the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`. It then returns immediately.
5. If the loop completes without finding a solution, the program prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles by buying bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars.

The program handles all possible cases and does not assume any additional information beyond what is specified in the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.

In particular, the program handles the following cases correctly:

* When a solution exists: The program finds a valid solution and prints "YES" followed by the correct values of `x` and `y`.
* When no solution exists: The program prints "NO" correctly.
* When `n` is a multiple of `a` or `b`: The program handles these cases correctly and finds a solution if one exists.
* When `x` or `y` is 0: The program handles these cases correctly and prints the correct values of `x` and `y`.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all possible cases correctly.
