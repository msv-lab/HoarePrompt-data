Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$, where an operation can delete a contiguous substring of equal letters. 

The program works by iterating through the string $s$ and incrementing the answer whenever it encounters a letter that is different from the previous one. This approach is correct because each contiguous substring of equal letters can be deleted in a single operation. 

For example, if the string is "abaca", the program will correctly output 3, because we can delete the substrings "a", "b", and "aca" in three operations.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the string $s$, which is efficient for the given problem constraints. 

I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs for which the program would not work correctly. The program handles strings of any length up to 500 characters and correctly calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string. 

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and will work as expected for all valid inputs.
