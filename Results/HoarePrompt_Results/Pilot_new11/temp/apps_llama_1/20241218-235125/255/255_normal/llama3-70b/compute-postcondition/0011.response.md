The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` can be 1, 2, or 3. After incrementing by 1, `ans` can be 2, 3, or 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is 2, 3, or 4.
Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is 2, 3, or 4**
