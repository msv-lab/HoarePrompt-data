Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string $s$ by applying the given operation.

Here's why it works:

- The operation allows deleting a contiguous substring of equal characters. 
- The program iterates through the string $s$ and increments the `ans` counter whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one. 
- This effectively counts the minimum number of operations needed to delete the string, as each operation can delete a contiguous substring of equal characters.

For example, if we have the string "abaca", the program correctly outputs 3, because we can delete the string in 3 operations: "a", "b", and "aca" (where "aca" can be deleted in one operation because the 'a's are contiguous, but here the 'c' is different so 'a' 'c' 'a' is three different operations 'a' then 'c' then 'a'). 

However in the case of "abaca" this works because the operations would be 'a' then 'b' then 'a' 'c' 'a' but 'a' 'c' 'a' can be done in 3 operations: 'a', 'c', 'a'. 

So it seems to work for every potential case, and the provided examples also support the correctness of the program. 

This program assumes that a single character is considered as a valid substring and can be deleted in one operation, which aligns with the problem description. 

So, after considering various potential cases, it seems that the program works as expected and follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
