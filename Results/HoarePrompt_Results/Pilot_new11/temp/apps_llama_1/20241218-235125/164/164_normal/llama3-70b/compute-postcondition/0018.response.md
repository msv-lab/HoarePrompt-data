The code `t = i` assigns the value of `i` to `t`. Given that `i` is 2, `t` will be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The character at index 2 of string `s` still determines the values of `g` and `t` as before, but now `t` is 2. If the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 1. If the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'T', then the condition for `t` is overwritten by `t = i`, so `t` is 2. For any other character at index 2 of string `s`, `t` is 2 and `g` depends on the character at index 2 of string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 2, `t` is 2, if the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 1, if the character at index 2 of string `s` is 'T', then `g` depends on the character at index 2 of string `s`, for any other character at index 2 of string `s`, `g` depends on the character at index 2 of string `s`**
