The code `t = i` assigns the value of `i` to `t`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `t` becomes 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an input integer greater than 1, `k` is still an input integer, `s` is still an input string, and `i` is still 1. The value of `g` still depends on the character at index 1 of string `s`, but since no operation is performed on `g` or `s`, their relationship remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, and `g` depends on the character at index 1 of string `s`**
