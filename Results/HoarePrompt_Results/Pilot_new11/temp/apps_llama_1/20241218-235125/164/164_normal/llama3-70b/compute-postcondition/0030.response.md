Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is `n-1`, `g` is the index of the last 'G' in the first `n` characters of `s` or -1 if 'G' is not found, `t` is the index of the last 'T' in the first `n` characters of `s` or -1 if 'T' is not found. If either `g` or `t` is -1, the string 'NO' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and all characters at indices `(g + i * k) % n` for `i` ranging from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` (inclusive) in the string `s` are not '#', then 'YES' has been printed to the console. In all other cases, where either `abs(t - g)` is not a multiple of `k` or there exists at least one `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` (inclusive) such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is equal to '#', 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
