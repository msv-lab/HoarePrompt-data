It seems like the function definition provided is incomplete as it doesn't include any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints given, I will assume the function is defined as follows:
```python
def func(n, k):
```
Given the parameter constraints: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n - 1.

Since the specific output details are not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the given parameter constraints.

The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive). 

Without specific output details, the functionality can only be described in terms of input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k` within the specified ranges.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer between 2 and 100, and k is an integer between 1 and n-1.**
