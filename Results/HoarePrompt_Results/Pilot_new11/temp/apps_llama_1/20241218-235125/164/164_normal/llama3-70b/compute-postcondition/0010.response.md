Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', then `g` is 0 and `t` is -1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T', then `t` is 0 and `g` is -1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is neither 'G' nor 'T', then both `g` and `t` are -1.**
