Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the line where it checks if the grasshopper can make the jumps without encountering any obstacles. The condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` only checks the cells that the grasshopper will land on, but it does not consider the intermediate cells.

However, according to the problem description, it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not, as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario.

For example, if we have the input:
```
6 2
..G..T
```
The program will print "NO" because it checks the cells that the grasshopper will land on and sees that they are not obstacles. However, the correct implementation should allow the grasshopper to jump over the intermediate cells.

A correct implementation would involve performing a breadth-first search (BFS) from the grasshopper's initial position, exploring all possible jumps, and checking if the target position can be reached. 

Here is an example of how the correct implementation could look:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([g])
        visited.add(g)
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            if current == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            for jump in [-k, k]:
                next_pos = current + jump
                if 0 <= next_pos < n and next_pos not in visited and s[next_pos]!= '#':
                    queue.append(next_pos)
                    visited.add(next_pos)
        print('NO')
```
