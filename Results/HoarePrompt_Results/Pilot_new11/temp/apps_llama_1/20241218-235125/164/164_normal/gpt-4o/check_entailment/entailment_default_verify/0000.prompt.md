You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if G_pos > T_pos:
        (G_pos, T_pos) = (T_pos, G_pos)
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    if reachable:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It only checks if there is a path from the grasshopper to the insect by jumping in one direction (to the right) with a step size of `k`. However, the problem description states that the grasshopper can jump in both directions (to the left and to the right) with a step size of `k`.

For example, if the input is:

```
6 2
G....T
```

The program will print "NO" because it only checks in one direction (to the right). However, the grasshopper can actually jump to the left with a step size of 2 and then jump to the right with a step size of 2 to reach the insect.

A correct implementation would require using a graph traversal algorithm (such as BFS or DFS) to explore all possible jumping paths from the grasshopper to the insect, taking into account jumps in both directions. 

Here's an example of how this could be implemented in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited.add(G_pos)

    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        for next_pos in [pos + k, pos - k]:
            if 0 <= next_pos < n and next_pos not in visited and line[next_pos] in ['.', 'T']:
                queue.append(next_pos)
                visited.add(next_pos)

    print('NO')

func()
```

This implementation uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible jumping paths from the grasshopper to the insect. It keeps track of the positions that have already been visited to avoid revisiting them and to ensure that the algorithm terminates. If the insect's position is reached, the function prints "YES" and returns. If all possible positions have been visited and the insect's position has not been reached, the function prints "NO".

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function determines whether it's possible to move from a position marked 'G' to a position marked 'T' in a given string `line` with a step size of `k`, without encountering an obstacle marked '#'. The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k` through user input, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`. However, the value of `n` is not used in the function. The function prints 'YES' if the path exists and 'NO' otherwise, analyzing the string `line` character by character from the position of 'G' to the position of 'T' with the specified step size. The function considers all possible paths with the given step size, handles edge cases where 'G' and 'T' are in different positions, and correctly identifies the path as reachable only if it can reach 'T' without encountering any obstacles. The final state of the program after execution will be that it has printed 'YES' if a path from 'G' to 'T' with step size `k` without obstacles exists, and 'NO' otherwise, based on the input string `line` and the step size `k`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
