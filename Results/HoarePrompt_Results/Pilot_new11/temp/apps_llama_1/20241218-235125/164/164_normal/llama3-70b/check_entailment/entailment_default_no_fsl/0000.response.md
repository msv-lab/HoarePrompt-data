Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. One case that it does not handle correctly is when the grasshopper needs to jump over multiple empty cells to reach the target insect. 

For example, consider the input:
```
7 3
T..#..G
```
The code will incorrectly print 'YES' because it checks if the absolute difference between the positions of the grasshopper and the target insect is a multiple of the hop size `k`, and if the cells at positions that are multiples of `k` from the grasshopper's position are not obstacles. However, it does not check if all the cells between these positions are empty.

To fix this, the code needs to check if all the cells between the grasshopper's position and the target insect's position, at intervals of `k`, are either empty or obstacles that the grasshopper can jump over. 

Another issue with the code is that it uses the modulo operator `%` to wrap around the string, but this is not necessary because the grasshopper can only jump to positions that are at most `n-k` steps away from its current position, where `n` is the length of the string. 

In addition, the code does not handle the case when the grasshopper and the target insect are at the same position. 

To correct these issues, the code needs to be modified to check all the possible jumps that the grasshopper can make, taking into account the obstacles and the wrap-around nature of the environment. This can be achieved using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which explores all the possible states of the system level by level, starting from the initial state. 

Here is an example of how the code can be modified to use BFS:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i

    queue = deque([g])
    visited = set([g])

    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == t:
            print('YES')
            return
        for next_pos in [pos + k, pos - k]:
            if 0 <= next_pos < n and s[next_pos]!= '#' and next_pos not in visited:
                queue.append(next_pos)
                visited.add(next_pos)
    print('NO')

func()
```
This modified code uses a BFS algorithm to explore all the possible positions that the grasshopper can reach, starting from its initial position. It keeps track of the positions that have already been visited to avoid revisiting them. If the grasshopper can reach the target insect's position, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
