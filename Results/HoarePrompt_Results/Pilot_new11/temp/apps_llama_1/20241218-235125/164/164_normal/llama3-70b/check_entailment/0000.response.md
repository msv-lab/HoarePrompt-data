Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper needs to jump over obstacles to reach the target. The condition `all((s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)))` checks if all cells that the grasshopper will land on are empty, but it does not check if the grasshopper can jump over obstacles.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2
#G..T
```
In this case, the grasshopper can jump from the second cell to the fourth cell, landing on the target cell, but the program will return 'NO' because the third cell is an obstacle.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to use a more advanced algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), to explore all possible paths that the grasshopper can take. 

A correct solution would involve creating a graph where each cell is a node, and the grasshopper can jump from one node to another if the distance between them is a multiple of k and there are no obstacles between them. Then, the program can use a search algorithm to find a path from the grasshopper's starting cell to the target cell. 

Here is a revised version of the function using BFS:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (g, t) = (-1, -1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i
    if g == -1 or t == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([g])
        while queue:
            pos = queue.popleft()
            if pos == t:
                print('YES')
                return
            visited.add(pos)
            for d in [-k, k]:
                new_pos = pos + d
                if 0 <= new_pos < n and new_pos not in visited:
                    queue.append(new_pos)
        print('NO')
```
This revised function correctly handles cases where the grasshopper needs to jump over obstacles to reach the target.
