Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description in all cases. The issue is with the way the program checks for reachable positions. It only checks positions from 'G' to 'T' in increments of 'k' in one direction (from left to right), but the problem description states that the grasshopper can jump to any empty cell that is exactly 'k' cells away from the current position, either to the left or to the right.

For example, consider a string where 'G' and 'T' are not in the same order as they appear in the input string, the program will not be able to correctly determine the reachability because it does not consider jumps in the other direction. 

Another case is where there are empty cells between 'G' and 'T' that are not at a distance of 'k' from 'G' but could be reached by jumping over obstacles from a different position that is 'k' cells away from 'G'. The program does not consider these cases.

The program should be using a more comprehensive approach, such as using a queue or a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible reachable positions from 'G', considering jumps in both directions. This would ensure that it correctly determines whether 'T' is reachable from 'G' according to the problem description. 

Here's a correct implementation in Python:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')

    visited = set()
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited.add(G_pos)

    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return

        for new_pos in [pos - k, pos + k]:
            if (0 <= new_pos < n) and (line[new_pos]!= '#') and (new_pos not in visited):
                queue.append(new_pos)
                visited.add(new_pos)

    print('NO')
```
