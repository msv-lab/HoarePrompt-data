You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct. It accurately calculates the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to Ivan to satisfy the problem conditions. 

The program first calculates the minimum number of coins `min_x` that each friend must gift such that the total number of new coins is at least `L`. This is done using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is the ceiling of `L / M`.

Then, it checks if it is possible for each friend to gift `min_x` different coins. If `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, it means that each friend can gift `min_x` different coins without exceeding the total number of coins `N` or the number of coins that Ivan does not have (`N - K`). In this case, the program prints `min_x`.

If `M * min_x` is greater than `N - K`, it means that it is not possible for each friend to gift `min_x` different coins without exceeding the total number of coins or the number of coins that Ivan does not have. In this case, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to satisfy the problem conditions.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including when `N` is equal to `K`, when `M` is equal to `1`, and when `L` is equal to `0`. It also correctly handles the cases when the input values are at their minimum or maximum allowed values.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and handles all possible edge cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function determines the minimum number of rounds Ivan needs to receive a specified number of new coins from his friends. It takes four parameters: the total number of different collectible coins (N), the number of friends (M), the number of coins Ivan already has (K), and the minimum number of new coins Ivan must receive (L). The function returns the minimum number of rounds (min_x) if Ivan can receive at least L new coins without exceeding the total number of available coins (N - K), considering that each friend can give one coin per round. If the minimum number of rounds required to receive L new coins would exceed the available coins, the function returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to fulfill Ivan's requirement. The function does not modify the input parameters and only provides a calculated output based on the given conditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
