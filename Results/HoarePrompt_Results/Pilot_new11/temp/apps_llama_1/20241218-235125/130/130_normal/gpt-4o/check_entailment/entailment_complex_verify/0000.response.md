The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. 

The annotated version of the code further supports this assessment by clearly describing the state of the program at different points and explaining the logic behind the code. 

The code calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to Ivan to ensure that he receives at least `L` new coins. This is done by calculating `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M`, which is the minimum number of coins each friend must gift to guarantee that Ivan receives at least `L` new coins.

The code then checks if it is possible for each friend to gift `min_x` coins without exceeding the total number of available coins (`N - K`). If this condition is met, the code prints `min_x` as the minimum number of coins each friend must gift. Otherwise, it prints `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to fulfill Ivan's requirement.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly handles all potential cases and examples, and it correctly implements the logic described in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**.
