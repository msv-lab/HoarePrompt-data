The values of `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are assigned the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which means they are assigned the integer values from the input string split into separate integers. The previous values of `N`, `M`, `K`, `L` are overwritten. The value of `input` is consumed and is no longer available.

The constraints from the initial state that `1 <= K <= N <= 10^18`, `1 <= M, L <= 10^18` are still valid, but now we have specific integer values for `N`, `M`, `K`, `L`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, the total number of different collectible coins from the input, `M` is an integer, the number of friends from the input, `K` is an integer, the number of coins Ivan already has from the input, `L` is an integer, the minimum number of new coins Ivan must receive from the input, and `input` is a consumed input string**
