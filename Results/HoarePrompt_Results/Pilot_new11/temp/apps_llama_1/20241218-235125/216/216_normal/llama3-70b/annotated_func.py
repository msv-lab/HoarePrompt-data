#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit parameters, but it implicitly reads two inputs: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of a string, and a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for i, c in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two implicit parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s`, reads them from the user input, and then calculates the number of lowercase letters in the string `s`. It returns this count as output, printing it to the console, regardless of the value of `n`. The input integer `n` is not used in the function's logic. The function assumes that the user will provide a valid integer for `n` and a string for `s`, without performing any error checking. After the function concludes, the program's state is such that the user has been prompted to input an integer and a string, and the number of lowercase letters in the input string has been printed to the console. The function does not modify the input string `s` or store it in any way after processing, and its execution does not depend on the length `n` of the string, despite `n` being input by the user.
