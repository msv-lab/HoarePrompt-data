Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the string. If `char` is a lowercase letter and not in `current_set`, then `current_set` contains `char`, `current_count` is 1, and `max_count` is 0. If `char` is a lowercase letter and already in `current_set`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `char` is not a lowercase letter, then `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, and `current_count` is 0.**
