Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the string `s`. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` contains the third character in the string `s` in addition to its previous elements, and `current_count` is `current_count + 1`. Otherwise, `current_set`, `current_count`, and `max_count` remain unchanged.**
