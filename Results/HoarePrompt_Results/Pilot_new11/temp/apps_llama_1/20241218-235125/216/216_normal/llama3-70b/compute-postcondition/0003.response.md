The code `print(len(lowercase))` prints the length of the list `lowercase`, which contains the indices of lowercase characters in `s`. The variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The list `lowercase` also remains unchanged, but its length is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, with a length of `n`, `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`, and the length of `lowercase` is printed**
