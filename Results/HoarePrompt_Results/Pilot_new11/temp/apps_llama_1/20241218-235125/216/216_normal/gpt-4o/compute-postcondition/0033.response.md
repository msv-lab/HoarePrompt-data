The code updates the `max_count` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. This means `max_count` will now hold the maximum count of unique lowercase letters seen so far.

The values of `n`, `s`, `current_set`, and `current_count` are not changed by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `max_count` is the maximum count of unique lowercase letters seen so far, `current_set` is either empty or contains unique lowercase letters from the last sequence of lowercase letters in `s`, `current_count` is either 0 or represents the count of unique lowercase letters in the last sequence of lowercase letters in `s`.**
