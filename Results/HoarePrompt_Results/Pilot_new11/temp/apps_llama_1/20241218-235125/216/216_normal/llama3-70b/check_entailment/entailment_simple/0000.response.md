Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to determine the maximum number of elements in a "pretty" set of positions, where a set of positions is considered "pretty" if all letters at those positions are distinct and lowercase, and there are no uppercase letters between any two positions in the set.

However, the given program simply counts the total number of lowercase letters in the string and prints that count. This does not ensure that the letters are distinct or that there are no uppercase letters between any two positions.

For example, if the input string is "aaaa", the program will print 4, but according to the problem description, the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions should be 1, because all the letters are the same and there is no way to choose a set of distinct lowercase letters.

Another example is the input string "abABcd", the program will print 6, but the correct answer should be 2, because we can choose positions 0 and 2 (or any other positions with distinct lowercase letters) to form a pretty set.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the longest sequence of lowercase letters that are distinct and do not have uppercase letters in between. This can be achieved by iterating through the string, maintaining a set of distinct lowercase letters, and updating the maximum count whenever a new sequence is found. 

Here is a possible correct solution:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s[i].islower():
            if s[i] not in current_set:
                current_set.add(s[i])
                current_count += 1
                max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            else:
                current_set = set([s[i]])
                current_count = 1
            i += 1
        else:
            current_set = set()
            current_count = 0
            i += 1
    print(max_count)
```
