The code `current_set.add(char)` adds the value of `char` to `current_set`. 

Since `char` is the second character in the string `s`, `char` is equal to `s[1]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string, and `current_set` contains the second character of `s` (or `s[1]`).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `char` is `s[1]`, and `current_set` contains `s[1]`.**
