Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Inefficient Search Space**: The program uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of `x` and `y` up to 1,000,001. This is inefficient because the problem description only requires `x` and `y` to be between 1 and 10^9, and it does not guarantee that the correct solution will be within the first 1,000,001 iterations.

2. **Insufficient Validation**: The program checks if `x * y > max(a)` and breaks the inner loop if true, but it does not check if `x * y` is actually equal to the maximum value in `a` or if `x` and `y` can produce the sequence `a`. This can lead to incorrect solutions being missed.

3. **Incorrect Loop Termination**: The program uses `exit()` to terminate the program as soon as it finds a valid solution. However, the problem description does not guarantee that the first valid solution found is the only one or the correct one.

4. **Lack of Input Validation**: The program assumes that the input will always be valid and does not handle cases where the input is invalid, such as empty lists or negative integers.

5. **Inadequate Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases, such as when `x` or `y` is 1, or when the sequence `a` contains duplicate values.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to:

* Iterate over all possible combinations of `x` and `y` between 1 and 10^9.
* Validate each solution by checking if `x * y` is equal to the maximum value in `a` and if `x` and `y` can produce the sequence `a`.
* Handle edge cases, such as when `x` or `y` is 1, or when the sequence `a` contains duplicate values.
* Provide all possible solutions, not just the first one found.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def find_solution(n, a):
    max_val = max(a)
    for x in range(1, int(max_val ** 0.5) + 1):
        y = (max_val + x - 1) // x
        if x * y >= max_val and func_1(x, y, a):
            return x, y
    return None

def func_1(x, y, a):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py)!= 1:
            return False
        px, py = nx, ny
    return True

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
solution = find_solution(n, a)
if solution:
    print('YES')
    print(solution[0], solution[1])
else:
    print('NO')
