The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it will use three lines of input: 
- The first line contains a positive integer `n` representing the number of piles.
- The second line contains `n` non-negative integers `x_1, x_2,..., x_n` representing the number of stones in each pile on the first day.
- The third line contains `n` non-negative integers `y_1, y_2,..., y_n` representing the number of stones in each pile on the second day.
The return value is not provided, so we will describe the functionality based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three lines of input: the number of piles, the number of stones in each pile on the first day, and the number of stones in each pile on the second day, and processes this information for an unspecified output.**
