You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program checks if the sum of the stones in the two arrays is equal. If they are not equal, it prints 'No'. If they are equal, it sorts the two arrays and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. 

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that stones can be moved from one pile to another. The correctness of the program depends on the ability of the jury members to move stones from one pile to another, not just on the sum of the stones or the sorted order of the piles.

For example, consider the input:

3
2 3 0
2 2 1

In this case, the sum of the stones in the two arrays is equal, but the sorted order of the piles is not. However, it is possible for the jury members to move one stone from the second pile to the third pile to make the arrays equal. But the program will print 'No' because the sorted order of the piles is not equal.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if it is possible to move stones from one pile to another to make the arrays equal, not just check the sum of the stones or the sorted order of the piles. 

Here is a correct Python program for the problem:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x)!= sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
```
This program correctly checks if the sum of the stones in the two arrays is equal. If they are not equal, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This is because if the sum of the stones in the two arrays is equal, it is always possible for the jury members to move stones from one pile to another to make the arrays equal.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function checks if the distribution of stones in piles on two consecutive days is the same, regardless of the order of the piles. It accepts three lines of input: the number of piles (a positive integer between 1 and 50), the number of stones in each pile on the first day (a list of non-negative integers), and the number of stones in each pile on the second day (a list of non-negative integers). The function returns 'Yes' if the total number of stones and the distribution of stones are the same on both days, and 'No' otherwise. The function performs the following actions: reads the input, checks if the total number of stones is the same on both days, sorts the lists of stones if the total numbers are equal, and compares the sorted lists to determine if the distributions are the same. After the function executes, the program state includes the input variables (number of piles, stones on the first day, and stones on the second day), and the console output ('Yes' or 'No'), with the lists of stones potentially modified to be sorted if the total numbers were equal. The function handles edge cases where the total number of stones is not the same on both days, and where the distributions are the same or different.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
