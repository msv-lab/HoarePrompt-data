Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers with each integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `total_x` is an integer between 0 and 50000 (inclusive) equal to the sum of all elements in `x`, and `total_y` is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed.***
