The value of `total_x` is assigned the sum of all elements in the list `x`. The list `x` contains `n` integers between 0 and 1000 (inclusive). The maximum possible sum of `n` integers between 0 and 1000 is `n * 1000`, and the minimum possible sum is `0`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the maximum possible sum is `50 * 1000 = 50000`, and the minimum possible sum is `1 * 0 = 0`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers with each integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `total_x` is an integer between 0 and 50000 (inclusive) equal to the sum of all elements in `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is a list of integers with each integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `total_x` is an integer between 0 and 50000 (inclusive) equal to the sum of all elements in `x`.**
