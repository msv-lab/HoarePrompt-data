The code `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in ascending order. The sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y` before the execution of the code, and since sorting does not change the sum of the elements in a list, this property remains true after the execution of the code. The value of `n` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a sorted list of input integers, `y` is a list of input integers, and the sum of the elements in `x` is equal to the sum of the elements in `y`.**
