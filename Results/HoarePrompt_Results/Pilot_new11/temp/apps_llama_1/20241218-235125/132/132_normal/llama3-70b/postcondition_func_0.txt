The function checks if the distribution of stones in piles on two consecutive days is the same, regardless of the order of the piles. It accepts three lines of input: the number of piles (a positive integer between 1 and 50), the number of stones in each pile on the first day (a list of non-negative integers), and the number of stones in each pile on the second day (a list of non-negative integers). The function returns 'Yes' if the total number of stones and the distribution of stones are the same on both days, and 'No' otherwise. The function performs the following actions: reads the input, checks if the total number of stones is the same on both days, sorts the lists of stones if the total numbers are equal, and compares the sorted lists to determine if the distributions are the same. After the function executes, the program state includes the input variables (number of piles, stones on the first day, and stones on the second day), and the console output ('Yes' or 'No'), with the lists of stones potentially modified to be sorted if the total numbers were equal. The function handles edge cases where the total number of stones is not the same on both days, and where the distributions are the same or different.
