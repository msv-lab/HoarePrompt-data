Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem states that the participants want to know if their notes can be correct or if they are sure to have made a mistake, given the number of stones in the piles on the first and second visits.

The key insight here is that the jury members can either take one stone for themselves or move one stone from one pile to another. This means that the total number of stones in the piles can only decrease or remain the same between the first and second visits.

The program implements this insight by comparing the total number of stones in the piles on the first visit (`total_x`) with the total number of stones on the second visit (`total_y`). If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, it means that the number of stones has increased, which is not possible according to the problem description. In this case, the program prints 'No'.

On the other hand, if `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, it means that the number of stones has either decreased or remained the same, which is possible according to the problem description. In this case, the program prints 'Yes'.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
