Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program checks if the sum of the stones in the two arrays is equal. If they are not equal, it prints 'No'. If they are equal, it sorts the two arrays and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. 

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that stones can be moved from one pile to another. The correctness of the program depends on the ability of the jury members to move stones from one pile to another, not just on the sum of the stones or the sorted order of the piles.

For example, consider the input:

3
2 3 0
2 2 1

In this case, the sum of the stones in the two arrays is equal, but the sorted order of the piles is not. However, it is possible for the jury members to move one stone from the second pile to the third pile to make the arrays equal. But the program will print 'No' because the sorted order of the piles is not equal.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if it is possible to move stones from one pile to another to make the arrays equal, not just check the sum of the stones or the sorted order of the piles. 

Here is a correct Python program for the problem:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x)!= sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
```
This program correctly checks if the sum of the stones in the two arrays is equal. If they are not equal, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This is because if the sum of the stones in the two arrays is equal, it is always possible for the jury members to move stones from one pile to another to make the arrays equal.
