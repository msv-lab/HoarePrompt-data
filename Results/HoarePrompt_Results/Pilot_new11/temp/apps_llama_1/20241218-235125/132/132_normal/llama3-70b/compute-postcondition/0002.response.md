The code maps a list of input integers to a new list `y`. The initial state includes `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `x`, a list of input integers. 

After executing the code, `y` is assigned the value of the input integers split by spaces and converted to integers, while the values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `x` is a list of input integers, `y` is a list of input integers**
