The code `result = result * base + digit` updates the value of `result`. The initial value of `result` is the value of the second `digit`. After the update, `result` is equal to the initial `result` multiplied by `base` plus the second `digit`. 

Since `result` is initially equal to the second `digit`, and `digit` is the second digit in the list, `result` is equal to the second element in the `digits` list.

After the update, `result` is equal to the second element in the `digits` list multiplied by `base` plus the second element in the `digits` list.

The other variables are not affected by the update.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `digit` is the second digit in the list, `result` is equal to the second element in `digits` multiplied by `base` plus the second element in `digits`.**
