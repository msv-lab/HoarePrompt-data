Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly compares two numbers represented in different bases.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, storing the number of digits and base for both numbers X and Y, as well as the digits themselves.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` correctly converts a number from any given base to decimal. It does this by iterating over each digit in the number, from most significant to least significant, and calculates the decimal value by multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the current digit.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them and prints the correct comparison result ('<', '>', or '=').

The key to the program's correctness lies in its conversion function `func_1`. This function accurately implements the mathematical formula for converting a number from any base to decimal, which is the sum of each digit times the base raised to the power of its position from right to left, starting at 0.

Given that we assume the input will always be valid (i.e., the numbers will have the correct number of digits, the digits will be within the valid range for their respective bases, and the bases will be between 2 and 40 inclusive), the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
