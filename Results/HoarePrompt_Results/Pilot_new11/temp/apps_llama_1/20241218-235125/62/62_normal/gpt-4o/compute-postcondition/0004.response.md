The value of `decimal_value` is updated by multiplying its current value by `base` and adding the value of `digit`. The initial value of `decimal_value` is the first digit in the list, and `digit` is the second digit in the list. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`digits` is still a list of integers that must have at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1.

`decimal_value` is now equal to the first digit in the list multiplied by `base` plus the second digit in the list.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 digits, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= `base` <= 40, all elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1, `decimal_value` is equal to the first digit in the list multiplied by `base` plus the second digit in the list, `digit` is the second digit in the list**
