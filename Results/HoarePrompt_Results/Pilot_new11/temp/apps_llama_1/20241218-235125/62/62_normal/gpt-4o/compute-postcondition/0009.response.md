The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `digits` and `base`. `digits` is a list of integers, and `base` is an integer. The constraints on these parameters are such that `base` is between 2 and 40 (inclusive), and all elements of `digits` are integers between 0 and `base` - 1. After executing the function body, it returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits` and an integer `base`, and returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base`.**
