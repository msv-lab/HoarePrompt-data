Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It reads the input for two numbers in different bases, converts them to decimal, and compares their values. The conversion to decimal is done using the `func_1` function, which calculates the decimal value of a number in a given base by iterating over its digits and applying the formula for the place value of each digit.

To verify its correctness, let's break down the key steps and compare them against the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of digits and the base for each number, followed by the digits themselves. This matches the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` accurately converts a number from any given base to decimal. It does this by iterating through each digit from left to right (most significant to least significant), multiplying the current decimal value by the base, and then adding the value of the current digit. This process is mathematically sound for converting numbers from any base to decimal.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares their values and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on whether the first number is less than, greater than, or equal to the second number, respectively. This comparison logic aligns with the problem's requirements.

The examples provided in the problem description have been considered, and the program seems to handle them correctly:

- For the first example, both numbers are correctly converted to decimal (47 in base 10), and since they are equal, the program outputs '='.
- For the second example, the conversions to base 5 are implicitly considered (X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3), and the comparison shows that X < Y, resulting in the output '<'.
- For the third example, the base 16 and base 9 numbers are converted to decimal, and X is greater than Y, resulting in the output '>'.

Given the logic implemented in the program and its alignment with the problem's requirements, as well as the handling of the provided examples, it seems that the program functions as intended and is correct for all potential cases described in the problem. If a case exists where the program does not work as expected, it was not identified based on the provided description and examples.
