The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a conditional statement. Since we are directly inside a loop or conditional statement when this `break` statement is encountered, we exit that loop or conditional statement. 

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
