Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is an integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. For any `j` in the range `i + 1` to `n`, either `ratings_before[i] >= ratings_before[j]` or `ratings_after[i] <= ratings_after[j]`. The current value of `unrated` is `False`.**
