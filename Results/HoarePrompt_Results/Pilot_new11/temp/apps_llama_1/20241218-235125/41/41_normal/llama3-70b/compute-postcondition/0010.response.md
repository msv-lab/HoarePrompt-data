The code `ratings_after.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. The previous value of `ratings_after` was a list containing the updated input integer `b`. After appending `b` to `ratings_after`, it becomes a list containing two instances of the updated input integer `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing the updated input integers `a` and `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of the updated input integer `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
