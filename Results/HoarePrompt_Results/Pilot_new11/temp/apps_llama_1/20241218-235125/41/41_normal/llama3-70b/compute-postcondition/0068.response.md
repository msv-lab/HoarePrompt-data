Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `i` is an integer less than `n` and `i` is increased by 1, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `unrated` preserving its original value.***
