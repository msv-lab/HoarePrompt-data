The given Python code maps the input integers to `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are the first and second input integers respectively, they will be updated to these input values. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown but we do know that `ratings_before` is a list containing the updated input integers `a` and `a`, and `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of the updated input integer `b`. Now the values of `a` and `b` are overwritten with the new input. `n` is still an integer between 2 and 1000, and now `ratings_before` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `a`, and `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `b`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
