Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False`, `rated` is `False`, and there exists at least one pair of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, meaning not all elements in `ratings_before` are equal to the corresponding elements in `ratings_after` in a way that would make `unrated` `True`.**
