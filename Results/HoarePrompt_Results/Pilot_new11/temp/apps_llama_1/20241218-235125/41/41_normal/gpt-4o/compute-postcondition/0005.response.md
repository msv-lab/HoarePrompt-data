The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of two input integers to the variables `a` and `b`. The `map` function applies `int` to each item in the list returned by `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings separated by whitespace. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
