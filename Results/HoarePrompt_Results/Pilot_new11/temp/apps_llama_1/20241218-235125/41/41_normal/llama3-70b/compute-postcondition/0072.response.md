Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is an integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, and if there exists at least one `j` in the range `i + 1` to `n` for which `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `unrated` retains its original state.**
