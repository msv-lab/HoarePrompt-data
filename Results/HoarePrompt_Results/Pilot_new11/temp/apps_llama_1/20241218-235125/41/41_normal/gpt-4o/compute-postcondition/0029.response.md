To determine the output state, we need to consider the effects of the given code snippet on the initial state. 

The initial state is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `i` is 2, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`.

The code snippet is: `break`.

The `break` statement in Python is used to terminate the loop entirely. When the `break` statement is encountered, the loop stops, and the control flows to the statement that is immediate after the loop.

However, in this case, there's no loop provided in the code snippet to break out of. Given the context, the `break` statement seems to be standalone, which doesn't make sense in the absence of a loop. 

But following the instruction, we assume that a break occurs from the innermost loop that this statement is part of, even though the loop itself is not shown.

The variables and their states after the `break` statement are as follows:
- `n` remains an integer between 3 and 1000, inclusive.
- `ratings` remains a list of `n` tuples of integers.
- `i` remains 2.
- `is_rated` remains `False`.
- `is_unrated` remains `True`.
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `i` is 2, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
