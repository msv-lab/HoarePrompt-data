Functionality: **The function takes no arguments but reads a list of pairs of integers representing the rating of each participant before and after a round from the input, and then classifies the round as 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe' based on the ratings. It first determines if any participant's rating has changed by checking if any pair of elements in the 'ratings_before' and 'ratings_after' lists are not equal. If a change is found, it prints 'rated'. If no changes are found, it checks if the ratings before and after the round are in a consistent order (i.e., a participant with a lower initial rating does not end up with a higher final rating than a participant with a higher initial rating). If the order is consistent, it prints 'unrated'; otherwise, it prints 'maybe'. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-integer values, incorrect number of participants), and it assumes that the input is well-formed and that the number of participants is between 2 and 1000. After execution, the function will have printed one of 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe' to the console, indicating the classification of the round based on the input ratings.**
