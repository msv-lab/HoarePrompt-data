Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If `ratings_before[0]` is not equal to `ratings_after[0]`, then `rated` is `True`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False` if there exists a pair of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ratings_before[0]` is equal to `ratings_after[0]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `rated` being `False`, `maybe` being `True`, and `unrated` being `False` if there exists a pair of elements in `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` where `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`.***
