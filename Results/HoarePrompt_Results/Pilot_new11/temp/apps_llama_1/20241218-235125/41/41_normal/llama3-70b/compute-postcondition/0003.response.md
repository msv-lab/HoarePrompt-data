According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000, it is already guaranteed to be greater than 1. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. 

Before the loop starts, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are empty lists, but their state does not affect the execution of the loop. The loop will execute `n` times regardless of the state of these lists.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is an empty list, `ratings_after` is an empty list**
