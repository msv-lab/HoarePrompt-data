The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is designed to process a series of input lines. The input consists of a single integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `a_i` and `b_i` (where 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ 4126), representing the rating of the `i`-th participant before and after the round, respectively. 

However, since the function `func()` does not explicitly accept any parameters and the problem description does not specify the return value or the behavior based on the input provided, we cannot accurately describe its functionality without further information on how it processes the input data or what it returns.

Given the input structure and assuming the function is supposed to analyze or utilize the provided ratings in some manner, the functionality description would typically cover what the function returns or how it behaves based on the input ratings. Since the output or return behavior is not specified, we cannot provide a complete description of its functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any explicit parameters but is expected to process a series of input lines containing participant ratings before and after a round, though its return behavior or output is not specified.**
