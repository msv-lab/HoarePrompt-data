The code appends the value of `b` to the `ratings_after` list. The initial state has `ratings_after` as a list containing two instances of the input integer `b`. After appending `b`, the list will contain three instances of `b`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing three instances of the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing three instances of the input integer `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list containing three instances of the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing three instances of the input integer `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
