To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

1. **Given State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000.
   - `i` is an integer increased by 1.
   - `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers.
   - The condition related to `unrated` and the comparison between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` at different indices.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```
   for j in range(i + 1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   This loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `n`, meaning `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Adjusting States for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` needs to take on values from `i + 1` to `n - 1`. This implies `i` should be less than `n - 1` to ensure the loop has at least one iteration.
   - Since `n` is between 2 and 1000, and considering the loop's condition, `n` must be at least 3 or more for any iteration to occur when `i` is increased by 1 (as `i` starts at some value before the loop, and we're considering the scenario where `i` has been increased).
   - `i` is an integer increased by 1, which means its initial value before the loop starts must be such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, ensuring the loop can execute.
   - `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` being lists of `n` integers is a given state that supports the loop's execution by providing the necessary data for comparisons within the loop body (though the body is omitted).
   - The condition regarding `unrated` and the comparisons between `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` at different indices provides context but does not directly affect the loop's execution conditions.

Considering these points, the adjusted state for the loop to execute would focus on ensuring `i` and `n` are such that the loop can iterate over the specified range.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `i` is an integer less than `n - 1`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers**
