The code only changes the value of the variable `maybe`. The initial state of `maybe` is not specified, but since it's being assigned `True`, its new value is `True`. The other variables in the initial state (`n`, `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `rated`, `unrated`) are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `True`, `maybe` is `True`**
