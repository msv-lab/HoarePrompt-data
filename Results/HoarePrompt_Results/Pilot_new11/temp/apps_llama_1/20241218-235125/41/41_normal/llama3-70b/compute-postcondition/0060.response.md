Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `i` is an integer less than `n - 1`, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If there exists an index `j` such that `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If no such index `j` exists, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
