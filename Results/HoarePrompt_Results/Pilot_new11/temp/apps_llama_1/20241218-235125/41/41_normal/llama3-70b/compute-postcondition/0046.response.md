Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `i` is an integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
