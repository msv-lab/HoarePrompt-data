The given code snippet only contains a print statement, which does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is `False`, and `is_unrated` is `False`, and the string 'maybe' has been printed**
