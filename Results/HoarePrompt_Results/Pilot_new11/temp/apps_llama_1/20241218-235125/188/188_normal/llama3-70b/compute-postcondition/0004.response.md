According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, there is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100), `a` contains one integer element which is the input integer, `i` is 1**
