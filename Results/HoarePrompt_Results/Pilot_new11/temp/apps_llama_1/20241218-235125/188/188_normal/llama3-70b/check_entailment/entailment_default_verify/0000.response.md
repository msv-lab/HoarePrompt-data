The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it only checks for pairs of numbers where each number appears exactly n/2 times, which is a more restrictive condition than what the problem requires. However, the problem description explicitly states that the game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same, which implies that each player must have n/2 cards.

The output hints suggest that the program checks if there are exactly two integers that each appear n/2 times. This is consistent with the problem description and the provided code. The code counts the occurrences of each integer and checks if there are exactly two integers that each appear n/2 times. If such integers are found, it prints 'YES' followed by the two integers; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Upon re-examining the problem description and the provided code, I believe that the original assessment is not entirely accurate. The program does handle the case where two distinct numbers appear exactly n/2 times, which is the only case required by the problem description. The program does not handle cases where more than two numbers can be chosen such that the total number of cards with those numbers is equal to n/2, but this is not a requirement of the problem.

The output hints suggest that the program provides the correct output for the given input, and the code correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
