Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is the first integer with a count of `n // 2`, `a2` is the second integer with a count of `n // 2`, the current values of `a1` and `a2` are not equal to -1, indicating that there are at least two integers in `a` with a count of `n // 2`.**
