The value of `a2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is the next key in `d` after the current one. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d` after the current one, `a2` is equal to `i`**
