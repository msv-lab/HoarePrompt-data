Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d` after the current one. If `c` is 0, then `a1` is equal to `i` and `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a2` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
