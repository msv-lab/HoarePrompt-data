Correctness: **True**

The code accurately implements the problem description. It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and checks if there are exactly two integers that each appear `n/2` times. The code handles the case where no such integers are found, printing "NO". If two such integers are found, it prints "YES" followed by the two integers.

The code handles all the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For instance, when the input is:

```
4
11
27
27
11
```

The code correctly outputs:

```
YES
11 27
```

The code also handles edge cases such as when all the input integers are the same. In this case, it prints "NO" because Petya and Vasya cannot choose distinct integers.

The code assumes valid input, as stated in the problem description, and does not attempt to handle invalid input. However, under the assumption of valid input, the code is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible cases. 

The code iterates through the input integers, counts their occurrences, and checks if any two integers appear `n/2` times. This approach ensures that the code will correctly determine whether a fair game is possible, as per the problem description. 

Therefore, based on the provided code, problem description, and examples, it can be concluded that the code is correct for all potential cases.
