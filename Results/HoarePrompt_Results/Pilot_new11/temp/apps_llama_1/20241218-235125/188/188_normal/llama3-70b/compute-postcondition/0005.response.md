The code appends an input integer to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one integer element which is the input integer, and `i` is 1. After the code is executed, `a` will have two elements: the initial input integer and the newly input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, there is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100), `a` contains two integer elements which are input integers, `i` is 1**
