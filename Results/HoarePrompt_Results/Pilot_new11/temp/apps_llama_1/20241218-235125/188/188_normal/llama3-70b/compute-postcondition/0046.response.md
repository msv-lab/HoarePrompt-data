The value of `c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d` after the current one, `a1` is equal to `i`, and `c` is increased by 1.
