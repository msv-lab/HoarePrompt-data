Postcondition: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique integers in `cards` sorted by their frequencies in ascending order. The current value of `unique_numbers` has less than 2 elements, meaning `cards` contains either no unique integers or only one unique integer.**
