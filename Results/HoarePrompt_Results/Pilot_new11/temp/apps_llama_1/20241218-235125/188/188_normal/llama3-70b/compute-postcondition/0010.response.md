To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` input integers.
- `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0 and is undefined if `n` is 0.
- `d` is an empty dictionary.

Loop statement: 
```python
for i in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `a` must be iterable, which is already the case since `a` is a list.
2. The loop will iterate over each element in `a`. Since `a` contains `n` input integers, for the loop to start executing, `a` must not be empty, implying `n` must be greater than 0.

Adjusting the states based on the above analysis:
- Since `n` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer.
- `a` must have at least one element for the loop to start, which aligns with `n` being greater than 0.
- `i` will take the value of the first element in `a` during the first iteration. Since `i` was initially `n-1` when `n` is greater than 0, its state needs to be adjusted to the first element of `a`.
- The state of `d` remains unchanged as it does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `a`, `d` is an empty dictionary**
