The code creates a Counter object, which is a dictionary subclass for counting hashable objects. The `Counter(cards)` expression counts the frequency of each integer in the `cards` list.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `count` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `cards` and the values are their respective frequencies in `cards`**
