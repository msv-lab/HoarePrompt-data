Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of cards `n` and then reads the numbers on the cards.
2. It counts the frequency of each number on the cards using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
3. It sorts the unique numbers on the cards based on their frequencies in ascending order.
4. If there is only one unique number on the cards, it prints 'NO' because the game cannot be fair if both players choose the same number.
5. If there are two or more unique numbers on the cards, it checks if the most frequent and the second most frequent numbers have the same frequency, which is equal to `n // 2`. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES' along with the most and second most frequent numbers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program handles all cases as described in the problem description. If there are multiple solutions, the program prints one of them, which is allowed according to the problem description. 

One potential issue could be that the program assumes that the input will be valid, which is stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not need to handle cases where the input is invalid.

In summary, the program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as required.
