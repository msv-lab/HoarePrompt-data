The function determines if a given sequence of n integers can be divided into two groups of equal size, each containing the same integer. It accepts a sequence of n integers as input, where n is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function returns 'YES' if the input sequence can be divided into two groups of equal size with the same integer, and it prints the two integers that make up the groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function performs the following actions: (1) reads the input sequence of n integers, (2) counts the frequency of each integer in the sequence, (3) sorts the unique integers in ascending order of their frequencies, and (4) checks if the frequency of the most frequent integer and the second most frequent integer is equal to n // 2. If the input sequence contains less than 2 unique integers, the function immediately returns 'NO'. After executing, the program has the following state: the input sequence has been processed, and either 'YES' with the two integers that make up the groups or 'NO' has been printed to the console, depending on whether the input sequence meets the specified condition.
