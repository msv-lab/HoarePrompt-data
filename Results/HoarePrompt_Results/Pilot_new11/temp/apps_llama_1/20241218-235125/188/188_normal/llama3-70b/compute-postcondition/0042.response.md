Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d`. If `c` equals 0, then `a1` equals `i` and `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a2` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
