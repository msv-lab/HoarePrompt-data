The code introduces two new variables, `a1` and `a2`, and assigns them the value `-1`. The values of `n`, `a`, `d`, and `c` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1**
