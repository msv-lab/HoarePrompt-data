To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement and the initial program state.

The loop statement is `for i in d:`, where `d` is a dictionary. This indicates that the loop will iterate over the keys in dictionary `d`.

Given the initial program state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` input integers.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`.
- `c` is 0.
- `a1` is -1.
- `a2` is -1.

For the loop to execute, it depends on the contents of dictionary `d`. If `d` is not empty, meaning it contains at least one key-value pair (which corresponds to at least one unique integer in `a`), then the loop can execute.

At the start of the loop, `i` would be the first key in `d`. The order of keys in a dictionary can be arbitrary in Python versions before 3.7, but in Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries remember the order of items inserted. Assuming the latest Python version for consistency, `i` would be the first key inserted into `d`, which would be one of the unique integers from `a`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- `d` must not be empty, implying `a` must have at least one integer.
- `i` would take the value of the first key in `d`, which is one of the unique integers from `a`.
- The states of `n`, `a`, `c`, `a1`, and `a2` do not directly affect the loop's ability to start executing but are part of the overall program state.

So, the adjusted state for the loop to execute would be:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is -1, `i` is the first key in `d`**
