You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
11
27
27
11

Output
YES
11 27

Input
2
6
6

Output
NO

Input
6
10
20
30
20
10
20

Output
NO

Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    c = 0
    (a1, a2) = (-1, -1)
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
    if a1 != -1 and a2 != -1:
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the following case:

Input:
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

In this case, the program will print 'NO' which is correct, but the reason is not handled correctly in the program. The program only checks for the cases where two distinct numbers appear exactly n/2 times. However, it should also check for cases where more than two numbers can be chosen such that the total number of cards with those numbers is equal to n/2. 

For example, in this case, if we choose the number 1 and 2, we get two cards each, and if we choose the number 3, we can't get two cards with the remaining number. But the program does not handle such cases.

However, the main issue is that the program only checks for the first pair of numbers that appear exactly n/2 times, and it doesn't check if there are any other pairs. But more importantly, the program doesn't check if the numbers that appear n/2 times are distinct, which is not sufficient for a correct solution. 

But more specifically this program does not handle cases where more than two numbers appear with frequency greater than 0 but less than n/2. For example, if the input is 4, 1, 2, 1, 2 then this program will print NO because it only checks the first occurrence of n/2. The correct approach would be to find two distinct numbers with a total of n cards, not necessarily with equal frequency. 

So a more accurate case where this program fails would be the numbers 1 and 2 both appearing exactly n/2 times which in this case is not necessary because two numbers are sufficient regardless if they have the same frequency.

For example if the numbers are 
1
1
1
2
2
2

In this case the program should return "NO" because no two numbers appear exactly 3 times, but it will return "YES" and print 1 and 2 which is incorrect according to the definition of the problem.

In this case, a solution could be checking for pairs of numbers with different frequencies that sum up to n, in this case n/2 + n/2 = n, which is still insufficient for proving that this program is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem we should find all numbers with a frequency greater than 0, then try all possible distinct pairs of those numbers and check if their frequencies sum to n. 

Another potential case is that this program does not handle empty input which could cause an error. 

Another potential case could be an extremely large input, but because of the constraints given in the problem statement (n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100), the time complexity is not a major issue here.

A possible solution to correctly solve the problem is to iterate over all pairs of distinct numbers, check their frequencies, and return "YES" if we find a pair with frequencies that sum up to n, and return "NO" otherwise. 

This program, however, only checks for pairs where each number appears n/2 times, which is a more restrictive condition than what the problem requires, and also does not handle cases with more than two numbers correctly, and more importantly it assumes that if a number appears n/2 times then there is another distinct number that also appears n/2 times, which is not the case for this problem.

However, if the program is modified to correctly handle all cases as mentioned before, it would be considered correct, but in its current form, there are several cases where the program does not work as expected, which makes it incorrect according to the problem description. 

For example if the input is 
4
1
1
2
2

Then the program will return YES and print 1 and 2, which is correct according to the definition of the problem, but this does not mean that this program is correct. It only means that for this specific input the program works correctly, but for other inputs it does not work as expected.

In conclusion, while this program works correctly for some inputs, there are several cases where it does not work correctly, which makes it an incorrect solution according to the problem description. 

This program should be revised to correctly handle all cases as described before.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even number, and there is a list of n integers (each between 1 and 100) representing the numbers written on the cards.

    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))

    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is either -1 or the first integer with a count of `n // 2`, `a2` is either -1 or the second integer with a count of `n // 2`.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is either -1 or the first integer with a count of `n // 2`, `a2` is either -1 or the second integer with a count of `n // 2`. If both `a1` and `a2` are not -1, 'YES' has been printed to the console along with the values of `a1` and `a2`. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console.
