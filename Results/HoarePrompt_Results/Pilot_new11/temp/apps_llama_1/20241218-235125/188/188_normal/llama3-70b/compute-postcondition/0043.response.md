Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d`. If `d[i]` equals `n // 2`, then if `c` equals 0, `a1` equals `i` and `c` is increased by 1, otherwise `a2` equals `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. If `d[i]` does not equal `n // 2`, no changes are made.***
