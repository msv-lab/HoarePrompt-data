Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. A case where the program fails is when there are two distinct numbers with the same frequency that is equal to half of the total number of cards, but they are not necessarily the two numbers with the highest frequencies.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1
2
1
2
```
The program will print 'NO' because it only checks if the two numbers with the highest frequencies have counts equal to half of the total number of cards. However, in this case, the numbers 1 and 2 both have counts equal to half of the total number of cards, and they are distinct.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check all pairs of distinct numbers and their counts, not just the two numbers with the highest frequencies. 

Here is a possible correction:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    for num1 in count:
        for num2 in count:
            if num1!= num2 and count[num1] == n // 2 and count[num2] == n // 2:
                print('YES')
                print(num1, num2)
                return
    print('NO')
```
This modified program checks all pairs of distinct numbers and their counts, and prints 'YES' and the two numbers if it finds a pair with counts equal to half of the total number of cards. If it does not find such a pair, it prints 'NO'.
