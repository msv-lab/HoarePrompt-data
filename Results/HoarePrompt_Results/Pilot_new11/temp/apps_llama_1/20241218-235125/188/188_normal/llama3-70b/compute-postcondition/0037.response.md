To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the keys in dictionary `d`. For the loop to execute again, `d` must have at least one more key after the current key `i`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` input integers and must have at least 1 integer.
   - `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique integer from `a`.
   - `i` is the first key in `d`.
   - The operations inside the loop body regarding `c`, `a1`, and `a2` do not affect the loop's iteration condition directly. They depend on the value of `d[i]` and the current value of `n`, but they do not change the fact that `i` needs to move to the next key in `d` for the loop to continue.

3. **Next Iteration Conditions**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the keys of `d`, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must have more than one key (since `i` is currently the first key), meaning `d` must have at least 2 keys.
   - `i` should move to the next key in `d`. Since dictionary iterations are based on the keys' hash values and not necessarily their numerical order, we can simply say `i` becomes the next key in `d` without specifying its value.
   - The state of `n`, `a`, `c`, `a1`, and `a2` does not directly influence the loop's ability to execute again but is relevant for the loop body's operations.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer.
   - `a` remains a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer.
   - `d` must have at least 2 key-value pairs for the loop to continue.
   - `i` becomes the next key in `d`.

Given these considerations:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from `a`, `i` is the next key in `d`**
