The code appends an input integer to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two integer elements which are input integers. After executing the code, `a` will contain three integer elements. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an input integer greater than 2, the list of `n` integers remains unchanged, and `i` is still 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, there is a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100), `a` contains three integer elements which are input integers, `i` is 2**
