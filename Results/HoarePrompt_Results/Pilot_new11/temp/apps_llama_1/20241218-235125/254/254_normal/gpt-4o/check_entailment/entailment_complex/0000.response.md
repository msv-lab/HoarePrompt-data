Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks to determine if it is possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. However, the program simply checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals is 1, and prints 'YES' if it is, and 'NO' otherwise.

This approach is not correct because it does not consider the actual problem of choosing the moments of time to switch on the garlands. The GCD of the time intervals being 1 does not guarantee that it is possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit.

For example, if the time intervals are 4, 2, and 3, the GCD of the time intervals is 1, but it is not possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. This is because there will always be some seconds when no garland is lit, no matter what moments of time are chosen to switch on the garlands.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect. 

The correct approach would be to check if there exists a set of moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. This can be done by iterating over all possible moments of time and checking if the condition is met.

Here is an example of how the correct program could look like:
```python
def func():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    for x1 in range(1, max(k1, k2, k3) + 1):
        for x2 in range(1, max(k1, k2, k3) + 1):
            for x3 in range(1, max(k1, k2, k3) + 1):
                max_x = max(x1, x2, x3)
                if all(any((x - max_x) % ki == 0 for ki in [k1, k2, k3]) for x in range(max_x, max_x + max(k1, k2, k3) + 1)):
                    print('YES')
                    return
    print('NO')
```
This program checks all possible moments of time to switch on the garlands and prints 'YES' if it finds a set of moments of time that meets the condition, and 'NO' otherwise.
