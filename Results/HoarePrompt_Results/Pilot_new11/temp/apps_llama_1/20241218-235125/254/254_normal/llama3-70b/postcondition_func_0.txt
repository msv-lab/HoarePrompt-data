The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input positive integers `a` and `b`, both within the range of 1 to 1500, using the Euclidean algorithm. The function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their GCD, leaving the original values of `a` and `b` modified within the function scope. Note that the function does not consider or modify a third parameter `c`, despite its mention in the annotations, as it is not actually passed to the function. The return value is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, which is `a` after the function's loop execution, with `b` being 0. The function handles all potential cases for `a` and `b` within the specified range and correctly computes their GCD.
