Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires that there should be at least one lit garland during each second after switching the garlands on. The code provided attempts to solve this problem by calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the three garland's time intervals (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`) and checking if the LCM is a multiple of each individual time interval.

However, the code does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks if the LCM is a multiple of each time interval, but this does not guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland during each second.

A counterexample can be found in the input `4 2 3`, where the code incorrectly prints `NO` when it should actually print `NO` (this example indeed shows that there is no way to choose moments of time for switching the garlands on such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit), however, another counterexample is the input `5 10 15`, the LCM of these numbers is `150` and it is a multiple of `5`, `10`, and `15`, however, there will be seconds when none of the garlands are lit.

The issue with the code is that it only checks if the LCM is a multiple of each time interval, but it does not consider the actual timing of the garlands. It should check if there is a way to switch the garlands on such that each second is covered by at least one garland.

In general, the problem requires a more complex solution that involves checking all possible combinations of switching times and verifying if each second is covered by at least one garland. The provided code does not meet this requirement, and therefore, it is incorrect.
