Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code attempts to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three input numbers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` and then checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the numbers. However, this approach does not correctly determine if there are moments of time when all three garlands can be switched on such that at least one garland is lit every second after switching.

The annotated version of the code provides more insight into the function `func_1`, which calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input positive integers `a` and `b`. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD, which is correct. However, the main issue with the code lies in the logic of calculating the LCM and checking if it is divisible by each of the numbers.

The code does not attempt to find specific times `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` when the garlands should be switched on, which is the main goal of the problem. Instead, it relies on the LCM being divisible by each of the numbers, which is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that every second will have at least one lit garland.

The example provided in the original assessment, where the inputs are `5 5 7`, demonstrates the flaw in the code. The code calculates the LCM as `35`, which is divisible by `5`, `5`, and `7`, so it prints "YES". However, upon examination, it is not possible to choose `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` such that every second after switching has at least one lit garland.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The code does not correctly solve the problem, and the LCM being divisible by each of the numbers is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that every second will have at least one lit garland.

Final: **False**
