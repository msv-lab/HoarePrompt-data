You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue is with the way it calculates the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the three garland intervals and uses it to determine if it's possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one is lit every second.

The problem in the code is that it only checks if the LCM is divisible by each of the intervals, which is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit every second.

For example, if the input is 2, 4, 3, the program will calculate the LCM as 12 and then check if 12 is divisible by 2, 4, and 3. Although 12 is divisible by all three, the program will still print 'NO' because of the way it checks the divisibility.

However, a correct approach would be to check all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verify if there is at least one second in which no garland is lit.

A counterexample to the given program is the input 2, 2, 3. The program will print 'YES', which is correct. However, if we modify the code to calculate the LCM correctly and check the divisibility, we can find a case where the program fails.

Let's consider the input 3, 4, 5. The LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60. The program will calculate the LCM correctly but will print 'NO' because it does not correctly check if it's possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one is lit every second.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to check all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verify if there is at least one second in which no garland is lit. 

Here's an example of a correct Python program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def solve():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    for x1 in range(k1):
        for x2 in range(k2):
            for x3 in range(k3):
                possible = True
                max_time = max(x1, x2, x3)
                for time in range(max_time, max_time + k1 * k2 * k3):
                    if (time - x1) % k1!= 0 and (time - x2) % k2!= 0 and (time - x3) % k3!= 0:
                        possible = False
                        break
                if possible:
                    print('YES')
                    return
    print('NO')

solve()
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input positive integers `a` and `b`, both within the range of 1 to 1500, using the Euclidean algorithm. The function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their GCD, leaving the original values of `a` and `b` modified within the function scope. Note that the function does not consider or modify a third parameter `c`, despite its mention in the annotations, as it is not actually passed to the function. The return value is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, which is `a` after the function's loop execution, with `b` being 0. The function handles all potential cases for `a` and `b` within the specified range and correctly computes their GCD.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
