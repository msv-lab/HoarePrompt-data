The code given is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This statement does not affect the values of any variables. 

The values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `gcd_k1_k2`, and `gcd_all` remain unchanged. `k1` is still an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, and `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, and `gcd_all` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3` and is greater than 1, and 'NO' has been printed**
