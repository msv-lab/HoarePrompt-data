To calculate the impact of the code on the program, we first need to understand what the code does. The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `k1` and `k2` using the `math.gcd()` function and assigns it to the variable `gcd_k1_k2`.

Given that `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers between 1 and 1500 (inclusive), the GCD of `k1` and `k2` will be an integer as well, because the GCD of two integers is always an integer.

So, the value of `gcd_k1_k2` will be the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, which means it will be an integer between 1 and the minimum of `k1` and `k2`, because the GCD cannot be greater than the smallest of the two numbers.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, and `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.
Output State: **`k1` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k2` is an integer between 1 and 1500, `k3` is an integer between 1 and 1500, and `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.**
