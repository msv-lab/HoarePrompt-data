Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$ that sum up to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$, where $b_i$ divides $n$ and $1 < b_i < n$. However, the code simply lists all divisors of $n$ and their corresponding fractions, without checking if they sum up to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$.

For example, if the input is $n = 6$, the code will output $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$, which indeed sum up to $1 - \frac{1}{6}$. However, if the input is $n = 8$, the code will output $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$, which do not sum up to $1 - \frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the code does not work correctly for every potential case.

The code is missing the crucial step of checking if the sum of the fractions is equal to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$, and it does not provide a correct sequence of fractions for every possible input.
