To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the return statement.

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2. This means `n` can be any integer from 3 to 10^9.
- `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, which is the integer part of the square root of `n`.
- `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor). This implies that `divisors` includes pairs of numbers that divide `n` without leaving a remainder, where at least one number in each pair is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
- `k` is the number of elements in `divisors`, meaning it counts how many divisors and their quotients are listed for `n`.
- `fractions` is a list of tuples of the form `(1, d)` for each `d` in `divisors`. However, the definition of `fractions` seems to be based on the divisors without considering the quotient pairs directly. Instead, it focuses on creating fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor `d` as the denominator.

Given the return statement:
```python
return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
```

This statement returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by a newline, then the number of elements `k` in `divisors`, another newline, and finally a list of fractions where each fraction is represented as two space-separated numbers (1 and a divisor) per line.

Considering the information:
- The first line of the output will always be 'YES'.
- The second line will be the count of divisors (and their quotients, if distinct) up to the square root of `n`, which is `k`.
- The subsequent lines will list fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor `d` of `n` (up to its square root) as the denominator, one fraction per line.

Output State: **The program returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors and their quotients up to the square root of `n`, and then lists fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor `d` of `n` as the denominator, where `n` is an integer strictly larger than 2 and the divisors are considered up to the square root of `n`.**
