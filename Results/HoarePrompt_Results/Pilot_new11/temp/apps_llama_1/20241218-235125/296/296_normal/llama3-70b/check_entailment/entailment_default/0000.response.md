Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem. For instance, it doesn't properly calculate the sequence of fractions according to the given conditions. Specifically, the code doesn't ensure that the sum of the fractions equals `1 - 1/n` as required, and the fractions `1/(n//2)` and `1/n` may not meet the conditions specified in the problem description.

For example, if `n = 6`, the code will output `1/3` and `1/6`, but the sum of these fractions does not equal `1 - 1/6`, which is the expected result. A correct solution for `n = 6` would involve finding fractions that sum to `5/6`, such as `1/2` and `1/3`.

The code seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the problem requirements and does not properly address the conditions for the sequence of fractions. It does not check whether `n//2` and `n` are valid denominators that divide `n` and whether the sum of the fractions equals `1 - 1/n`.

To fix this, the code should be revised to correctly implement the logic for finding the sequence of fractions that satisfy the given conditions. This involves ensuring that each `b_i` divides `n`, each `a_i` is less than `b_i`, and the sum of the fractions equals `1 - 1/n`. The current implementation does not meet these requirements and therefore is incorrect.
