Functionality: **This function determines if a given integer `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself, and if so, lists these divisors and their corresponding fractions. The function accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^9 and returns either 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or has no divisors other than 1 and itself, or a string that confirms the presence of divisors, lists them, and includes their corresponding fractions. The function considers divisors up to the square root of `n`, ensuring that all divisors are found due to the mathematical property that a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been accounted for. If divisors are found, the function returns a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the count of divisors (including their corresponding quotients if they are not equal to the divisor), and then lists fractions with 1 as the numerator and each divisor as the denominator. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 2, and where `n` is a prime number (i.e., has no divisors other than 1 and itself), returning 'NO' in these cases.**
