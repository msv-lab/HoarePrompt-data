Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply generates all divisors of the input number `n` and creates fractions with numerator 1 and denominator equal to each divisor. However, it does not check if the sum of these fractions equals `1 - 1/n`.

For example, when `n = 6`, the program correctly outputs `YES` and provides the sequence `1/2` and `1/3`, which indeed sums up to `1 - 1/6`. However, for `n = 4`, the program outputs `YES` and provides the sequence `1/2` and `1/4`, but the sum of these fractions is `3/4`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/4 = 3/4`. Although in this case, the program happens to work correctly, it is not the case for all inputs.

But, for `n = 5`, the program outputs `YES` and provides the sequence `1/5`, but the sum of this fraction is `1/5`, which is not equal to `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. This shows that the program does not work correctly for all inputs.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should find a sequence of fractions that sums up to `1 - 1/n`, which is not guaranteed by the current implementation. 

The current implementation only checks for divisors of `n` and generates fractions with numerator 1, which is not sufficient to solve the problem. A correct solution would require a more complex approach to find the correct sequence of fractions. 

The program could be improved by using a more sophisticated algorithm to find the sequence of fractions, such as using a greedy approach or dynamic programming. However, the current implementation is not correct and does not solve the problem as described.
