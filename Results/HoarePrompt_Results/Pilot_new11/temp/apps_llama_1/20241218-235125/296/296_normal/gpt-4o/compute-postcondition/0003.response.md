The code initializes an empty list `divisors`. This list will be used to store the divisors of a number, but at this point, it is empty.

The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and `n` is strictly larger than 2. This condition is still valid after the code is executed.

The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the only change is the introduction of the `divisors` list, which is currently empty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `divisors` is an empty list**
