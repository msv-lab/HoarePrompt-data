Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One example is when `n` is a prime number greater than 2. In this case, `n // 2` is not a divisor of `n` and the printed sequence does not satisfy the condition `b_i divides n`.

For instance, if the input is `n = 5`, the program will output:

```
YES
2
1 2
1 5
```

However, `2` does not divide `5`, so this is not a valid sequence according to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is not correct and does not work for all potential cases.
