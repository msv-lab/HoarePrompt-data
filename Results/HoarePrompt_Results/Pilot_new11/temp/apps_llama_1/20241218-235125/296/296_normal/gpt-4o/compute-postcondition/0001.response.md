Given that the current value of `n` is less than or equal to 2, and considering the constraint that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9, it seems there might be a contradiction because the initial condition states `n` is less than or equal to 2, which includes 1, but the constraint starts from 2. However, focusing on the provided code and initial state:

The code simply returns the string 'NO', regardless of the value of `n`. The condition and value of `n` do not affect the return statement in this case.

Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**
