The code snippet generates a new list `fractions` containing tuples of the form `(1, d)` for each `d` in `divisors`. 

The value of `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2. 
The value of `i` remains `int(math.sqrt(n))`. 
The list `divisors` still contains all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor), and `divisors` is not empty. 
The value of `k` remains the number of elements in `divisors`. 
A new list `fractions` is created and contains tuples of the form `(1, d)` for each `d` in `divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor), `divisors` is not empty, `k` is the number of elements in `divisors`, and `fractions` is a list of tuples of the form `(1, d)` for each `d` in `divisors`**.
