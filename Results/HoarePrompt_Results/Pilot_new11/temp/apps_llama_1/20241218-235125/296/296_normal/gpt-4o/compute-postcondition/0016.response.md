According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 4. 

Additionally, if `n` is divisible by 3 and `n` is not equal to 9, then `divisors` is a list that includes the values 3 and `n // 3`. For the loop to execute again, this condition on `n` and `divisors` remains the same, but since `n` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 4, the possible values of `n` are adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= int(math.sqrt(n)) <= int(math.sqrt(10^9)) and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is 4, `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 4. If `n` is divisible by 3, then if `n` is not equal to 9, `divisors` is a list that includes the values 3 and `n // 3`**
