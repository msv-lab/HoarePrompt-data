To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it appends `i` to the `divisors` list. If `i` is not equal to `n // i`, it also appends `n // i` to the `divisors` list.

From the provided output states, we can observe the following patterns:

* The loop executes at least once if `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, and `int(math.sqrt(n))` is at least 2.
* If `n` is divisible by `i`, the `divisors` list includes the values `i` and `n // i` (if `i` is not equal to `n // i`).
* The `divisors` list includes all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `divisors` list will include all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n`, and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor).

The final value of `i` will be equal to the last number in the range, which is `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

The loop will not execute if `n` is less than 2 or if `int(math.sqrt(n))` is less than 2. In this case, the `divisors` list will remain empty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `n` is strictly larger than 2, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n))`, `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n` and their corresponding quotients (if they are not equal to the divisor). If `n` is less than 2 or `int(math.sqrt(n))` is less than 2, `divisors` is an empty list.**
