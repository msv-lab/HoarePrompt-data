According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2` (if `total` is less than `s`) or remains 0 (if `total` is not less than `s`), and `high` is `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2 - 1` (if `total` is not less than `s`). 

In order for the loop to execute again, `low` must be less than `high`. So, if `low` is 0, then `high` must be greater than 0. If `low` is `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2`, then `high` must be greater than `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2`. 

Since `high` is updated to `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2 - 1` when `total` is not less than `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `total` must be less than `s` when `low` is `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2`, so that `low` is not updated to a value greater than or equal to `high`. 

Also, since `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0, `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2` is at least 1, so `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2 - 1` is at least 0.

Considering all these conditions, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0, `mid` is `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2`, `total` is `mid * len(v)`, `low` is less than `high`**
