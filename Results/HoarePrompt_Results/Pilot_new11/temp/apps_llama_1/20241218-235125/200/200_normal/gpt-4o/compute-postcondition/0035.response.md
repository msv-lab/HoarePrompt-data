The value of `min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting the result of the expression `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` from its current value. The previous values of the other variables are not changed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, `i` is the last index that was processed, and the current value of `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0.**
