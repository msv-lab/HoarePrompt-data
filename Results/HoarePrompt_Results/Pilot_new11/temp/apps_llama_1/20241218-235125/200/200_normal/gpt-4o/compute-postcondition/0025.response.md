Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 1, and if `remaining_kvass` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution with the updated values of `remaining_kvass` and other variables***
