Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the original input integer, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is the sum of the integers in `volumes` and is larger than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is the last index that was processed, and the current value of `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, which is either the remaining value after `n` iterations or the break condition, and all previous conditions related to these variables still hold.**
