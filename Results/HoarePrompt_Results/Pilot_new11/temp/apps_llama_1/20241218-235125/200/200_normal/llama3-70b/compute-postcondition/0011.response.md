Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0, `mid` is `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2`, `total` is `mid * len(v)`. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is updated to `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `(the smallest element in `v` + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `low` remains 0.**
