Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a sorted list of integers with all elements greater than 0. If `total` is less than `s`, then `low` equals `mid` equals `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `high` is greater than `low`, and `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `mid` and each element in `v`. Otherwise, `low` is strictly less than `mid - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high + 1) // 2`, `high` is `mid - 1`, and `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `mid` and each element in `v`.***
