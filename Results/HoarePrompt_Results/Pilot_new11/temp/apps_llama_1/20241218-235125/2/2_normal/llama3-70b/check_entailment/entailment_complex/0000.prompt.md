You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Anton has the integer x. He is interested what positive integer, which doesn't exceed x, has the maximum sum of digits.

Your task is to help Anton and to find the integer that interests him. If there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the integer which Anton has. 


-----Output-----

Print the positive integer which doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are several such integers, print the biggest of them. Printed integer must not contain leading zeros.


-----Examples-----
Input
100

Output
99

Input
48

Output
48

Input
521

Output
499
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input variables are explicitly defined in the function, but based on the problem description, we can infer that the function should operate on a positive integer x, such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        
        if digit_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `x`, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of digits of any number in the range from 1 to `x`, and `max_num` is the number in the range from 1 to `x` whose digits sum up to `max_sum`.
    print(max_num)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer input from the user, calculates the sum of digits for each number in the range from 1 to the input number, and returns the number whose digits sum up to the maximum value. If there are multiple numbers with the same maximum sum of digits, it returns the first one encountered in the range. The function handles input values ranging from 1 to 10^18, although it may be limited by the system's input processing capabilities. The function does not handle non-integer or non-positive inputs, which may cause it to fail or produce incorrect results. After execution, the program's state is defined by the output of the maximum number, and the input variable is discarded. The function does not modify any external state or have any side effects beyond printing the result.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
