Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem statement requires that if there are multiple such integers with the same maximum sum of digits, the program should output the largest of them. However, the code returns the first one encountered in the range, not necessarily the largest. 

For example, if the input is 999, the code will return 9 (which is the first number with the maximum sum of digits), but the correct output should be 999 because 999 is larger than 9 and both have the same maximum sum of digits. 

This example shows that the code does not work correctly for all potential cases.
