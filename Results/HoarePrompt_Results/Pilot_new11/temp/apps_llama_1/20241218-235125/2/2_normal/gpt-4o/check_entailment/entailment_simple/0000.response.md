Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. 

In the problem description, it is stated that if there are several integers with the maximum sum of digits, the program should print the biggest of them. However, the program does not always guarantee this.

One case where the program fails to follow the problem description is when the input `x` has a maximum sum of digits among all numbers less than or equal to `x`. In this case, the program correctly calculates the sum of digits of `x` and the candidate number. However, if the sum of digits of `x` is greater than the sum of digits of the candidate number, the program prints `x`. But it does not check if there is another number less than `x` with the same maximum sum of digits. 

For example, if the input is `999`, the program will correctly calculate the sum of digits of `999` as `27`. The candidate number in this case is `899`. The sum of digits of `899` is `26`, which is less than `27`. So the program will print `999`, which is correct. However, if the input is `998`, the program will calculate the sum of digits of `998` as `26`. The candidate number in this case is still `899`. The sum of digits of `899` is `26`, which is equal to the sum of digits of `998`. But the program will still print `998`, not `999` or any other number greater than `899` but less than `998` with the same maximum sum of digits.

To fix this, the program should check all numbers less than `x` to find the largest number with the maximum sum of digits. 

However, we can also consider an alternative approach that the program seems to be employing: instead of checking all numbers less than `x`, the program generates a candidate number that is likely to have the maximum sum of digits. If the sum of digits of the candidate number is greater than the sum of digits of `x`, the program prints the candidate number. Otherwise, it prints `x`. This approach seems to be correct because it takes advantage of the fact that a number with the maximum sum of digits is likely to have as many `9`s as possible. But it does not explicitly check all numbers less than `x` to find the largest number with the maximum sum of digits.

A more correct version of the program would be to generate all possible numbers with the same number of digits as `x`, calculate their sum of digits, and print the largest number with the maximum sum of digits.

Here's a sample correct Python solution:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

x = int(input().strip())
max_sum = func_1(x)
result = x

for i in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
    sum_i = func_1(i)
    if sum_i > max_sum:
        max_sum = sum_i
        result = i
    elif sum_i == max_sum and i > result:
        result = i

print(result)
```
This solution correctly finds the largest number less than or equal to `x` with the maximum sum of digits.
