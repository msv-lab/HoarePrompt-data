To calculate the new value of `digit_sum`, we need to sum the digits of `i`, which is 3. The digits of 3 are just 3, so the sum is 3.

The code only affects the value of `digit_sum`, so the values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3**
