To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `x` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `digit_sum` is 2
- `max_num` is possibly 1 or 2
- `max_sum` is 2

The given code is: 
```
max_num = i
```

This code assigns the value of `i` to `max_num`. Given that `i` is 2, `max_num` will now be 2.

The other variables (`x`, `i`, `digit_sum`, and `max_sum`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `x` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `digit_sum` is 2
- `max_num` is 2 (since `i` is 2)
- `max_sum` is 2

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2, and `max_sum` is 2**
