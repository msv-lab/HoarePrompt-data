The code initializes a new variable `max_num` to 0. The values of `x` and `max_sum` are not changed by the code. `x` remains a positive integer equal to the integer value of `input()`, and `max_sum` remains 0.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer equal to the integer value of `input()`, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0**
