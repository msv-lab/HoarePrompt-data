According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is a positive integer greater than 0, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 to 2 and `x` must be greater than 1 to allow the next iteration.

State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, If `digit_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `digit_sum`, `max_num` is 2, and `digit_sum` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_num` remain unchanged, and the original values of `max_sum` and `max_num` are retained, with `max_num` possibly being 1 or 2**
