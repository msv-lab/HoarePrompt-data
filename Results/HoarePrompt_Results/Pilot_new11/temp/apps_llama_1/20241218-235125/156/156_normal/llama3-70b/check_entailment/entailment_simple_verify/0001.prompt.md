You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Handling of Initial Vertical Movement**: The code correctly handles the initial vertical movement from the top-left to the bottom-left corner of the matrix. For `k < n - 1`, it calculates the current row based on the number of movements made (`k + 1`), considering that the first movement starts from the top-left corner.

2. **Snake Pattern Movement**: After the initial vertical movement, Lara starts moving in a snake pattern. The code uses modular arithmetic to calculate the current position within this pattern. Specifically, it calculates:
   - The column number based on the quotient of `(k - n + 1)` divided by `(n - 1)`, which effectively increments the column after every full cycle through the rows.
   - The row number based on the modulus of `(k - n + 1)` divided by `(n - 1)`, subtracted from `n - 1`, which correctly positions Lara in the snake pattern.

3. **Wrap-around and Final Position**: The use of modular arithmetic (`k %= n * 2 - 2`) ensures that the calculation of the position wraps around correctly for `k` values that exceed a full cycle of movements through the matrix.

4. **Handling of Large Inputs**: The problem statement mentions that `n` and `m` can be up to `10^9` and `k` does not fit into a 32-bit integer type. However, Python can handle arbitrary-precision integers, so it is not a concern for this implementation.

Given the provided examples and the logical breakdown of the program's calculation steps, it appears that the program correctly determines Lara's position after `k` movements in every potential case described by the problem. 

Without finding a specific case where the program fails to adhere to the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers with n being even, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `k % (2*n - 2)` and is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, then two values have been printed: the first is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1`, which cycles through a range determined by `n`, and the second is `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`, which is either 1 or 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, then the values 1 and 2 have been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the remainder of the division of the original `k` by `n * 2 - 2`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then `k + 1` and `1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, then `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1` have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, then `1` and `2` have been printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
