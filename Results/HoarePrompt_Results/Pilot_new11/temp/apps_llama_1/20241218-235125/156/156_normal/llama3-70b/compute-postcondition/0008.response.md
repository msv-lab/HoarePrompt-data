The provided code snippet is a print statement, which does not modify any variables. It simply outputs the values 1 and 2.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is the remainder of the division of the original `k` by `n * 2 - 2`, or `k` is equal to `k % (2*n - 2)`
- `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`
- `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`

Since the print statement does not alter any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the values 1 and 2 have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `k % (2*n - 2)`, `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, and the values 1 and 2 have been printed.**
