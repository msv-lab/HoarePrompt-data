Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is an even positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n*m`. The function prints two values: if `k` is less than `n - 1`, it prints `k + 1` and `1`; otherwise, it calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps` based on `k` and `m`, and then determines a row and column (`row` and `col`) based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. If `full_rows` is even, `row` is `n - full_rows` and `col` is `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, `row` is `n - full_rows` and `col` is `m - remaining_steps`. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `m`, or `k`, and it does not handle any potential edge cases where `n`, `m`, or `k` may not meet the specified conditions. The function only performs printing actions and does not return any values, contrary to the annotations which suggest that it returns `row` and `col`. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that two values have been printed to the console, and the input parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
