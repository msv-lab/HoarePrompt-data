The function accepts three parameters, n, m, and k, from user input, where n and m are expected to be positive integers with n being even, and k is a non-negative integer. The function normalizes k to be within the range 0 to 2n - 3 by taking k modulo (2n - 2). It then prints two values based on the normalized value of k. If k is less than n - 1, it prints k + 1 and 1. If k is greater than or equal to n - 1 and less than n * 2 - 2, it prints two computed values that cycle through a range determined by n. If k is greater than or equal to n * 2 - 2, it prints 1 and 2, although this case is technically impossible due to the initial normalization of k. The function does not return any value, as it's designed to print output directly. After execution, the program state reflects the input values of n, m, and the normalized k, with the printed values being the primary outcome. The function does not explicitly validate the input conditions (n being even, k being within the specified range before normalization), but it will operate based on the provided inputs, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if these conditions are not met.
