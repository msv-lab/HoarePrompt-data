The code `k %= n * 2 - 2` updates the value of `k` by taking the modulus of `k` with `n * 2 - 2`. This means `k` will be assigned the remainder of the division of the original `k` by `n * 2 - 2`. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the remainder of the division of the original `k` by `n * 2 - 2`, which can also be expressed as `k` is equal to `k % (2*n - 2)`**
