Correctness: **True**

The code appears to correctly implement the problem description. It calculates the position of Lara after she moves k times in the given matrix. 

When k is less than n-1, Lara is still moving down the first column, so the code correctly prints k+1 as the row and 1 as the column.

When k is greater than or equal to n-1, Lara starts moving in a snake-like pattern. The code calculates the number of full rows Lara has completed and the remaining steps she needs to take. It then determines the row and column based on whether the number of full rows is even or odd.

The code handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where k is 0 (Lara is at the starting position) or k is equal to n*m-1 (Lara is at the final position). 

For example, when n = 4, m = 3, and k = 0, the code correctly prints 1 1. When n = 4, m = 3, and k = 11, the code correctly prints 1 2. When n = 4, m = 3, and k = 7, the code correctly prints 3 2. 

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases, the correctness is **True**.
