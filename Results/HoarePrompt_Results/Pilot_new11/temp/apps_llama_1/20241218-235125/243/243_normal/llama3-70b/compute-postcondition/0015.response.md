The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial state had `m` as an input integer between 1 and 100,000, `n` as a positive integer. If `n // 5` is less than 100, then `count` is `n // 5` else `count` is 100. 

After the code is executed, `count` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `count` is the old value of `count` plus 1. 

If `n // 5` is less than 100, then the old value of `count` is `n // 5`, so the new value of `count` is `n // 5 + 1`. 

If `n // 5` is not less than 100, then the old value of `count` is 100, so the new value of `count` is 101.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 100,000, `n` is a positive integer. If `n // 5` is less than 100, then `count` is `n // 5 + 1`, else `count` is 101**
