The value of `left` is decreased by 1. Initially, `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1`, so the new value of `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 1 - 1` which simplifies to `(low + high) // 2 - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, and `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 2` with the understanding that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to continue.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` must equal `m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, and `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 2`.**
