The code `left -= 1` decreases the value of `left` by 1.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `left` is `left - 1` such that `func_1(left - 1)` may or may not equal `m`**
