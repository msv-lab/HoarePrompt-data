The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only terminates the loop or switch statement that it is directly inside. The values of `m`, `n`, and `count` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 100,000, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is the previous value of `count` plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
