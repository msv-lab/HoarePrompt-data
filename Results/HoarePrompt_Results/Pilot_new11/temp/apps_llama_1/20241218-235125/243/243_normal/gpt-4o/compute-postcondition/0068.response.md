To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `while func_1(left) == m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the result of `func_1(left)` equals `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`
- `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`
- `result` is an empty list
- `left` is equal to `mid - 1`

Since the loop condition depends solely on `func_1(left)` being equal to `m`, we must adjust the state so that this condition remains true for the next iteration.

However, without knowing the specifics of `func_1`, we cannot directly infer how `left` should be adjusted. The function `func_1` could potentially return `m` for multiple values of `left`, or its behavior might be entirely different based on the context not provided here.

But considering the given state and the fact that `left` is equal to `mid - 1`, for the loop to execute again under the condition `func_1(left) == m`, it must be true that `func_1` of the new `left` value (which could potentially change based on the loop's body, not shown here) must still equal `m`.

Since we do not have information about how `func_1` behaves or how `left` is modified within the loop's body, and given that the task is to modify the state so that the next iteration can proceed under the assumption that the loop condition can certainly be met, we must consider that the condition `func_1(left) == m` needs to be potentially true again.

Thus, without specific details on `func_1` or how variables are modified within the loop, the safest assumption under the given instructions is that we do not need to explicitly adjust `m`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, or `result` directly based on the information provided, but rather ensure that the condition `func_1(left) == m` can potentially hold true for the next iteration.

However, given the strict format and the fact that we cannot make assumptions beyond what is provided, and since the loop's condition is dependent on an external function `func_1` which we have no details about, the focus should be on the condition that needs to be met for the loop to continue, which is `func_1(left) == m`. Without altering the state of variables that directly influence this condition (since we don't know how `func_1` behaves), we acknowledge that for the loop to proceed, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`, but we cannot specify how `left` or other variables must be adjusted without more context.

Given the constraints and focusing strictly on the information provided and the required format:

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid - 1`**
