Correctness: **True**

The code appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given number `n`. The function `func_2` uses `func_1` to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

The binary search approach used in `func_2` is efficient and correctly identifies the range of values for which the factorial has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. The function then expands around the found value to determine the exact range.

The code handles edge cases where no such range exists by returning an empty list. The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code.

For example, when the input is `1`, the code correctly outputs `5` and the numbers `5 6 7 8 9`, which are the numbers whose factorial has exactly `1` trailing zero. When the input is `5`, the code correctly outputs `0`, indicating that there are no numbers whose factorial has exactly `5` trailing zeroes.

Overall, the code is well-structured and correctly implements the required functionality, handling all potential cases as described in the problem description.
