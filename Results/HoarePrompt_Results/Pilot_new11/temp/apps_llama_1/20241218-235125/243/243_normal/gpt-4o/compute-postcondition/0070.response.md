To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition that governs the loop's continuation: `func_1(left) == m`.

Given:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`.
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `left` is equal to `mid - 2`.

The loop condition depends solely on the function `func_1(left)` being equal to `m`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must still be true after the previous iteration. 

However, the provided information does not specify what `func_1(left)` does or how its output is determined. Therefore, we cannot directly infer how the state should be adjusted based on the function's behavior. 

But since the loop's continuation depends on `func_1(left)` returning `m`, for the loop to certainly execute one more time, we must ensure that `left` is such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Given that `left` is `mid - 2`, and without knowing how `func_1` works, we cannot adjust `left` directly based on the provided information. 

The state adjustments are not directly determinable without knowing the specifics of `func_1`. However, following the task's instructions strictly and focusing on the condition that must be met for the loop to continue (and assuming that the loop body does not alter `m` or any other critical variables in a way that would prevent the loop from continuing if `func_1(left)` can still equal `m`), the critical factor is ensuring that `func_1(left)` can indeed equal `m` in the next iteration.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `left` is equal to `mid - 2`, with the understanding that `func_1(left)` must equal `m` for the loop to continue.**
