To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

1. `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
2. `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
3. `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`.
4. `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

The given code is `low = mid + 1`. This means we're updating the value of `low` to be one more than the current `mid`.

Given that `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, after updating `low` to `mid + 1`, the relationship between `low`, `mid`, and `high` will change, but `mid` itself is not updated in the given code snippet. However, logically, if `low` changes, the way we think about `mid` might need to be updated in subsequent calculations because `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`. Yet, in the provided snippet, `mid` itself is not recalculated.

The value of `m` and the relationship that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` are not directly affected by the code `low = mid + 1`, except that now, `low` is explicitly set to be greater than the previous `mid` by 1, potentially altering the balance between `low` and `high` depending on their initial values relative to `mid`.

Given that `zeroes` is the result of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, and there's no indication that `func_1` or its result is affected by the change in `low`, `zeroes` remains as it was before the execution of the given code.

So, after executing `low = mid + 1`, we have:

- `m` remains a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `mid` remains `(low + high) // 2`, but note that this `mid` is based on the old value of `low`, not the updated one.
- `zeroes` remains the return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, based on the original calculation.
- `low` is now `mid + 1`, which means it's greater than the original `mid` by 1.

Thus, the output state, taking into account the updates and the original conditions, is:

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(old_low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1((old_low + high) // 2)`, and `low` is `mid + 1` (where `mid` refers to the original calculation), noting that `low` is now greater than the original `mid` by 1.**
