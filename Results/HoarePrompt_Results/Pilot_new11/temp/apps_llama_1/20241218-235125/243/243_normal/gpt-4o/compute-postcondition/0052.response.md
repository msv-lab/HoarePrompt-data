To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must be true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is unchanged,
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`,
- `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`,
- `low` and `high` are unchanged,
- `result` is an empty list `[]`,
- `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`,
- `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 3`.

The loop condition depends on `func_1(right)` and `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Given that `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 3`, we need to ensure that the value of `func_1(right)` after the last iteration is such that it equals `m` for the loop to proceed.

However, the information provided does not directly state the relationship between `func_1(right)` and `m` after the last iteration, other than stating the condition for `left` and the unchanged state of `m`. The critical piece of information is that `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 3`, and we are considering the condition `func_1(right) == m` for the next iteration.

Since `right` is calculated based on `low` and `high`, and both `low` and `high` are unchanged, for the loop to execute again, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. There is no direct adjustment needed to the states of `m`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, `result`, or `left` based on the information given, as the loop's continuation is contingent upon the relationship between `func_1(right)` and `m`, not their individual values.

Thus, the adjustment needed is conceptual, ensuring that the condition `func_1(right) == m` is met, which implies that the function `func_1` at the value of `right` (which is `(low + high) // 2 + 3`) must return `m` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `zeroes` is the original return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `(low + high) // 2 + 3` and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`**
