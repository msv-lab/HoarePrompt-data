According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and the function `func_1(right)`. If `func_1(right)` equals `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `right` is `mid + 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is the integer part of `(low + high) / 2`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is the first value less than or equal to `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `mid + 1` and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`**
