#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is an integer m, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000, representing the required number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a positive integer n.
def func():
    m = int(input())
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count >= m:
            break
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` will be incremented indefinitely because `n` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1, but in practical terms regarding the calculation of trailing zeroes, this loop does not behave as intended due to `n` being constant at 1. For any meaningful calculation, `n` would need to be adjustable or relevant to the division operation in a way that `n = 1` is not.
    n = 1
    ans = []
    while True:
        if n // 5 ** count < m:
            break
        
        ans.append(n)
        
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the smallest integer such that `n // 5
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the number of positive integers `n` such that the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` is at least `m`, where `m` is a user-provided integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), and also prints the sequence of these integers. The function essentially finds the smallest range of integers `n` for which the condition on trailing zeroes in their factorials is met, starting from `n = 1`, and continues until it finds `m` or more trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`. The function's output includes the count of such integers and the integers themselves. However, the code contains a logical flaw due to the constant value of `n` in the initial loop, which does not affect the calculation of trailing zeroes directly but affects the loop's termination condition. Despite this, the overall purpose of the function is to identify and print the sequence of integers `n` that satisfy the given condition regarding the trailing zeroes in their factorials. The function's actual output may not perfectly align with its intended purpose due to the mentioned flaw but aims to provide a sequence of integers that meet a specific criterion related to trailing zeroes in their factorials.
