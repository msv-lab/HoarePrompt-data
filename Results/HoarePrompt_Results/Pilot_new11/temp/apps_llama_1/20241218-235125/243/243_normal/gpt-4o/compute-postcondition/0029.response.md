The value of `result` is reassigned to be a list of values in the range from `left + 1` to `right - 1` (since the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value). The values of the other variables are not affected, so they remain the same. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the smallest value greater than `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is the smallest value greater than `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`**
