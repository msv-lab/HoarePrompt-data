Postcondition: ***`m` is an input integer between 1 and 100,000, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is 0. If `n` divided by 5 to the power of `count` is greater than or equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the if statement does nothing as there is no else part.***
