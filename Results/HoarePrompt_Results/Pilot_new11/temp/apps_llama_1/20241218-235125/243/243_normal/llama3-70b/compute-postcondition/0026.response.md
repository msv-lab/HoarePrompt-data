The code is a `break` statement, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement we are directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`n` is 2, `count` is a finite value, `m` is greater than 1, `ans` is [1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
