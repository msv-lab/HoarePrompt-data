You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count

#Function 2:
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (factorial of `n`), and `func_2` uses `func_1` to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

`func_1` works by counting the number of factors of 5 in `n!`, since a trailing zero is created by a factor of 2 and a factor of 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5. It does this by dividing `n` by increasing powers of 5 and summing up the results.

`func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the range of numbers `n` that satisfy the condition. It starts by initializing a range `[low, high]` and then performs a binary search to find a number `mid` such that `mid!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. Once it finds such a number, it expands around it to find all numbers in the range that satisfy the condition.

The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `m` is 0, the program will return an empty list, which is correct since `0!` has no trailing zeroes. If `m` is a large number, the program will return an empty list, which is also correct since there is a limit to the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

The program also handles the case where there are multiple numbers `n` that satisfy the condition. For example, if `m` is 1, the program will return the list `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, which is correct since `5!`, `6!`, `7!`, `8!`, and `9!` all have exactly one trailing zero.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and handles all potential cases. It correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` and finds all numbers `n` that satisfy the condition.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function func_2 accepts a single parameter, a positive integer m between 1 and 100,000, and returns a list of integers. The returned list represents the range of values for which the function func_1 returns exactly m trailing zeroes when calculating the factorial of a number. If no such range exists, the function returns an empty list. The function iteratively searches for the range of values that satisfy this condition using a binary search approach and then expands around the found value to determine the exact range. After execution, the function's state is reset, with the only lasting result being the returned list of integers or an empty list if no matching range is found. The function does not modify the input parameter m and does not have any side effects. The returned list includes all integers from the first value greater than the lower boundary (for which func_1 does not return m) plus one, to the last value less than the upper boundary (for which func_1 does not return m) minus one. The function handles edge cases where no such range exists by returning an empty list.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
