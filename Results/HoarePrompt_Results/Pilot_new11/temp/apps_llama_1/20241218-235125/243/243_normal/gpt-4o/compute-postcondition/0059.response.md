According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is less than or equal to `high`. However, the loop body updates these variables in a way that `low` can become greater than `high` under certain conditions. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` (the return value of `func_1((low + high) // 2)`) is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, which could potentially make `low` greater than `high` if `mid` is close to `high`. If `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, the update rules for `low` and `high` are such that `low` could become greater than `high` if `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `mid` is close to `low`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, it must be the case that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` was less than `m`, then after updating `low` to `mid + 1`, `low` must still be less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` was greater than or equal to `m`, then either the updates to `low` and `high` did not occur, or if they did, `low` must still be less than or equal to `high` after the update.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
