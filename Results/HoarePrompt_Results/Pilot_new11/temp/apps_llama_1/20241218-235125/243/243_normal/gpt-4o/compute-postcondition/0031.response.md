Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, then `low` is `0` and `high` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`, and `result` is an empty list. Otherwise, `low` is `0`, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `right` is the smallest value greater than `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
