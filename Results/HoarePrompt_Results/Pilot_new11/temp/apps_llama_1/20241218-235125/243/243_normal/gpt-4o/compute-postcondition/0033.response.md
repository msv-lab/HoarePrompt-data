To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we should analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `low <= high`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`.
- `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`.
- `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)`.

The adjustments depend on the value of `zeroes` relative to `m`. 

1. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, then `low` is updated to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)`, with `result` being an empty list. In this case, for the loop to execute again, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, which means `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1` must be less than or equal to `5 * (m + 1)`. This condition is always true given the definition of `mid` and the update of `low`, so no additional adjustments are needed based on this condition alone.

2. If `zeroes` is greater than or equal to `m`, then either `low` remains `0` and `high` is updated to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1` if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, or `low` remains `0`, `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)`, and `result` becomes a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `zeroes` equals `m`. For the loop to execute again when `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, meaning `0` must be less than or equal to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `0 <= (5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`. Given that `m` is a positive integer, this condition will always be true because `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2` will always be greater than `1` for any positive `m`, thus ensuring that `high` can be updated to a value that is at least `0` after subtracting `1`.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time after the previous iteration, we need `low` to be less than or equal to `high`. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` is updated to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1`, and `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, which inherently satisfies `low <= high` because `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 + 1` is less than `5 * (m + 1)` for all positive `m`. 

For the case where `zeroes` is greater than `m`, and `high` is updated to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1`, to ensure `low <= high`, we must consider the initial condition that allows `low` to be `0` and `high` to be updated in such a way that the loop can still execute. This implies `0` (the value of `low`) must be less than or equal to `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2 - 1` (the updated value of `high`), which is automatically satisfied because `m` is positive and `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2` will be greater than `1`.

Given these considerations, for the loop to execute one more time, the key is ensuring that `low` is less than or equal to `high` after the updates based on the value of `zeroes`. Since `low` and `high` are adjusted based on `zeroes` and `m`, and considering `m`'s definition and `mid`'s calculation, we focus on the relationship between `low`, `high`, and the conditions that adjust them.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100,000`, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, and `zeroes` is the return value of `func_1(mid)` such that after updates, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
