Postcondition: ***`m` is an input integer between 1 and 100,000, `n` is a positive integer. If `n // 5 ** count` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `count` is the previous value of `count` plus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, as there is no else part to handle this condition.***
