The code snippet is a break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. This statement does not change the values of any variables. 

Given the initial state:
- `m` is unchanged
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`
- `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`
- `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`
- `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`
- `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`
- `right` is the smallest value greater than `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `right` is the smallest value greater than `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 1` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
