The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 3` and `func_1(right - 1)` must equal `m`.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `low` is 0, `high` is `5 * (m + 1)`, `result` is an empty list, `mid` is `(5 * (m + 1)) // 2`, `zeroes` equals the original value of `m`, `left` is the first value less than the original `left` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` is `((5 * (m + 1)) // 2) + 3`**
