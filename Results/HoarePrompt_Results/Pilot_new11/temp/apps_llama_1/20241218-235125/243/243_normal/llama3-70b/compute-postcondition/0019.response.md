According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will execute indefinitely as long as the program doesn't encounter a break statement or an error. Since the condition is always `True`, no adjustments to the states are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is 1, `count` will be incremented indefinitely if a loop is present, `m` is greater than 1, `ans` is an empty list**
