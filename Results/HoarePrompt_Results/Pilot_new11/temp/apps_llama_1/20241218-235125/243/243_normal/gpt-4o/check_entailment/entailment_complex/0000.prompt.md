You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Annotated Functions:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `power_of_5` is the smallest power of 5 greater than `n`, `count` equals the original value of `trailing_zeroes` which is the sum of `n` divided by all powers of 5 until the quotient is less than 1, and this sum also represents the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of the original value of `n`.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of the original value of `n`, which is equal to the sum of `n` divided by all powers of 5 until the quotient is less than 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer, and returns the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`, calculated as the sum of `n` divided by all powers of 5 until the quotient is less than 1. The function handles all positive integer inputs, and the returned value represents the count of factors of 5 in all the numbers from 1 to `n`, which in turn determines the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`. The function does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that `n` will always be a positive integer. If `n` were to be 0 or a negative integer, the function would still return a value, but this would not accurately reflect the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`, as the factorial is only defined for non-negative integers and the function does not handle these edge cases. For any positive integer `n`, the function will return the correct count of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, or `low` and `high` are unchanged if `func_1(mid)` equals `m` and the loop breaks, `m` is unchanged, and `result` is either an empty list if no `mid` satisfies `func_1(mid) == m`, or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` where `left` and `right` are the boundaries for which `func_1(x)` equals `m`, with `left` being the first value less than `mid` for which `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, and `right` being the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`.
    return result
    #The program returns 'result' which is either an empty list if no 'mid' satisfies 'func_1(mid) == m', or a list of integers from 'left + 1' to 'right - 1' where 'left' and 'right' are the boundaries for which 'func_1(x)' equals 'm', with 'left' being the first value less than 'mid' for which 'func_1(left)' does not equal 'm', and 'right' being the first value greater than 'mid' for which 'func_1(right)' does not equal 'm'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts a single parameter, a positive integer m between 1 and 100,000, and returns a list of integers. The returned list represents the range of values for which the function func_1 returns exactly m trailing zeroes when calculating the factorial of a number. If no such range exists, the function returns an empty list. The function iteratively searches for the range of values that satisfy this condition using a binary search approach and then expands around the found value to determine the exact range. After execution, the function's state is reset, with the only lasting result being the returned list of integers or an empty list if no matching range is found. The function does not modify the input parameter m and does not have any side effects. The returned list includes all integers from the first value greater than the lower boundary (for which func_1 does not return m) plus one, to the last value less than the upper boundary (for which func_1 does not return m) minus one. The function handles edge cases where no such range exists by returning an empty list.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
