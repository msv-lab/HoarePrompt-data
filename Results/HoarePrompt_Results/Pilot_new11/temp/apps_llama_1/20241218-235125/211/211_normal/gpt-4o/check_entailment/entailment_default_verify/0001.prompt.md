You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. For example, the program does not handle the case when the input array has multiple non-zero elements that can be grouped together to form subarrays with non-zero sums.

One example of this is when the input array is `[1, -2, 1, -1]`. In this case, the program should group the first two elements (`1` and `-2`) together and the last two elements (`1` and `-1`) together, resulting in two subarrays with non-zero sums: `[1, -2]` and `[1, -1]`. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and prints `NO`.

The problem in the program lies in its logic of handling cases when the total sum of the array is not zero. It simply prints `YES` and tries to split the array into two parts, but it does not consider all possible ways of grouping the elements together to form subarrays with non-zero sums.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible ways of grouping the elements together and find the correct way to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums. The program should also handle cases when there are multiple ways to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums, and it should print any one of these correct solutions.

Here's a revised version of the program that should handle all potential cases correctly:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    result = []
    current_sum = 0
    start = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current_sum += A[i]
        if current_sum!= 0:
            if i == n - 1 or current_sum - A[i + 1]!= 0:
                result.append((start + 1, i + 1))
                start = i + 1
                current_sum = 0
    print('YES')
    print(len(result))
    for start, end in result:
        print(start, end)

func()
```

This revised program first checks if the total sum of the array is zero. If it is, the program prints `NO` because it's not possible to split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums.

If the total sum of the array is not zero, the program tries to group the elements together to form subarrays with non-zero sums. It keeps track of the current sum of the elements in the current subarray and the start index of the current subarray.

When the current sum is not zero, the program checks if it has reached the end of the array or if the current sum minus the next element is not zero. If either condition is true, it means that the current subarray has a non-zero sum, so the program adds the current subarray to the result and resets the current sum and start index.

Finally, the program prints `YES` and the number of subarrays, followed by the start and end indices of each subarray.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes a list of integers as input where the first element represents the number of elements in the array, reads the input from the user, and processes the array to check if its elements sum up to zero or not. If the sum is not zero, it prints 'YES', '1', and the range '1' to 'n' (the length of the array). If the sum is zero, it iterates through the array to find the first non-zero element, prints 'YES', '2', the range '1' to the index of the non-zero element, and the range from the index after the non-zero element to 'n'. If all elements are zero, it does not print any additional output beyond the initial 'YES' and '2' for the case when a non-zero element is found, implying that no suitable range is found to print. The function modifies the state of the program by printing these outputs based on the input array's properties, but it does not return any value. It only prints the results based on the sum and elements of the array A.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
