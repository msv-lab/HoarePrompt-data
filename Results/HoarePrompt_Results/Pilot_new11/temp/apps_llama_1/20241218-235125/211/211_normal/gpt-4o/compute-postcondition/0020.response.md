The code prints the values of `i + 2` and `n`. The initial state provides the values of `i` as 1 and `n` as an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), with `n` being at least 2.

So, `i + 2` equals 3.

The code does not change the values of `A`, `total_sum`, `i`, or `n`, but it prints the value of `i + 2` (which is 3) and the value of `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '2' has been printed again, and '3' and the value of `n` have been printed.
Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '2' has been printed again, '3' has been printed, and the value of `n` has been printed.**
