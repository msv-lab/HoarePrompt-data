The value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to be the sum of `prefix_sum[i]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` becomes `prefix_sum[0] + a[0]`. Since `prefix_sum` is initially a list of `n + 1` zeros, `prefix_sum[0]` is 0. Therefore, `prefix_sum[1]` is equal to `a[0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `A` is still a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is still a list of `n` integers, `n` is still greater than 0, and `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0 and `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `i` is 0**
