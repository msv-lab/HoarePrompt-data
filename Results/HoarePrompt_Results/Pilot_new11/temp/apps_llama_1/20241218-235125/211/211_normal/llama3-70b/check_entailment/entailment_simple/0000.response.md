Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it does not correctly split the array into subarrays where the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero.

The issue is in the line where the program prints the subarrays:

```python
print(k, l, r)
```

According to the problem description, the output should be in the format of `l_i` and `r_i` (the start and end indices of each subarray), but the program prints `k`, `l`, and `r`, where `k` is the number of subarrays found so far, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the current subarray.

Moreover, the last print statement is also incorrect:

```python
print(k, l, n)
```

This will print the total number of subarrays found, and the start index of the last subarray, and the end index of the entire array. However, the correct output should be the start and end indices of the last subarray.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input array cannot be split into subarrays where the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero, correctly. If the total sum of the array is zero, the program should print "NO". However, if the array can be split into subarrays where the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero, but the program does not find such a split, it will still print "YES" and incorrect output.

A correct implementation would involve finding the correct subarrays, and then printing their start and end indices in the correct format. 

Here is an example of how the correct implementation could look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]

    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        subarrays = []
        l = 0
        for r in range(1, n + 1):
            if prefix_sum[r]!= 0 and prefix_sum[r]!= prefix_sum[n]:
                subarrays.append((l + 1, r))
                l = r
        subarrays.append((l + 1, n))
        print(len(subarrays))
        for subarray in subarrays:
            print(subarray[0], subarray[1])
```
This implementation correctly splits the array into subarrays where the sum of elements in each subarray is not zero, and prints the start and end indices of each subarray in the correct format.
