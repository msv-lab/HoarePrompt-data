Postcondition: ***`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. If `A[i]` is not equal to 0, then 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '2' has been printed again, '3' has been printed, the value of `n` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
