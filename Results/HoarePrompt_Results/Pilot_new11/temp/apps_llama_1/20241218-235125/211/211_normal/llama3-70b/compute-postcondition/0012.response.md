Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, and `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, or `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros and `i` is undefined if `n` is 0, and the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, i.e., `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0**
