Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases of array splitting as specified in the problem description. 

One example where the program does not work as expected is when the input array has multiple non-zero elements and the sum of the array is not zero, but the sum of some of its prefixes is. For instance, if we have the array [1, -1, 1, -1, 1], the program will not correctly split this array into non-zero sum subarrays.

In the given code, it checks if the total sum of the array is not zero and prints the entire array as one subarray. However, this approach does not consider the case where the array can be split into multiple subarrays with non-zero sums. 

Another issue with the code is that it only checks if the current element is non-zero and splits the array at that point. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting subarrays will have non-zero sums.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible splits of the array and checking if each subarray has a non-zero sum. If such a split is found, the program should print "YES" along with the number of subarrays and their respective start and end indices. If no such split is found, the program should print "NO". 

Here's an example of how the correct program could look:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        for i in range(1 << (k - 1)):
            splits = [0]
            for j in range(k - 1):
                if (i >> j) & 1:
                    splits.append(j + 1)
            splits.append(n)
            
            valid_split = True
            for j in range(k):
                subarray_sum = sum(A[splits[j]:splits[j + 1]])
                if subarray_sum == 0:
                    valid_split = False
                    break
            
            if valid_split:
                print('YES')
                print(k)
                for j in range(k):
                    print(splits[j] + 1, splits[j + 1])
                return
    
    print('NO')
