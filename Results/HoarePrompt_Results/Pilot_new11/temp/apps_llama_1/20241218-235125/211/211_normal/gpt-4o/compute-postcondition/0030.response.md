To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and code step by step.

1. **Initial State**: The list `A` has at least one element, where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and the rest of the elements in `A` are within the range `-10^3 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^3`. The `total_sum` of all elements in `A` is `0`.

2. **Loop Code**:
    ```
    for i in range(n):
        if A[i]!= 0:
            print('YES')
            print('2')
            print('1', i + 1)
            print(i + 2, n)
            break
    else:
        print('NO')
    ```
    
3. **Understanding the Loop**:
    - The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the first element of the list `A`.
    - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `A[i]` is not equal to `0`. If this condition is true, it prints specific messages and breaks out of the loop.
    - If the loop completes all iterations without finding any non-zero element (i.e., all elements in the considered range are `0`), it prints 'NO'.

4. **Output State Analysis**:
    - **After the loop executes**: If any `A[i]` is not `0` during the iterations, the loop breaks after printing the specified messages. This implies that `i` will be the index of the first non-zero element found in the list `A` (considering the range from `A[0]` to `A[n-1]`).
    - If all elements in the range `A[0]` to `A[n-1]` are `0`, the loop completes all `n` iterations without breaking, and 'NO' is printed. In this case, `i` will have iterated through all indices from `0` to `n-1`.
    - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the loop counter's upper limit. `total_sum` is given as `0` initially and does not change within the loop.

Given these observations, the output state after all iterations can be summarized as follows:

- **If a non-zero element is found**:
    - The loop breaks at the index `i` where the first non-zero `A[i]` is encountered.
    - 'YES', '2', '1' followed by the index `i+1`, and `i+2` followed by `n` are printed to the console.
- **If no non-zero element is found**:
    - The loop iterates `n` times without breaking.
    - 'NO' is printed to the console after the loop completes.
- `n` remains the same, as it is the first element of `A`.
- `total_sum` remains `0`, as it is not modified within the loop.

**Output State:** **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `n` is unchanged, and either 'YES' with specific indices is printed if a non-zero element is found in `A` within the range, or 'NO' is printed if all elements in the considered range are 0.**
