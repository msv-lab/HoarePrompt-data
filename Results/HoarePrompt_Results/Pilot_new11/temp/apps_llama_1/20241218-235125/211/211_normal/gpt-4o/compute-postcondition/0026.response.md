The code prints '1' and the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` equals 3. The states of the variables `A`, `n`, and `total_sum` are not affected. 
The values of `A[0]`, `total_sum`, and `n` remain the same: `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `total_sum` is 0, and `n` is at least 3. The elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) still sum up to `-A[0]`. 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, and now '1' and '3' have also been printed.
Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, and '3' has been printed**
