The given code prints the value of `i + 2` and `n` to the console. The initial state provides that `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. 

The values of `i + 2` and `n` are printed, which results in `2` and the value of `n` being printed to the console, respectively.

The states of the other variables and conditions are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed to the console, '2' has been printed to the console, '1' and 1 have been printed to the console, and `i + 2` (which is 2) and the value of `n` have been printed to the console.

Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed to the console, '2' has been printed to the console, '1' and 1 have been printed to the console, and 2 and `n` have been printed to the console.**
