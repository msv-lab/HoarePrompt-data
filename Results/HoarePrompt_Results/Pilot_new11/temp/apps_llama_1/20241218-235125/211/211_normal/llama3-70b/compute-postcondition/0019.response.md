The value of `k` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `k` is `1 + 1 = 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of all elements in `a` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `2`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, and the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` have been printed as `1 1 1`.
