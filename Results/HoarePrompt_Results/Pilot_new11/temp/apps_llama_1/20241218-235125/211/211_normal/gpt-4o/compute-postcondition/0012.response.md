The code prints '1' and the value of `i + 1` to the console. The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. '1' and 1 have been printed to the console, in addition to the previous 'YES' and '2'. 

Output State: **`A` is a list where `A[0]` is an integer `n` with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the elements in `A` (excluding `A[0]`) sum up to `-A[0]`, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, 'YES' has been printed to the console, '2' has been printed to the console, and '1' and 1 have been printed to the console.**
