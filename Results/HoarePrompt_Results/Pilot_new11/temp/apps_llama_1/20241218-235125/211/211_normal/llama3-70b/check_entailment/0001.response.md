Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the output format as specified in the problem description. In the case where a subarray with a non-zero sum is found, the program prints three values (k, l, r) on the same line, but it should only print two values (l, r) on each line after printing the number of subarrays (k).

Another issue is that the program does not correctly calculate the number of subarrays (k). It increments k every time it finds a subarray with a non-zero sum, but it should only increment k when it finds a new subarray that does not overlap with the previous one.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input array has multiple subarrays with non-zero sums correctly. It only prints the first subarray and then tries to print the remaining elements as a single subarray, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1 2 3 -6
```
The program will output:
```
YES
2 1 3
3 1 4
```
Which is incorrect. The correct output should be:
```
YES
1
1 4
```
