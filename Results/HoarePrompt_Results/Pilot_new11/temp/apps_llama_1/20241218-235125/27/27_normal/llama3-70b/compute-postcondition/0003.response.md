The value of `a3` is assigned the result of `(x ** y) ** z`. According to the order of operations, this expression is equivalent to `x ** (y * z)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive real number input by the user, `y` is a positive real number input by the user, `z` is a positive real number input by the user, `a1` is equal to `x`, `a2` is equal to `x`, and `a3` is equal to `x ** (y * z)`.

Output State: **`x` is a positive real number input by the user, `y` is a positive real number input by the user, `z` is a positive real number input by the user, `a1` is equal to `x`, `a2` is equal to `x`, and `a3` is equal to `x ** (y * z)`**
