Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program calculates the maximum value among the 12 given expressions and prints the corresponding expression. The program correctly handles the input of three real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point and calculates the values of the 12 expressions. It then finds the maximum value and prints the corresponding expression.

The program uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum value in the list `a`, and the `index` method to find the index of the maximum value. This index is then used to print the corresponding expression from the list `b`.

The program handles all possible cases, including when the maximum value occurs multiple times, in which case it prints the first occurrence. The program also correctly handles the formatting of the output, printing the expressions without brackets when possible and with brackets when necessary.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, I did not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The code correctly implements the required functionality and handles all possible cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
