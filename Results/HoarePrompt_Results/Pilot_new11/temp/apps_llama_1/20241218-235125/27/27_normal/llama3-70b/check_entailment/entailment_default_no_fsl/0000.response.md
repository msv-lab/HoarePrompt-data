Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the problem description, calculating twelve different exponential expressions using the input numbers x, y, and z, and printing the string representation of the expression that yields the maximum value. The code correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description and follows the specified output format.

Assuming valid input, the code accurately computes and compares the values of the twelve exponential expressions and selects the correct expression to print. The use of the `index` method to find the index of the maximum value in the list `a` and the corresponding expression in the list `b` ensures that the correct expression is printed.

The code does not need to handle invalid input, such as non-numeric input or input values outside the specified range, as it is assumed that the input will be valid. Therefore, the code is correct and works as expected for every potential case, given the assumptions in the problem description.
