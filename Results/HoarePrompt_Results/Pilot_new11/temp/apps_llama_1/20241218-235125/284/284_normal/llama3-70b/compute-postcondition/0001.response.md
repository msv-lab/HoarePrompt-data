Given the initial state that `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 1000, and the current value of `num` is less than 2, we can deduce that `num` must be 1 because it's the only integer that satisfies both conditions.

The code simply returns `False`, which does not depend on the value of `num`. 

Output State: **The program returns False**
