The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 1000. After executing the function body, there are multiple possible return values based on certain conditions. However, the specific conditions for each case are not fully detailed except for Case_7, which returns True if `x` is a prime number not divisible by 2, 3, or any prime number less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and there exists an integer `i` of the form `5 + 6k` greater than the square root of `x`. Since the conditions for the other cases are not provided, we can only describe the functionality based on the information given for Case_7.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `x` within the range 1 to 1000 and returns True if `x` is a prime number with specific divisibility conditions and False otherwise.**
