Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It finds a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis that for any positive integer `n`, there exists a positive integer `m` such that `n·m + 1` is a prime number.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
2. For each `m`, it checks whether `n·m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function.
3. The `func_1` function correctly checks whether a given number `x` is prime or not. It handles all cases, including when `x` is less than or equal to 1, when `x` is less than or equal to 3, and when `x` is divisible by 2 or 3. For larger values of `x`, it iteratively checks divisibility by numbers of the form `5 + 6k`, where `k` is an integer, up to the square root of `x`.
4. If `func_1` returns `False` for a given `m`, the program immediately prints the value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The program is correct because it will always find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. According to the problem description, it is guaranteed that such a counterexample exists. The program's use of a brute-force approach to iterate over all possible values of `m` ensures that it will eventually find a counterexample.

In particular, the program will work correctly for all possible inputs `n` between 1 and 1000, and it will always output a value of `m` such that `n·m + 1` is not a prime number. The program's correctness is not dependent on any specific properties of the input `n`, and it will work correctly for all possible inputs.
