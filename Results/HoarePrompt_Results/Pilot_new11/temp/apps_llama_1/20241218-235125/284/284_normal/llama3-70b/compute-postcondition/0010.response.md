To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `num` is an integer such that 9 < `num` <= 1000.
- `i` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration.
- The loop iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive), meaning `i` takes values starting from 2 up to the integer part of the square root of `num`, plus 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next integer value within the defined range. Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 4.

Moreover, for the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 4) must be less than or equal to the square root of `num`. This implies that the square root of `num` must be greater than 4, because if it were exactly 4, and considering the loop's upper limit includes the integer part of the square root of `num` plus 1, `i` could still be 4 but `num` must support `i` being potentially one more than 4 for the loop to continue beyond `i = 4`. Thus, the square root of `num` must be greater than 4, meaning `num` must be greater than 16.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `num` must be an integer greater than 16 and less than or equal to 1000, because the loop's condition depends on `i` being less than or equal to the square root of `num`, and `i` is now 4.
- `i` is 4, because it increments by 1 from its previous value of 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is adjusted as follows:

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 16 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 4**.
