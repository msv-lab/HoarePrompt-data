Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error. The function `func_1` is being called before it's defined. In Python, the code is executed line by line, so when the `for` loop tries to call `func_1`, it hasn't been defined yet, resulting in a `NameError`. 

To fix this issue, the function definition should be moved above the loop where it's being called. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break
```

This corrected code will work as expected and find a counterexample for any given `n`.
