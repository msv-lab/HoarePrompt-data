    return True
    #The program returns True, where `i` is the smallest value greater than the square root of the original `x` such that `i` is of the form `5 + 6k` (where `k` is an integer), and `x` is a prime number not divisible by 2, 3, or any prime number less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `x` within the range 1 to 1000 and checks whether it is a prime number, returning `True` if `x` is prime and `False` otherwise. The function handles various cases, including when `x` is less than or equal to 1, when `x` is less than or equal to 3, and when `x` is divisible by 2 or 3. For larger values of `x`, the function iteratively checks divisibility by numbers of the form `5 + 6k`, where `k` is an integer, up to the square root of `x`. If `x` is divisible by any of these numbers or their increments by 2, the function returns `False`. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that `x` is a prime number not divisible by 2, 3, or any prime number less than or equal to the square root of `x`. The final state of the program after execution includes the returned boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on the primality of `x`, with no modifications to the input parameter `x`.
