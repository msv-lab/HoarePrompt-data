You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".

Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.


-----Input-----

The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis. 


-----Output-----

Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.


-----Examples-----
Input
3

Output
1
Input
4

Output
2


-----Note-----

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.

In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break

def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error. The function `func_1` is being called before it's defined. In Python, the code is executed line by line, so when the `for` loop tries to call `func_1`, it hasn't been defined yet, resulting in a `NameError`. 

To fix this issue, the function definition should be moved above the loop where it's being called. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break
```

This corrected code will work as expected and find a counterexample for any given `n`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if a given integer `num` is a prime number and returns `True` if it is, `False` otherwise. It accepts an integer parameter `num` where `1 <= num <= 1000`. The function returns `False` for inputs less than 2, and for composite numbers (i.e., numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves). If `num` is a prime number greater than or equal to 2, the function returns `True`. The function handles all potential cases, including edge cases such as the smallest prime number (2) and the largest possible input (1000). Note that the function does not modify the input `num` and only returns a boolean value indicating whether `num` is prime or not.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
