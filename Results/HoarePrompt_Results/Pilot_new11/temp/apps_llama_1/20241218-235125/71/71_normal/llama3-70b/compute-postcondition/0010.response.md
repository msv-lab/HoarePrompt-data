The given code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. 

Given that `n` is the input integer with its last two digits removed and does not become divisible by 10, and `w` is increased by 1, we first need to understand that `n` has been modified before this step to remove its last two digits. However, this step further modifies `n` by removing one more digit (the last one remaining after the initial modification).

The value of `n` before this operation can be considered as a number that does not end in 0 (since removing its last two digits did not make it divisible by 10). After `n //= 10`, `n` will be an integer where its last digit has been removed. 

The condition that `n` does not become divisible by 10 after its last two digits were removed still holds, as this operation further reduces `n` but does not alter its divisibility by 10 based on the previous condition. 

The variable `w` is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, considering all these points, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer with its last three digits removed and does not become divisible by 10, `w` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer with its last three digits removed and does not become divisible by 10, `w` is increased by 1**
