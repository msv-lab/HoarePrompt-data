Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The program attempts to remove digits from the right side of the number by continuously dividing `n` by 10 until it is divisible by 10 to the power of `k`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider all possible combinations of digits that can be removed to make the number divisible by 10 to the power of `k`.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible substrings of the input number and checking if removing the corresponding digits would result in a number that is divisible by 10 to the power of `k`. The minimum number of digits that need to be removed to achieve this should be returned.

For example, consider the input `10203049 2`. The provided program would incorrectly return `7` because it would continuously divide the number by 10 from the right until it is divisible by 10 squared. However, the correct answer is `3` because removing the digits `2`, `3`, and `4` would result in the number `100049`, which is not divisible by 10 squared, but removing the digits `2`, `0`, and `3` would result in `10049`, which is still not divisible by 10 squared. However, removing the digits `1`, `0`, and `2` would result in `303049`, which is still not divisible by 10 squared, but removing the digits `1`, `0`, and `3` would result in `20049`, which is not divisible by 10 squared, but removing the digits `1`, `0`, and `4` would result in `20309`, which is not divisible by 10 squared, but removing the digits `1`, `2`, and `3` would result in `00049`, which is divisible by 10 squared.

A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum number of digits that need to be removed to make the number divisible by 10 to the power of `k` for each prefix of the input number.

Here is a simple example of how the function could be implemented in Python:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    n_str = str(n)
    min_removed = float('inf')
    for mask in range(1 << len(n_str)):
        removed = bin(mask).count('1')
        new_n_str = ''.join([n_str[i] for i in range(len(n_str)) if (mask & (1 << i)) == 0])
        if new_n_str and int(new_n_str) % (10 ** k) == 0:
            min_removed = min(min_removed, removed)
    print(min_removed)
```

This code generates all possible masks for the digits of the input number, removes the digits corresponding to each mask, and checks if the resulting number is divisible by 10 to the power of `k`. The minimum number of digits that need to be removed to achieve this is returned.
