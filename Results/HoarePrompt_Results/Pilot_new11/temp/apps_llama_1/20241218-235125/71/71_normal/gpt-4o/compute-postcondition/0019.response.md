To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the conditions at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop: `for digit in reversed(n):`

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character.
- `k` is an integer.
- The conditions regarding `count_zeros` and `to_remove` depend on the current digit being processed and the second-to-last character of `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. **`n` must have at least one more character**: Since the loop iterates over `n` in reverse, removing the last character (which was the current `digit` in the previous iteration) still leaves `n` with at least one character, adhering to the condition that `n` is non-empty.

2. **Conditions for `count_zeros` and `to_remove`**: These depend on the digit that was just processed and the new last character of `n` (since we're moving one character backwards in `n`). 
    - If the digit that was just processed is '0', then in the previous iteration, `count_zeros` was 2 and `to_remove` was 0. Now, moving to the next iteration, we consider the new last character of `n` (which becomes the current `digit`).
        - If this new digit is '0', then `count_zeros` becomes 1 (because we've moved past one '0'), and `to_remove` becomes 1.
        - If this new digit is not '0', then `count_zeros` becomes 0, and `to_remove` becomes 2.
    - If the digit that was just processed is not '0', then the previous iteration's `count_zeros` and `to_remove` values were determined by the second-to-last character of `n` (now the last character since we've moved one step back).
        - If this character is '0', then `count_zeros` was 1 and `to_remove` was 1. Moving forward, if the new current character (digit) is '0', `count_zeros` becomes 2, and `to_remove` becomes 0. If the new digit is not '0', `count_zeros` and `to_remove` are determined by the character before this new digit (the new second-to-last character), following the same logic as before.
        - If the second-to-last character is not '0', then `count_zeros` was 0, and `to_remove` was 2. The logic for updating these variables in the next iteration depends on the new digit and the character before it, using the same rules.

However, the description provided doesn't directly tie the values of `count_zeros` and `to_remove` to the loop condition directly in a simple manner but rather implies their values are contingent on the digit being processed and the state of `n`. 

Given the previous iteration's state and the need for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the critical factor: `n` must have at least one more character for the loop to continue, as the loop iterates over each character in `n` in reverse.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` remains an integer, `count_zeros` and `to_remove` are updated based on the next digit in reverse order of `n`**
