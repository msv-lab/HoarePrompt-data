Postcondition: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `k` remains an integer. If the current digit is '0', `count_zeros` is increased by 1 and `to_remove` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is updated based on the next digit in reverse order of `n` and `to_remove` is incremented by 1.**
