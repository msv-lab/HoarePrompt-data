You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. 

One potential issue with this program is that it doesn't correctly handle cases where the number of zeros at the end of the number is less than k. In such cases, the program should try to remove as few digits as possible to get a number that is divisible by 10^k.

For example, consider the input "1234567 3". The program will output "6", but the correct answer is "6" because we need to remove at least 6 digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^3. However, the program doesn't consider the optimal removal of digits in such cases.

Another issue with the program is that it doesn't handle cases where the number starts with zeros correctly. Although the program doesn't need to handle such cases because the input is guaranteed to be without extra leading zeros, it's still worth noting that the program may not work correctly if the input can have leading zeros.

To correctly solve this problem, a more complex algorithm is needed that tries all possible removals of digits and checks if the resulting number is divisible by 10^k. The program should also correctly handle edge cases, such as when the number of zeros at the end of the number is less than k, or when the number starts with zeros (if such cases are allowed). 

Here is an example of how to solve this problem correctly in Python:
```python
def min_digits_to_remove(n, k):
    n = str(n)
    min_removals = len(n)
    for i in range(2**len(n)):
        bin_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(len(n))
        new_num = ''
        for j, digit in enumerate(n):
            if bin_str[j] == '1':
                new_num += digit
        if new_num and int(new_num) % (10**k) == 0:
            min_removals = min(min_removals, len(n) - len(new_num))
    return min_removals

n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(min_digits_to_remove(n, k))
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a string representation of an integer and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9. It calculates the number of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until it encounters `k` zeros or reaches the beginning of `n`. If `k` zeros are found, it prints the count of non-zero digits encountered before the `k` zeros. If `k` zeros are not found, it prints the length of `n` minus 1. The function does not handle cases where `n` is an empty string, `k` is outside the specified range, or `n` contains non-digit characters. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that a value has been printed to the console, which is either the count of non-zero digits or the length of `n` minus 1, and the input parameters `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
