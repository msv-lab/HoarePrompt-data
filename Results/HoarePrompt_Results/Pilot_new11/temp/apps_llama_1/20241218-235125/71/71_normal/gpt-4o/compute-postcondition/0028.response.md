Postcondition: **`n` is a string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either equal to `k` if `k` '0's were found from the end of `n`, or less than `k` if the end of `n` was reached without finding `k` '0's, and `to_remove` is the count of non-'0' digits encountered before the loop terminated. Additionally, `count_zeros` is less than `k`, indicating that the end of `n` was reached without finding `k` '0's.**
