Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description. It converts the input numbers represented in different bases to their base 10 equivalents and then compares them. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the base 10 equivalent of a number given its digits and base, and it handles edge cases such as an empty input list.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case, including the examples provided. It correctly handles varying lengths and values of the input numbers, and it does not modify the input parameters. The assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program holds, as the problem description specifies the input format and constraints.

The output hints also agree with the code, and they provide examples of how the function `func_1` works. The hints explain that the function converts a number represented by a list of digits in a given base to its base 10 equivalent, and they describe the function's behavior for different inputs.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases, and it provides the correct output for the examples provided in the problem description.
