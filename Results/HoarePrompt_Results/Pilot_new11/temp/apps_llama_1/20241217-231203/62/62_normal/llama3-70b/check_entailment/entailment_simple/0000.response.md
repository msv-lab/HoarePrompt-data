Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads the number of digits `n` and the base `bx` for the first number `X`, then reads the digits of `X`. It does the same for the second number `Y`, reading the number of digits `m` and the base `by`, and then the digits of `Y`.

2. The program converts the numbers to base 10: The function `func_1` takes a list of digits and a base as input and returns the base 10 equivalent of the number represented by those digits in that base. It does this by multiplying the current result by the base and adding the current digit in each iteration of the loop.

3. The program compares the two numbers: After converting both numbers to base 10, the program compares them using if-elif-else statements. If `X` is less than `Y`, it prints "<"; if `X` is greater than `Y`, it prints ">"; otherwise, it prints "=".

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem description. It correctly converts numbers from any base between 2 and 40 to base 10 and compares them. The assumption that the input will be valid simplifies the program, as it doesn't need to handle edge cases such as invalid bases or digits.

For example, given the input:
```
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7
```
The program correctly converts `X` to base 10: `X = 1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 47`. Similarly, it converts `Y` to base 10: `Y = 4*10^1 + 7*10^0 = 47`. Then, it compares the two numbers and prints "=" because `X` is equal to `Y`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements in the problem description and is correct.
