To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `digits` is a list of integers with at least 2 digits.
- `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive).
- All elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1.
- `result` equals `digit * base + digit`.

The loop statement is `for digit in digits:`. This means that the loop iterates over each element in the `digits` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `digits` has at least 2 digits, implying there is at least one more digit to process.
- `base` remains the same as it's not modified by the loop iteration.
- The condition that all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1 also remains unchanged.
- `result` is calculated based on the current `digit` and `base`, so its value will change with each iteration but the formula remains the same.

For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move on to the next `digit` in the `digits` list. Therefore, the states that need adjustment are:
- The current `digit` should be the next one in the list. Since we are not given the exact value of the current `digit` but rather conditions about the list (`digits` has at least 2 digits), we focus on the list's properties.
- The list `digits` must still have at least one more element to iterate over (since we're considering the next iteration), meaning it must have had at least 2 elements before the last iteration to have a "next" element now.
- The `result` calculation will depend on the new `digit` and the unchanged `base`.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers with at least 2 digits (considering the next iteration), `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), all elements in `digits` are between 0 and `base` - 1, `result` equals the new `digit * base + digit`**
