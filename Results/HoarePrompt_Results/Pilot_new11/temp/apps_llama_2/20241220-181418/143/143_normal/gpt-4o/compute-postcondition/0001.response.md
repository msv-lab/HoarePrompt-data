The code creates a new list `dp` and initializes it with 31 elements, all of which are equal to `max_cost`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, and `dp` is a list of 31 integers, all of which are equal to `max_cost` (10^18)**
