The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`. Given that `i` is 3, `vol` is 1, and `j` is 1, the expression simplifies to `dp[3] = min(dp[3], dp[3 - 1] + costs[1])`, which further simplifies to `dp[3] = min(dp[3], dp[2] + costs[1])`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, `j` is 1, `vol` is 1, and `dp[3]` is the minimum between its previous value and `dp[2] + costs[1]`.
