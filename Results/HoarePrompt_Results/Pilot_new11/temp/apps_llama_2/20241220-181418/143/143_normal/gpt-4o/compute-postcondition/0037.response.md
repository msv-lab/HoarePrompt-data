The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function returns the minimum achievable cost.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, L, and costs, and returns the minimum achievable cost based on the input values of n, L, and the list of costs.**
