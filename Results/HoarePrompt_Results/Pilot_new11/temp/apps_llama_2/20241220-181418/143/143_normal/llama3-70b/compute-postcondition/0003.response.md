The value of `dp[0]` is updated to 0, while the other elements of `dp` remain `float('inf')`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, and `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, and `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`.**
