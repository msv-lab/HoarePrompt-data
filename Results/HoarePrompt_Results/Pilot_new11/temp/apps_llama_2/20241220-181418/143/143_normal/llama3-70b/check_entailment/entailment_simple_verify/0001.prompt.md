You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.

10000 1000 100 10

Output
10

Input

Output
30

Input

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue lies in the line `vol = 2 ** j - 1`. According to the problem description, a single bottle of type `i` has volume `2^i - 1` liters. However, in the code, `vol` is calculated as `2 ** j - 1`, where `j` is the index of the cost in the `costs` list. This assumes that the index `j` is equivalent to the type `i`, which is not necessarily true. 

The correct code should be `vol = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1` because list indices in Python start at 0, but the problem description starts the type `i` at 1.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly: if the input is `2 3` and the costs are `10 100`, the program will calculate `vol` as `2 ** 0 - 1 = 0` and `2 ** 1 - 1 = 1` for the two types of bottles, respectively. However, according to the problem description, the volumes should be `2 ** 1 - 1 = 1` and `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3` liters, respectively. 

This incorrect calculation will lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of types of bottles in the store and L is the required amount of lemonade in liters. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2,..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9), which represent the costs of bottles of different types, where a bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters.
def func():
    n, L = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, and `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and for each `i` from 1 to `L`, `dp[i]` is the minimum cost to achieve a total volume of `i` using volumes defined by `2
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
