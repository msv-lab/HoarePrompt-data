You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----

Output
30

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, L) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** j - 1
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
    print(dp[L] if dp[L] != float('inf') else -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to buy at least L liters of lemonade.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `L + 1` with all elements set to infinity, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 0. This is because it costs 0 to buy 0 liters of lemonade.

2. It iterates over each possible amount of lemonade from 1 to L, and for each amount, it checks all possible bottle types.

3. For each bottle type, it calculates the volume of the bottle and checks if it can be used to make up the current amount of lemonade. If it can, it updates the minimum cost `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and the cost of the current bottle plus the minimum cost of the remaining amount `dp[i - vol]`.

4. Finally, it prints the minimum cost `dp[L]` to buy at least L liters of lemonade, or -1 if it's not possible to buy L liters of lemonade.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- When the required amount of lemonade is less than the volume of the smallest bottle, it will still try to find the minimum cost by using the smallest bottle.
- When there are multiple ways to buy the required amount of lemonade, it will choose the one with the minimum cost.
- When it's not possible to buy the required amount of lemonade, it will print -1.

The program also passes all the provided test cases, which further confirms its correctness. 

However, one potential issue is that the program does not handle the case where the input values are invalid (e.g., negative numbers). But according to the problem description, the input values are guaranteed to be within certain ranges, so this is not a concern in this case. 

In summary, the program is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the minimum cost to produce a required amount of lemonade, in liters, using bottles of different volumes and costs. It accepts two lines of input: the first line contains two integers, `n` (the number of bottle types) and `L` (the required amount of lemonade), and the second line contains `n` integers representing the costs of each bottle type. The function returns the minimum cost to achieve the required volume of lemonade, or -1 if it's not possible to achieve the required volume with the given bottle types. The function considers all possible combinations of bottle types to find the minimum cost, taking into account the volume of each bottle type, which is calculated as 2^i - 1 liters for the i-th bottle type. If the required volume cannot be achieved with the given bottle types, the function returns -1, indicating that it's not possible to produce the required amount of lemonade with the available bottles.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
