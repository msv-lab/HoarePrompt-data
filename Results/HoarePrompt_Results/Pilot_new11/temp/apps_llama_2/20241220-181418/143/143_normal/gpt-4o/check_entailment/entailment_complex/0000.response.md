Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately implement the dynamic programming approach required to solve the given problem. 

One of the main issues with this program is the way it updates the `dp` array. The line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for each power of 2. 

In the problem description, it is stated that a single bottle of type i has volume 2^i - 1 liters and costs c_i roubles. Therefore, when calculating the minimum cost for each power of 2, we should be comparing the cost of the current bottle type with the minimum cost of achieving the current volume by using smaller bottle types.

However, in the given program, it is comparing the cost of the current bottle type with the cost of achieving double the volume of the previous bottle type, which is not the correct approach.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for each possible combination of bottles that can achieve the target volume L.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a dynamic programming approach that calculates the minimum cost for each possible volume from 1 to L, considering all possible combinations of bottles that can achieve each volume.

Here is an example of a correct implementation in Python:

```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        volume = 2 ** i - 1
        cost = costs[i - 1]
        for j in range(volume, L + 1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - volume] + cost)

    return dp[L]
```

This implementation correctly calculates the minimum cost for each possible volume from 1 to L, considering all possible combinations of bottles that can achieve each volume. It uses a dynamic programming approach to store the minimum cost for each volume in the `dp` array and updates these costs iteratively based on the costs of the available bottle types.
