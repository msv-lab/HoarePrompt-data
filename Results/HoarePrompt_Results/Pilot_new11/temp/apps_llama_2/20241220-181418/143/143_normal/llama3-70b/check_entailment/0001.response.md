Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue lies in the line `vol = 2 ** j - 1`. According to the problem description, a single bottle of type `i` has volume `2^i - 1` liters. However, in the code, `vol` is calculated as `2 ** j - 1`, where `j` is the index of the cost in the `costs` list. This assumes that the index `j` is equivalent to the type `i`, which is not necessarily true. 

The correct code should be `vol = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1` because list indices in Python start at 0, but the problem description starts the type `i` at 1.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly: if the input is `2 3` and the costs are `10 100`, the program will calculate `vol` as `2 ** 0 - 1 = 0` and `2 ** 1 - 1 = 1` for the two types of bottles, respectively. However, according to the problem description, the volumes should be `2 ** 1 - 1 = 1` and `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3` liters, respectively. 

This incorrect calculation will lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is not correct.
