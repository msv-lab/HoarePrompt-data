Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and at least 3, `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[3]` is the minimum between the minimum of its previous value and `dp[2] + costs[1]` and `costs[2]`, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3; otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part***
