The code `n, L = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of two integers input by the user to the variables `n` and `L`. The value of `n` is the number of types of bottles in the store, which is between 1 and 30 (inclusive), and the value of `L` is the required amount of lemonade in liters, which is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
