To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

The other variables (`n`, `L`, `costs`, `i`, `dp[0]`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and the condition related to `vol` and `dp[3]`) do not depend on the loop variable `j` and are not directly affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least 3, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 3, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `costs[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `dp[1] + costs[0]`, `j` is 1, and if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[3]` is the minimum between its previous value (if any) and `dp[3 - vol] + costs[0]`.**
