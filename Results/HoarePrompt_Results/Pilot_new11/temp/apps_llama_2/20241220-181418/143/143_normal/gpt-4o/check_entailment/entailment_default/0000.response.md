Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of the minimum cost. The code incorrectly uses the line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` to update the minimum cost for each power of 2. This line assumes that the cost of achieving a power of 2 is always less than or equal to twice the cost of achieving the previous power of 2, which is not necessarily true.

For example, consider the input `n = 2, L = 3` and `costs = [10, 100]`. In this case, the code will calculate `dp[0] = 10` and `dp[1] = 100`. However, the code will then update `dp[1] = min(100, 2 * 10) = 20`, which is incorrect because the actual cost of achieving `2^1` (2 liters) is 100, not 20. This incorrect update will lead to an incorrect minimum cost calculation.

The correct approach would be to initialize `dp` with the costs of each power of 2 and then iterate over the powers of 2 in descending order, subtracting the largest possible power of 2 from `L` at each step, and updating the minimum cost accordingly. The code should not update the minimum cost based on the previous power of 2.

A correct implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(31):
        dp[i] = c[i] if i < len(c) else max_cost
    
    answer = max_cost
    for mask in range(1 << 31):
        current_cost = 0
        current_L = 0
        for i in range(31):
            if (mask & (1 << i)) > 0:
                current_cost += dp[i]
                current_L += (1 << i) - 1
        if current_L >= L:
            answer = min(answer, current_cost)
    return answer
```

This implementation correctly calculates the minimum cost by iterating over all possible combinations of powers of 2 and selecting the combination that achieves the target value `L` with the minimum cost.
