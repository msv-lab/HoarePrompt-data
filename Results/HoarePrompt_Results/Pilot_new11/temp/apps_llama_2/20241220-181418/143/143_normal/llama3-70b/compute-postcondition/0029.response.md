According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `costs` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `min(float('inf'), costs[1])`, if `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` is the minimum of the minimum of `dp[1] + costs[0]` and `costs[0]`, and `min(float('inf'), costs[1]) + costs[1]`, `j` is 2, and `vol` is 1**
