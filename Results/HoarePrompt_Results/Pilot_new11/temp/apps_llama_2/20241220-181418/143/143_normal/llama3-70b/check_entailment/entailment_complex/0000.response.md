Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue lies in the range of the outer loop in the dynamic programming solution. The loop only iterates up to `L` (the required amount of lemonade), but the input can have a larger volume than `L` if a bottle of type `i` has volume `2^i - 1` greater than `L`. 

In such cases, the program will not consider using bottles with volumes greater than `L` to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade. However, the problem description states that it is possible to buy more lemonade than required, as long as the cost is minimized.

For instance, consider the case where `n = 1`, `L = 1`, and `c_1 = 10` (the cost of a bottle with volume `2^1 - 1 = 1` liter). If there is another bottle type with volume `2^2 - 1 = 3` liters and cost `20`, the program will not consider this bottle, even though buying it and having 2 liters of extra lemonade might be cheaper than buying the 1-liter bottle.

To fix this issue, the program should iterate over all possible bottle types and consider their volumes, not just those that are less than or equal to `L`. 

Here is a correct version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n, L = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [float('inf')] * (L + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, L + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            vol = 2 ** (j + 1) - 1  # calculate volume for each bottle type
            if vol <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - vol] + costs[j])
            else:
                break  # stop considering larger bottles
    print(dp[L] if dp[L]!= float('inf') else -1)
```
In this corrected version, we calculate the volume of each bottle type and consider using it if its volume is less than or equal to the current amount of lemonade we are trying to buy. If the volume of the bottle is greater than the current amount, we stop considering larger bottles. This way, we ensure that we are considering all possible combinations of bottle types to find the minimum cost.
