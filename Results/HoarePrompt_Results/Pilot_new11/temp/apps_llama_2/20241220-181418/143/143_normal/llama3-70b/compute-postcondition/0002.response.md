The code initializes a list `dp` with `L + 1` elements, all set to positive infinity. The value of `n` is between 1 and 30 (inclusive), the value of `L` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `costs` is a list of input integers. 

The values of `n`, `L`, and `costs` are not changed by the code. The new variable `dp` is introduced and is a list of length `L + 1`, with all elements initialized to `float('inf')`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, and `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with all elements equal to `float('inf')`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, and `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` with all elements equal to `float('inf')`.**
