To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the for loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, L + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `L` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `L + 1`. The variable `i` will take values from 1 to `L` (inclusive) in each iteration.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive)
- `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)
- `costs` is a list of input integers
- `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`

For the loop to execute, we need:
- `L` to be at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the initial state.
- `i` to be initialized to 1, as it is the starting point of the range.

Thus, the adjusted state before the loop starts should reflect that `i` is initialized to 1, and since `L` is already defined within the required range, no adjustments are needed for `L`, `n`, `costs`, or `dp`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of input integers, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where `dp[0]` is 0 and all other elements are `float('inf')`, `i` is 1**
