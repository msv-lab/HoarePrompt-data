Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max_cost` is 10^18, `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` is the minimum of `costs[i]` and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i < n`, and `2^i * costs[0]` for `i >= n`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the elements of `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are `max_cost` (10^18), `answer` is `10^18`, if `L >= 1 << 30`, then `L` is `L - 2^30`, `current_cost` is `2^30 * costs[0]`, and `i` is 30, otherwise the state remains unchanged.**
