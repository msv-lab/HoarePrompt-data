The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. The absolute difference is calculated using the `abs` function, which returns the non-negative value of the difference between `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are not changed by the code, but the absolute difference between them is printed. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, `abs(x - y)`, has been printed**
