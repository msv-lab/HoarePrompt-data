Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem states that in one second, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle. However, the given program simply calculates the absolute difference between the initial and final side lengths, which does not account for the constraints of the problem.

For example, if the input is 10 5, the program will output 5, but the correct solution would be to change the sides of the triangle in the following order: (10, 10, 10) → (10, 10, 5) → (10, 5, 5) → (5, 5, 5), which takes 3 steps, not 5.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. We need to find the minimum number of steps required to transform the initial equilateral triangle into the final equilateral triangle while maintaining the triangle inequality at each step.

A correct implementation would involve finding the shortest path in a graph or using a similar approach to solve the problem, taking into account the constraints of the problem. The given program does not implement such logic and therefore does not correctly solve the problem. 

In the provided code the approach is just doing `abs(x - y)` this means that the program assumes that we can change all the sides at the same time which is not allowed according to the problem description, which says that we can only modify the length of a single side of the current triangle at a time.
