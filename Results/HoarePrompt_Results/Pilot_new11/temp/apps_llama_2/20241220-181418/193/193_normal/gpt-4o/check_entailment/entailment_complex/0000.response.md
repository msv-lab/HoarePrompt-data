Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length x into an equilateral triangle of side length y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.

The key insight here is that the minimum number of seconds is equal to the minimum number of operations needed to change the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Since the triangle remains equilateral in the initial and final states, we can focus on reducing the length of one side at a time.

The program calculates this minimum number of seconds as `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which is equivalent to the ceiling of `(x - y) / 2`. This formula makes sense because we need to reduce the length of each side by at least `x - y` units, and we can do this in two operations: reducing the length of one side by `x - y` and then reducing the other two sides by the remaining amount needed to reach the target length.

The use of the ceiling function ensures that we account for cases where `x - y` is odd, in which case we need one additional operation to reduce the length of the remaining side.

Since the program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
