Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program takes two integers as input, `x` and `y`, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. 

The program calculates and prints the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length `x`. This is achieved by calculating the ceiling of the difference between `x` and `y` divided by 2, which is done using the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. This formula correctly handles both even and odd differences.

The given examples in the problem description also validate the correctness of the program. For instance, when `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the program correctly outputs `4`, which is the minimum number of seconds required to transform the equilateral triangle of side length `6` to one of side length `3`.

Similarly, for `x = 8` and `y = 5`, the program outputs `3`, and for `x = 22` and `y = 4`, it outputs `6`, both of which are correct according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the required logic and produces the expected output for every potential case within the given constraints.
