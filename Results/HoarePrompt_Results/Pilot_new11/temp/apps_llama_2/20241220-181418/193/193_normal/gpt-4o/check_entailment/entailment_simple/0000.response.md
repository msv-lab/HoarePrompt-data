Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the minimum number of operations required to change an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to an equilateral triangle of side length `y`.

Here's why it's correct:

* The key insight is that we can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle in each second, as long as the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., has positive area). 
* Since we're starting with an equilateral triangle and want to end with an equilateral triangle, the optimal strategy is to always change the side length of one of the sides by 1, either increasing or decreasing, to minimize the total number of operations.
* When `x` and `y` are both odd or both even, the difference `x - y` is even. In this case, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations as `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2 = (x - y) // 2`.
* When `x - y` is odd (i.e., one of `x` or `y` is odd and the other is even), `(x - y) // 2` calculates the number of pairs of operations (one increasing and one decreasing) that we can perform. The remaining `(x - y) % 2` operation is needed to account for the final adjustment to reach the target length `y`. Thus, `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` correctly calculates the minimum number of operations in this case.

Therefore, the program accurately implements the problem description and is correct.
