The function accepts two integer inputs from the user, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. It does not explicitly check or enforce the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 on the input integers, leaving it up to the user to provide valid input. After execution, the program's state is such that the absolute difference between the two input integers has been printed to the console, with no return value provided by the function. The function's execution does not modify the original input values in any way, as it only performs a calculation and output based on those inputs.
