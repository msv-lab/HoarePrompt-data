The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` assigns the input values to `x` and `y` as integers. However, it does not guarantee that the conditions `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000` will hold after the assignment, because the input values could be anything.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers assigned from input, but the conditions that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000` initially held may no longer be valid because the new values of `x` and `y` depend on the input provided.**
