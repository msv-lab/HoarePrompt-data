The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters x and y. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is expected to operate within the boundaries defined by the integers x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.


Since the function does not explicitly accept parameters x and y, and there is no information provided about the output or return value of the function, it is impossible to accurately describe the functionality without making assumptions.


However, assuming the function is designed to perform some operation based on the constraints provided for x and y, a hypothetical description could be:


The function `func` implicitly operates under the constraints that two integers x and y exist, such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Without explicit parameters or a defined return value, the functionality cannot be precisely determined. 


Functionality: **The function implicitly operates under specific integer constraints but lacks explicit parameters and a defined return value.**
