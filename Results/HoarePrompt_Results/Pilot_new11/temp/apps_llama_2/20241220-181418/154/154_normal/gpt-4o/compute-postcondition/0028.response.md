To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code line `max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)` updates the value of `max_points` by comparing its current value with the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved` and then assigning the maximum of these two values back to `max_points`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`
- `remaining_time` is the remainder of the original `remaining_time` divided by the greatest common divisor of all subtask times in the list `t`, or 0 if all remaining time is used

The code only updates `max_points`, so we only need to consider how `max_points` is affected. 

- The value of `max_points` becomes the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`. 
- Since `points` equals `complete_tasks * (k + 1)` and `subtasks_solved` equals the minimum of its original value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `points + subtasks_solved` equals `complete_tasks * (k + 1)` plus the minimum of its original value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its original value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`
- `remaining_time` is the remainder of the original `remaining_time` divided by the greatest common divisor of all subtask times in the list `t`, or 0 if all remaining time is used
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)` plus the minimum of its original value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.
