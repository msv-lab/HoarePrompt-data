Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 3 subtask times, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtask_time` is the third subtask time in `t`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` remains the same, if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1) + 0` if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, and `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + max_subtasks_for_this_task`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is equal to `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `remaining_time` is `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`; otherwise, all variables retain their previous values.**
