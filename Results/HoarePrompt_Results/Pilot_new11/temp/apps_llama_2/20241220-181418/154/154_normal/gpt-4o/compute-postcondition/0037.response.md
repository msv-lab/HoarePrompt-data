Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 element, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtasks_solved` is `0`, the current value of `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and is greater than or equal to the current value of `subtask_time` which is the first element in the list `t`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)` plus the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` is less than or equal to `M`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`**
