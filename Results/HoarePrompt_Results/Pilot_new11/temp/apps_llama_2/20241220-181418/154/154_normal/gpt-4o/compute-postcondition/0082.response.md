Output State: **The program returns max_points, which is the maximum value of points + subtasks_solved for all iterations, or 0 if the loop does not execute, where the initial state is constrained by the given conditions: `n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is an integer between 0 and 2*10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000, and `total_time_per_task` is an integer between `k` and `k * 1000000`.**
