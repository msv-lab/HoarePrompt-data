The given code is `max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time`. We need to calculate the new value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

In the initial state, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time` and `remaining_time` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time`. 

When we calculate `max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time`, since `remaining_time` is the remainder of the division of `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task)` by `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` will always be less than `subtask_time`. 

Therefore, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will be `0` because any number less than `subtask_time` divided by `subtask_time` will result in `0`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, 
`k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, 
`M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, 
`t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times, 
`total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, 
`subtask_time` is the second subtask time in `t`, 
`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `0`, 
`remaining_time` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time`, 
`points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, 
`time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, 
`complete_tasks` remains the same, 
`max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1) + 0` if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, 
`subtasks_solved` is the old value of `subtasks_solved` plus `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 subtask times, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtask_time` is the second subtask time in `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `0`, `remaining_time` is `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) % subtask_time`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` remains the same, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1) + 0` if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, `subtasks_solved` is the old value of `subtasks_solved` plus `(M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task) // subtask_time`**
