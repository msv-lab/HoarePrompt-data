To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the for loop statement:
```
for subtask_time in t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```
We know that `t` is a list of `k` integers, and it must have at least 1 element.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 element
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must have at least 2 elements because the loop iterates over each element in `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has at least 1 element, so for the loop to execute again, `t` must have at least 2 elements, and `subtask_time` should be the second element in `t` (since we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration).

Additionally, since `subtask_time` is updated to the next element in `t` at the start of each iteration, the index of `subtask_time` in `t` increases by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 2 elements, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtask_time` is the second element in `t`.**
