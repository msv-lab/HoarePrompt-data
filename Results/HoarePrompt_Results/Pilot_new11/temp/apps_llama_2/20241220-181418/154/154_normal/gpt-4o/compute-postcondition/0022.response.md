To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given code and how it affects the variables. The code is calculating `max_subtasks_for_this_task` based on `remaining_time` and `subtask_time`. However, `remaining_time` and `subtask_time` are not defined in the initial state. For the purpose of this analysis, let's assume `remaining_time` and `subtask_time` are defined and their values are derived from other given variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 3 subtask times
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`

And the code:
```python
max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
```

However, `remaining_time` and `subtask_time` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. To provide a meaningful output, we'll assume that `remaining_time` could be related to `total_time_per_task` and `subtask_time` could be related to the elements of `t`.

If we consider `remaining_time` as part of `total_time_per_task` and `subtask_time` as one of the times in `t`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` would be calculated based on how many subtasks can be completed within the `remaining_time` given the time each subtask takes (`subtask_time`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 3 subtask times, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `remaining_time // subtask_time`**
