Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that 3 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 3 < `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `i` is 3, if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[3][3]` is the maximum of its previous value (`dp[3][2]`) and `dp[2][3 - t[2]] + 1`, otherwise no changes are made to `dp[3][3]`.***
