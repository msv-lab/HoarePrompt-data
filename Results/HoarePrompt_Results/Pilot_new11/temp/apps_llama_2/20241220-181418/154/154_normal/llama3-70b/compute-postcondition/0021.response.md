The given code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, `dp[2][1]` is updated to be equal to `dp[2][0]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, 
`k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 2 and 2 <= `k` <= 45, 
`M` is an input integer such that 1 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, 
`t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, 
`t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, 
`dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[2][1]` = `dp[2][0]`, 
`i` is 2, 
`j` is 1.
