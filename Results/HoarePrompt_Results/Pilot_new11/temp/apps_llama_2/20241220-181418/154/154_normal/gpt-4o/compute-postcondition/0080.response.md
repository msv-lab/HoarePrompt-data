To calculate the result, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is: 
```python
max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
```
From the initial state, we know that `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after solving all possible subtasks.

However, there are some variables in the code that are not defined in the initial state, which are `max_points` and `points`. Also, `complete_tasks` is not defined. 

The code updates the value of `max_points` by taking the maximum of its current value and the sum of `points` and `subtasks_solved`. 

Since the previous values of `max_points` and `points` are unknown, we can only say that `max_points` is now the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after solving all possible subtasks, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after solving all possible subtasks, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`**
