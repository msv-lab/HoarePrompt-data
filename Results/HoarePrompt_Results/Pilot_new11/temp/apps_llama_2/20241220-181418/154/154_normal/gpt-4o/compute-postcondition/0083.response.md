The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 45, `M` is an integer between 0 and 2*10^9, and `t` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000000. The function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum value of points plus subtasks solved for all iterations, or 0 if the loop does not execute. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and t, and returns the maximum value of points plus subtasks solved for all iterations, or 0 if no iterations occur, based on the given constraints for n, k, M, and t.**
