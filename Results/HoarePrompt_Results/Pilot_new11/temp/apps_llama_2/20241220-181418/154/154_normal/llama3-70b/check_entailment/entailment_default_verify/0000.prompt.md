You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
    print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not accurately solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum points Polycarp can earn. 

The program tries to find the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the given time limit `M`, but it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can earn extra points by completing all subtasks of a task. 

The line `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` only considers the subtasks of one task, and does not take into account the possibility of completing multiple tasks.

Additionally, the line `print(sum((dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))) + sum((1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)))` tries to calculate the total points by summing up the points from each subtask and adding 1 for each task that is completed. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that Polycarp can earn points by completing subtasks from multiple tasks.

A correct approach would be to use a more complex dynamic programming algorithm that considers all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks, and calculates the maximum points that can be earned within the given time limit. 

For example, if we have `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `M = 5`, and `t = [1, 4]`, the program will output `3`, but the correct output should be `4` because Polycarp can complete the first subtask of both tasks (earning 2 points) and then complete the second subtask of one task (earning 2 points).

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and a series of integers t_j, and returns the sum of the maximum number of items of each type that can sum up to M without exceeding it, plus the count of types where the maximum number of items equals the type number. The function takes into account all potential edge cases, including when k is 0, and when M is 0 or exceeds the sum of all t_j values. The input parameters n, k, M, and t_j are integers within specified ranges (1 <= n <= 45, 1 <= k <= 45, 0 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, and 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k), and the function sorts the t_j values in ascending order before calculating the maximum number of items of each type that can sum up to M. The final state of the program after it concludes is the printed result, which is the sum of the maximum number of items of each type that can sum up to M without exceeding it, plus the count of types where the maximum number of items equals the type number, covering all potential cases and edge cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
