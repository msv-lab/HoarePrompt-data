Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 3 elements, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtask_time` is the third element in `t`. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, then `max_subtasks_for_this_task` equals `0`, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + 0`, and `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`. If `remaining_time` is less than `subtask_time`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.***
