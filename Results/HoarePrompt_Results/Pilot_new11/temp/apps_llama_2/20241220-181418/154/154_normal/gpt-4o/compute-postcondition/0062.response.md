According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `t`. If the list `t` has at least 1 subtask time, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states to ensure that the loop can execute. 

We know that `t` is a list of `k` integers, and `k` is an integer where `1 <= k <= 45`. Therefore, `t` must have at least 1 subtask time for the loop to execute. 

We also know that `subtasks_solved` is 0 before the loop starts. Since `subtasks_solved` is not used in the loop condition, its value does not affect the execution of the loop. 

The variable `subtask_time` is used in the loop, and it takes the value of each subtask time in `t` during each iteration. Before the loop starts, `subtask_time` is not defined, so we need to adjust its state to be the first subtask time in `t`.

State: **`n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`, `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`, `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`, `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j` and `t` must have at least 1 subtask time, `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, otherwise the loop or if statement is terminated, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1) + 0` if `time_used` does not exceed `M`, and `subtask_time` is the first subtask time in `t`**
