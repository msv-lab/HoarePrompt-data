#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 45, M is an integer such that 0 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, and t_j are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k.
def func():
    n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t.sort()
    dp = [([0] * (M + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
            if j >= t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that 0 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`k` + 1) x (`M` + 1) where `dp[k][j]` for 1 <= `j` <= `M` represents the maximum number of items of `k` types that can sum up to `j` without exceeding it, or all zeros if `k` is 0.
    print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if 
    dp[i][M] == i))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and a series of integers t_j, and returns the sum of the maximum number of items of each type that can sum up to M without exceeding it, plus the count of types where the maximum number of items equals the type number. The function takes into account all potential edge cases, including when k is 0, and when M is 0 or exceeds the sum of all t_j values. The input parameters n, k, M, and t_j are integers within specified ranges (1 <= n <= 45, 1 <= k <= 45, 0 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, and 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k), and the function sorts the t_j values in ascending order before calculating the maximum number of items of each type that can sum up to M. The final state of the program after it concludes is the printed result, which is the sum of the maximum number of items of each type that can sum up to M without exceeding it, plus the count of types where the maximum number of items equals the type number, covering all potential cases and edge cases.
