The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum value between its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

Here, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `t` is a sorted list of input integers. Since `i` equals 1, `i - 1` equals 0. The code assumes that `dp[0][j - t[0]]` exists, which means `j - t[0]` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `M`. However, we do not have information about `t[0]`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `dp[1][3]`. 

Given that `dp[1][3]` equals `dp[1][2]`, we can say that `dp[1][3]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`dp[1][2]`) and `dp[0][3 - t[0]] + 1`. 

So, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9 and M must be greater than 2, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) where `dp[1][3]` equals max(`dp[1][2]`, `dp[0][3 - t[0]] + 1`), `i` is 1, `j` is 3.
