Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly calculate the maximum points that can be achieved by completing tasks and subtasks within a given time limit M. The issue is that it iterates over the subtasks in ascending order of their time requirements, and it assigns all the remaining time to the current subtask. This means that it does not consider the optimal strategy of solving the subtasks with the lowest time requirements across all the remaining tasks.

For example, if we have 3 tasks, each with 2 subtasks (1, 3) and (2, 4), and a total time limit of 6, the code will complete the first task (1+3) and then solve 2 subtasks from the second task with time requirements 2, resulting in a total of 5 points. However, the optimal strategy would be to complete 3 subtasks with time requirements 1 from each task, resulting in a total of 3 points from these subtasks, and then solve 3 more subtasks with time requirements 2 from each task, resulting in a total of 6 points.

To fix this issue, the code should use a more sophisticated strategy to distribute the remaining time among the tasks and subtasks, such as a greedy algorithm that always solves the subtask with the lowest time requirement across all the remaining tasks. 

However, using the current approach, the code would need a more complex solution, probably involving dynamic programming to find the optimal way of solving the tasks and subtasks. 

Here is a high-level idea of how you can solve this:
- Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum points you can get by solving i tasks and having j time left.
- Iterate over each task and for each task, iterate over each possible number of subtasks you can solve in that task.
- For each subtask, calculate the time it takes and the points you get and update dp[i][j] accordingly.
- Finally, return the maximum points you can get which is dp[n][M].

Here's some sample Python code that demonstrates this:

```python
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    dp = [[0]*(M+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, M+1):
            for subtasks in range(k+1):
                time = sum(t[:subtasks])
                if time <= j:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-time] + subtasks + (subtasks == k))
    return max(dp[n])
