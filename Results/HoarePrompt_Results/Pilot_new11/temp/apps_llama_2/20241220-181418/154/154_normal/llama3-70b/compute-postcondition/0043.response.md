Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 3 and 3 <= `k` <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= `M` <= 2 * 10^9 and `M` must be greater than 1, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= `t_j` <= 1000000 for 1 <= `j` <= `k`, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `i` is 3, and the current value of `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`, then `dp[3][2]` equals the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2][2 - t[2]] + 1`.***
