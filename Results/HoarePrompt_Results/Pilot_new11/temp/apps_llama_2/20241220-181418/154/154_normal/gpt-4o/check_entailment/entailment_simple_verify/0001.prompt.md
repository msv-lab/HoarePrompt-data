You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it attempts to solve the subtasks with the remaining time after completing some tasks. The program simply tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time, without considering the optimal order of subtasks.

One potential case where the program fails is when there are multiple tasks, each with a mix of short and long subtasks. In such a case, the program might not choose the optimal set of subtasks to solve with the remaining time, leading to a suboptimal solution.

For example, consider the input:

5 5 20
1 2 4 8 16

In this case, the program might choose to complete some tasks and then solve some subtasks with the remaining time. However, it might not choose the optimal combination of tasks and subtasks to solve, leading to a suboptimal solution.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks, and choose the combination that maximizes the total points earned. This can be achieved by using a more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm with a more sophisticated strategy for choosing the next subtask to solve.

One possible solution is to use a 2D array to store the maximum points that can be earned with a given amount of time and a given number of tasks. The program can then fill in this array using dynamic programming, considering all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks.

Here is a high-level outline of the corrected algorithm:

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(M + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points that can be earned with `i` minutes of time and `j` tasks.
2. Fill in the `dp` array using dynamic programming, considering all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks.
3. The final answer is stored in `dp[M][n]`.

Here is a sample code to demonstrate this approach:
```python
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(M + 1)]
    for i in range(M + 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            for complete_tasks in range(min(j, i // sum(t)) + 1):
                time_used = complete_tasks * sum(t)
                if time_used > i:
                    break
                points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
                remaining_time = i - time_used
                subtasks_solved = 0
                for subtask_time in sorted(t):
                    if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                        max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                        subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                        remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
                subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], points + subtasks_solved)
    return dp[M][n]
```
This corrected algorithm should work correctly for all potential cases, considering all possible combinations of tasks and subtasks to maximize the total points earned.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
