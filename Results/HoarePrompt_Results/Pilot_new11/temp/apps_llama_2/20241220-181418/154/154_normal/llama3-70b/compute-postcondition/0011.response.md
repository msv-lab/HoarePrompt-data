The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t_j`, `t`, and `i` are not changed. The value of `j` is 2.

Since `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`, and given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, `dp[i][j]` now equals `dp[1][1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) where `dp[1][2]` equals `dp[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that `k` is at least 1 and 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 1 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, `t` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `dp` is a 2D list of size (k + 1) x (M + 1) where `dp[1][2]` equals `dp[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
