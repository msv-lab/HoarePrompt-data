To determine the state at the start of the for loop, we need to analyze the given code and the provided state before the loop starts.

Given state before the loop starts: 
- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`
- `t` is a list of `k` integers where `1 <= t_j <= 1000000` for all `j`
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `subtasks_solved` is `0`
- `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)` plus the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`
- `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` is less than or equal to `M`
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`

For loop statement: 
```python
for subtask_time in t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, it depends on the list `t` having at least one element. Since `t` is a list of `k` integers, it will always have at least one element because `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`. 

At the start of the loop, `subtask_time` will be the first element in the list `t`. 

The other variables' states do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but their values at this point are as follows: 
- `n` is an integer and `1 <= n <= 45`
- `k` is an integer and `1 <= k <= 45`
- `M` is an integer and `0 <= M <= 2*10^9`
- `total_time_per_task` is an integer and `k <= total_time_per_task <= k * 1000000`
- `points` is equal to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `subtasks_solved` is `0`
- `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `(complete_tasks + 1) * (k + 1)` plus the minimum of its original value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`
- `complete_tasks` is increased by 1 if `time_used` is less than or equal to `M`
- `time_used` is equal to `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
