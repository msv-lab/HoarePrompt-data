The code `t = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a list of input integers to the variable `t`. The `input()` function accepts a line of input and `split()` splits it into a list of strings. `map(int,...)` then converts each string in the list to an integer.

Given the initial state, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, and `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k. 

Since `t` is assigned the value of a list of input integers, we can say that `t` is a list of input integers. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 45, `k` is an input integer such that 1 <= k <= 45, `M` is an input integer such that 0 <= M <= 2 * 10^9, `t_j` are integers such that 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for 1 <= j <= k, and `t` is a list of input integers**
