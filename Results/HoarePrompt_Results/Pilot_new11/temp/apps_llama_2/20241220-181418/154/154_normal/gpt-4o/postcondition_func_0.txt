The function calculates and returns the maximum points that can be achieved by completing tasks and subtasks within a given time limit M. It takes into account the number of tasks n, the number of subtasks k per task, and the time required for each subtask t. The function iterates over all possible numbers of complete tasks, calculates the points achieved by completing these tasks and the remaining subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time, and returns the maximum points achievable. The function considers all possible edge cases, including when no tasks can be completed within the given time limit, and returns 0 in such cases. It also ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the number of remaining tasks multiplied by the number of subtasks per task. The function operates within the given constraints: 1 <= n <= 45, 1 <= k <= 45, 0 <= M <= 2*10^9, and 1 <= t_j <= 1000000 for all j.
