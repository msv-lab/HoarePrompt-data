The code `current_sum += int(ticket[i])` increments `current_sum` by the integer value of the digit at index `i` in `ticket`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `current_sum` is incremented by the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is equal to the integer value of the first digit of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 0, and `i` is 0**
