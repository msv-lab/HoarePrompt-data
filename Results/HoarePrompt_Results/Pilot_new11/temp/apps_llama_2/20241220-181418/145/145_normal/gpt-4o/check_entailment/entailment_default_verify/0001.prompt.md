You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: ### Code Analysis

The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `segment_sum`. The `func_1` function takes in two parameters: `n` (the number of digits in the ticket) and `ticket` (a string representing the golden ticket). It attempts to divide the ticket into segments with equal sums.

### Potential Issues

After analyzing the provided code, there are a few potential issues that can be observed:

1. **Incorrect Segment Sum Calculation**: The `segment_sum` function calculates the sum of a segment of the ticket. However, in the `func_1` function, this sum is calculated only for the first segment of the ticket. This might lead to incorrect results if the first segment is not representative of the rest of the ticket.

2. **Lack of Global Scope for `ticket`**: The `segment_sum` function uses `ticket` which is not defined in its scope. The `ticket` variable should be passed as an argument to this function.

3. **Insufficient Segment Length Checking**: The `func_1` function checks segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`. However, this check is incomplete because it doesn't consider all possible segment lengths. A segment can start at any position in the ticket, not just from the beginning.

4. **Incorrect Target Sum Calculation**: The target sum is calculated only for the first segment of the ticket. This might not be representative of the rest of the ticket.

### Code Corrections

To address these issues, the code needs to be corrected to properly calculate the target sum for each possible segment of the ticket, not just the first segment. Additionally, the `ticket` variable should be passed to the `segment_sum` function.

### Example of Incorrectness

Consider the case where `n = 4` and `ticket = "1122"`. The function `func_1` will incorrectly return `'NO'` because it doesn't consider all possible segment lengths and start positions.

### Correctness

Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem due to its incomplete and incorrect handling of segment lengths and sums. A correct solution would involve checking all possible segment lengths and start positions, ensuring that the target sum is correctly calculated for each segment. 

Here is a simple example of what a corrected version might look like:

```python
def is_lucky(n, ticket):
    def segment_sum(start, end):
        return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        for start in range(n - segment_length + 1):
            target_sum = segment_sum(start, start + segment_length - 1)
            current_sum = 0
            segment_count = 0
            i = 0
            while i < n:
                current_sum += int(ticket[i])
                if current_sum == target_sum:
                    current_sum = 0
                    segment_count += 1
                if current_sum > target_sum:
                    break
                i += 1
            if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```
Note: This example is still incomplete and may not cover all edge cases. A full solution would require considering all possible segmentations of the ticket.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `segment_sum` calculates and returns the sum of the integer values of the digits in a ticket from a specified start index to an end index, where both indices are inclusive and within the bounds of the ticket's length. The function assumes that the ticket is a globally accessible variable and that its indices are 0-based. It takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are expected to be integers such that 0 <= start <= end < n, where n is the number of digits in the ticket. The function does not perform any error checking on the input parameters or the ticket variable, so it assumes these constraints are met. The return value is the sum of the digits in the specified range. Note that the function does not handle cases where the ticket variable is not defined or is not a string of digits, and it does not account for potential overflow errors if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the return type. The function's execution does not modify the input parameters or the ticket variable; it only returns a calculated sum.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
