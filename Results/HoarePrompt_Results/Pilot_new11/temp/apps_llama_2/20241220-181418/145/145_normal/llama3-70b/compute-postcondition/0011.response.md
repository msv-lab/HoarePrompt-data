The code resets the value of `curr_sum` to 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

The `ticket` is still a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9'. 
The `total_sum` is still equal to the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even. 
The `target_sum` is still equal to `total_sum // 2`. 
The `segments` equals 1. 
The `digit` is still the first character in `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` equals 0, `segments` equals 1, `digit` is the first character in `ticket`**
