Functionality: **The function `segment_sum` calculates and returns the sum of the integer values of the digits in a ticket from a specified start index to an end index, where both indices are inclusive and within the bounds of the ticket's length. The function assumes that the ticket is a globally accessible variable and that its indices are 0-based. It takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are expected to be integers such that 0 <= start <= end < n, where n is the number of digits in the ticket. The function does not perform any error checking on the input parameters or the ticket variable, so it assumes these constraints are met. The return value is the sum of the digits in the specified range. Note that the function does not handle cases where the ticket variable is not defined or is not a string of digits, and it does not account for potential overflow errors if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the return type. The function's execution does not modify the input parameters or the ticket variable; it only returns a calculated sum.**
