The value of `segments` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the second character in `ticket`, `curr_sum` is increased by the value of `digit`, `segments` is `segments + 1`.
