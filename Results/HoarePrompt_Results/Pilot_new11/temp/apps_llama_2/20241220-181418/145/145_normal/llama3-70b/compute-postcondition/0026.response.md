Functionality: **This function, `func_1`, checks if a given string of digits, 'ticket', can be divided into at least two segments where the sum of the Unicode code points of the digits in each segment equals half of the total sum of the Unicode code points of all digits in 'ticket'. It returns `True` if such segments exist and `False` otherwise. The function first calculates the total sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in 'ticket' and checks if this sum is even. If the sum is not even, it immediately returns `False`. If the sum is even, it then iterates through 'ticket' to find segments that sum up to half of the total sum. The function counts the number of such segments and returns `True` if there are at least two segments, and `False` otherwise. Note that the function considers the Unicode code points of the characters, not their numeric values. For example, the character '0' has a Unicode code point of 48, not 0. The function handles strings of lengths between 2 and 100 and only considers strings consisting entirely of digits. If the input string does not meet these criteria, the function's behavior is not defined by the provided annotations or code.**
