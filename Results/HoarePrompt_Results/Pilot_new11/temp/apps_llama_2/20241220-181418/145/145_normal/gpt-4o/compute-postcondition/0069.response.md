Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of digits of length `n`, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first 3 digits of the original `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the last segment of digits in `ticket` that did not equal `target_sum` or 0 if it equals `target_sum`, and the current value of `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of segments in `ticket` whose sum equals `target_sum`, and the current value of `segment_count` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and the overall state reflects that there has been at least one segment sum equal to `target_sum` before the last segment, which did not equal `target_sum` or equals `target_sum` making `current_sum` 0**
