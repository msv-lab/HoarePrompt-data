Postcondition: **`ticket` is a string of digits such that 2 <= len(`ticket`) <= 100 and all characters in `ticket` are between '0' and '9', `total_sum` equals the sum of the Unicode code points of all characters in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` equals `total_sum // 2`, `digit` is the second character in `ticket`. If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `curr_sum` is 0 and `segments` is `segments + 1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `curr_sum` being increased by the value of `digit`.**
