The code updates the values of `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` by assigning them the integer values obtained from the input. 

The values of the other variables are not affected. 

The new values of `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers.

The output state includes the updated values of these variables and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the latest input integers between 1 and `n` and between 1 and `m` respectively, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, and `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuple elements, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration.**
