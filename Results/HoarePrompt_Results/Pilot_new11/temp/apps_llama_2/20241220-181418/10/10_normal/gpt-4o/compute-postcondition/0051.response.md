Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the first input, `y1` is the second coordinate of the first input, `x2` is the third coordinate of the first input, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the first input, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple element, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is the first coordinate of the second input, `y1_j` is the second coordinate of the second input, `x2_j` is the third coordinate of the second input, `y2_j` is the fourth coordinate of the second input, and if `i` equals `j`, the loop proceeds to the next iteration, otherwise, the program continues with the current state of variables as no other operations are specified in the if and else part**.
