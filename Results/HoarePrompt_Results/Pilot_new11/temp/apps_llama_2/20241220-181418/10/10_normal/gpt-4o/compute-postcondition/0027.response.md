Postcondition: **`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the first input, `y1` is the second coordinate of the first input, `x2` is the third coordinate of the first input, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the first input, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple element, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `left_count` is a list of at least one zero and `right_count` is a list where the first element is 1 and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, `left_count` and `right_count` retain their original values, `top_count` is a list of at least one zero, `bottom_count` is a list of at least one zero, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x1_j` is `x1_0`, `y1_j` is `y1_0`, `x2_j` is `x2_0`, `y2_j` is `y2_0`.**
