Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the third sofa, `y1` is the second coordinate of the third sofa, `x2` is the third coordinate of the third sofa, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the third sofa, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `j` is the next index in the sofas list, and if `i` equals `j`, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the program executes the next line of code***
