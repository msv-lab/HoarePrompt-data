The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables. 

Given that `i` equals `j`, and initially `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, for `i` to be equal to `j`, both must be 0 because `j` is initially 0 and `i` must have been changed to 0 to satisfy the condition `i` equals `j`.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index 1 in the `sofas` list, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `left_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the right of the corresponding sofa, `right_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the left of the corresponding sofa, `top_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas below the corresponding sofa, `bottom_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas above the corresponding sofa, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
