Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the first input, `y1` is the second coordinate of the first input, `x2` is the third coordinate of the first input, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the first input, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple element, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `sofas`, `y1_j` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `sofas`, `x2_j` is the third element of the tuple at index 2 in `sofas`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of the tuple at index 2 in `sofas`. If `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count[0]` is the previous value of `top_count[0]` plus 1. Additionally, if `y1` < `y1_j` and `y2` < `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[0]` is the previous value of `bottom_count[0]` plus 1. If `x1` > `x2_j` and `x2` > `x2_j`, then `left_count[0]` is the previous value of `left_count[0]` plus 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[0]` is the previous value of `right_count[0]` plus 1, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
