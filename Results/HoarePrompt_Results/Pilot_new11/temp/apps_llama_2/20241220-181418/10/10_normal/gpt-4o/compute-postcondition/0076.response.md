The value of `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `bottom_count[i]` is the number of sofas below the `i-th` sofa. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `d` remains an integer between 1 and 10^5. The values of `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb`, `sofas`, `left_count`, `top_count`, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the second sofa, `y1` is the second coordinate of the second sofa, `x2` is the third coordinate of the second sofa, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the second sofa, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements, `left_count` is a list where the first element is the number of sofas to the left of the first sofa and the rest are zeros, `top_count` is a list where the first element is the number of sofas above the first sofa and the rest are zeros, `bottom_count` is a list where the `i-th` element is the number of sofas below the `i-th` sofa plus 1 and the rest of elements remain with their previous values, `x1_j` is the first coordinate of the `j-th` sofa, `y1_j` is the second coordinate of the `j-th` sofa, `x2_j` is the third coordinate of the `j-th` sofa, `y2_j` is the fourth coordinate of the `j-th` sofa. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then the `i-th` element of `left_count` is incremented by 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged. The current value of `y1` is less than `y1_j` and the current value of `y2` is less than `y1_j`.**
