Postcondition: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the sofa at index 1 in the `sofas` list, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuple elements. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `left_count[1]` is the number of sofas to the left of the sofa at index 1 plus 1, and `left_count[k]` for `k` not equal to 1 is the number of sofas to the right of the corresponding sofa. In all cases, `top_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas below the corresponding sofa, `bottom_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas above the corresponding sofa, `right_count` is a list where each element is the number of sofas to the left of the corresponding sofa, and `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the sofa at index `j` in the `sofas` list. If `i` equals `j`, then `i` and `j` are both 0, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 0.**
