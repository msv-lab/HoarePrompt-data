The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, we will assume that this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop structure that is not shown here.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the values of the variables do not change because `continue` does not affect variable values directly; it only affects the flow of the loop. Therefore, the states of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is the first coordinate of the first input, `y1` is the second coordinate of the first input, `x2` is the third coordinate of the first input, `y2` is the fourth coordinate of the first input, `cntl` is the first input integer, `cntr` is the second input integer, `cntt` is the third input integer, `cntb` is the fourth input integer, `sofas` is a list containing at least one tuple element, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` may be updated, `y1_j` may be updated, `x2_j` may be updated, `y2_j` may be updated, `top_count` may be updated, `left_count` may be updated, `right_count` may be updated, `bottom_count` may be updated, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop**
