The code `sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))` adds a new tuple containing the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` to the end of the `sofas` list. 

The previous values of the variables are:
- `d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `x1` is an input integer between 1 and `n`
- `y1` is an input integer between 1 and `m`
- `x2` is an input integer between 1 and `n`
- `y2` is an input integer between 1 and `m`
- `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1
- `sofas` is an empty list

After the code is executed, `sofas` will contain one tuple element: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `y1` is an input integer between 1 and `m`, `x2` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `y2` is an input integer between 1 and `m`, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d` - 1, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple element: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`**
