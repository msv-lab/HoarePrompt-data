To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is designed to run `d` times, where `d` is an input integer between 1 and 10^5. In each iteration, it reads four integers (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) and appends them as a tuple to the `sofas` list.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

- `d` remains an integer between 1 and 10^5.
- `n` and `m` remain input integers, as they are not modified within the loop.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers from the latest input, constrained between 1 and `n` and between 1 and `m`, respectively.
- `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d - 1`. However, their values are not directly affected by the loop, as the loop does not modify these variables.
- `sofas` is a list that accumulates tuple elements `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` from each iteration.

Considering the loop will execute `d` times and the pattern observed from the output states after a few iterations, we can deduce the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

If `d` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `sofas` will remain an empty list. However, since `d` is specified to be between 1 and 10^5, this case is not applicable under the given constraints.

For any positive `d`, after the loop finishes, `sofas` will contain `d` tuple elements, each representing the input coordinates (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) from each iteration. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` will be those from the last input, as they are overwritten in each iteration.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`d` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the latest input integers between 1 and `n` and between 1 and `m` respectively, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `d - 1`, and `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuple elements, each representing the input coordinates from each iteration.**
