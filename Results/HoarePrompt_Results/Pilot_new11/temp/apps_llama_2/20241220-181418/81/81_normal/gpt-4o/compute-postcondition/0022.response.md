Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9 and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 4, `i` is 2, `a` is `2 * x`, `b` is at least `2 * x` and equals `(y // x) // 2 * x`. If `a` equals `b`, then `count` is increased by 1 from its previous state based on the fulfillment of the initial conditional statements regarding divisibility, range, and GCD of `x` and `y`. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 2 from its initial value.**
