Postcondition: ***`l`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9, `x`, `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` equals `y // x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3, `a` is `3 * x`, `b` equals `(y // (3 * x)) * x`, if `a` equals `b`, then `count` is increased by 1, otherwise `count` is increased by 2***
