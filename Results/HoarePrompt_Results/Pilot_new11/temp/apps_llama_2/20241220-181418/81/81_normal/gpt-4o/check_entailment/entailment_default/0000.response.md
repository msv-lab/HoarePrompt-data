Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the problem description. It first checks if `y` is divisible by `x` and returns 0 if not. Then it calculates the value of `z` as `y // x` and iterates over all possible divisors of `z`. For each divisor `i`, it calculates the corresponding values of `a` and `b` as `i * x` and `z // i * x`, respectively. It then checks if both `a` and `b` are within the given range `[l, r]` and if their GCD equals `x` and their LCM equals `y`. If both conditions are met, it increments the count by 1 if `a` equals `b` and by 2 if `a` is not equal to `b`.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of its functionality. The code handles all possible cases, including when `y` is not divisible by `x`, when `a` equals `b`, and when `a` is not equal to `b`. It also correctly counts the number of distinct pairs of numbers `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

The examples provided in the problem description also support the correctness of the code. For instance, when `l = 1`, `r = 2`, `x = 1`, and `y = 2`, the code correctly returns 2, which corresponds to the pairs `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`. Similarly, when `l = 1`, `r = 12`, `x = 1`, and `y = 12`, the code correctly returns 4, which corresponds to the pairs `(1, 12)`, `(12, 1)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(4, 3)`.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and handles all possible cases as described in the problem description.
