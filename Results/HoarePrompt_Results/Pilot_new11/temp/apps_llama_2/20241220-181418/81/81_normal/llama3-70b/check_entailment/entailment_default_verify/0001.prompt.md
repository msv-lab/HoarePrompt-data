You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. It only defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the GCD and LCM of two numbers, respectively. However, it does not contain any code to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible pairs of integers (a, b) in the range [l, r] and checking if their GCD is x and LCM is y. If such a pair is found, it should be counted.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: if we input l = 1, r = 10, x = 2, and y = 6, the program should return the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions. However, the given program does not contain any code to perform this calculation.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to add a function that takes the input values l, r, x, and y, and returns the count of good pairs. Here is a simple example of how this could be implemented:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)

def count_good_pairs(l, r, x, y):
    count = 0
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(l, r + 1):
            if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
                count += 1
    return count

l, r, x, y = map(int, input().split())
print(count_good_pairs(l, r, x, y))
```

This code defines a new function `count_good_pairs` that iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) in the range [l, r] and checks if their GCD is x and LCM is y. If such a pair is found, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of good pairs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers, and returns the integer result of `(a * b)` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero value to avoid division by zero errors. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` and `b`, and only returns the calculated result. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input parameters `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer value.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
