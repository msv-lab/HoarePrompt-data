Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The program is supposed to find the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts so that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square. However, the program only checks for one specific way of forming a rectangle, where two parts have length `a` and the other two parts have length `b = a` and `rem // 2`. 

It does not consider the case where two parts have length `a` and the other two parts have lengths `b` and `c` such that `a + b = c + d` (or any other combination of these lengths) which would also form a rectangle.

For example, when `n = 8`, the program returns `1` because it only finds the combination `{1, 1, 3, 3}`. However, there could be other combinations, such as `{2, 2, 2, 2}` which does not form a rectangle without forming a square and thus the program is not correct.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not cover all possible cases of forming a rectangle without forming a square. 

A correct program should consider all possible combinations of lengths that can form a rectangle without forming a square. 

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: `n = 10`. The correct output should be `2` because the stick can be cut into `{1, 1, 4, 4}` and `{2, 2, 3, 3}`. However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly. 

A correct approach would involve generating all possible combinations of four lengths that sum up to `n` and checking if they can form a rectangle without forming a square. 

Here is an example of a correct approach in Python:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - 2 * a) // 2 + 1):
            c = n - 2 * a - 2 * b
            if c >= 0:
                if (a == b and a!= c) or (a == c and a!= b) or (b == c and a!= b):
                    count += 1
    return count
```
