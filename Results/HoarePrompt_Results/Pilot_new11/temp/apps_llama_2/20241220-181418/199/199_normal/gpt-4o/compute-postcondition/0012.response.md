To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
```
The loop will execute again if `a` is less than `n // 4`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be incremented by 1, so `a` becomes 2.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, and `n // 4` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 8 (because 6 // 4 = 1 and 7 // 4 = 1, but 8 // 4 = 2).

The value of `b` remains unchanged as 1.

The value of `rem` is `n - 4`, and its parity (even or odd) and comparison with `a` determine the value of `count`. However, at the start of the next iteration, we only need to consider the updated value of `a` and its relation to `n` for the loop to continue. The specific conditions for `count` will be evaluated within the loop body based on the updated `a` and `rem`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
