The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on two cases: 
Case_1: The function returns 0. 
Case_2: The function returns the number of valid combinations where `n - 4a` is positive, even, and not equal to `2a`, for `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`, where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 0 or the number of valid combinations based on the given conditions.
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer parameter n and returns either 0 or the number of valid combinations where n - 4a is positive, even, and not equal to 2a, for a in the range from 1 to n // 4.**
