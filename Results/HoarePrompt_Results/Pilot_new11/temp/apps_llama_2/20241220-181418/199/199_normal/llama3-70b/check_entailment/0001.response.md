Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to split a stick into four parts of positive integer length such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Rectangle Formation**: For a rectangle to be formed, two pairs of parts must have the same length. The program iterates over all possible pairs of lengths `(a, b)` such that `a <= b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, which ensures that the sum of the lengths of the four parts equals `n`.

2. **Square Rejection**: The condition `a!= b` in the program ensures that the case where all four parts have the same length (i.e., a square) is rejected, as required by the problem description.

3. **Counting Distinct Ways**: The program counts the number of distinct ways to split the stick by iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and incrementing the `ways` counter whenever a valid pair is found. This approach correctly handles the case where two ways to cut the stick are considered distinct if there exists some integer `x` such that the number of parts of length `x` in the first way differs from the number of parts of length `x` in the second way.

The provided examples in the problem description also demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For `n = 6`, the program outputs `1`, which corresponds to the only way to divide the stick: `{1, 1, 2, 2}`.
- For `n = 20`, the program outputs `4`, which corresponds to the four ways to divide the stick: `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`.

After analyzing the program and the problem description, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
