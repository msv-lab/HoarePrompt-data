To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 2.

Given Code:
```python
rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
```

The code calculates the value of `rem` by subtracting twice the sum of `a` and `b` from `n`. 

Given `a` is 2 and `b` is 2, the sum of `a` and `b` is 4. Twice this sum is 8. 

So, `rem = n - 8`.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, subtracting 8 from `n` will result in `rem` being greater than or equal to 0.

The states of `n`, `a`, and `b` do not change as a result of this operation. Only a new variable `rem` is introduced, which is equal to `n - 8`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `rem` is `n - 8`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `rem` is `n - 8`.**
