Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I have analyzed the program's behavior and reasoning. 

The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it only checks for one specific way of forming a rectangle, where two parts have length `a` and the other two parts have length `b = a` and `rem // 2`. However, the output hints suggest that the function considers all potential edge cases and returns the count of valid combinations where `n - 4a` is positive, even, and not equal to `2a`, for `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`. 

Upon closer examination, the provided code actually implements the logic described in the output hints. It iterates over all possible values of `a` and checks if `n - 2 * (a + b)` is positive and even, and if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. This effectively counts the number of valid combinations where `n - 4a` is positive, even, and not equal to `2a`.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is not accurate. The program does implement the correct logic to solve the problem, and the output hints provide a correct description of the program's behavior.

The reason why the original assessment is not accurate is that it misunderstands the logic implemented in the code. The code does not only check for one specific way of forming a rectangle, but rather it checks all possible combinations where two parts have length `a` and the other two parts have length `b = rem // 2`, which is a necessary condition for forming a rectangle without forming a square.

Based on the analysis of the problem description, the program, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is actually correct.

Final: **True**
