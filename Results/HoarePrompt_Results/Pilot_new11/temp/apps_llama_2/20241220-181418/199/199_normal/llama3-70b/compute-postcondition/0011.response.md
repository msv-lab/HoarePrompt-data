Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3. If `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`, then if `n` equals 6, `ways` is 3, otherwise `ways` is 2. If the condition is not met, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, if `n` equals 6, `ways` is 2, otherwise `ways` is 1.***
