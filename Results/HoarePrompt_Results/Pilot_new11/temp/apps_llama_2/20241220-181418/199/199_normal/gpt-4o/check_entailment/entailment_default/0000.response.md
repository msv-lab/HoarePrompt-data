Correctness: **False**.

The code provided only checks for cases where two pairs of equal length parts can form a rectangle. However, it does not consider cases where two different pairs of equal length parts can form a rectangle. 

For example, when `n = 10`, the code does not count the combination `{1, 3, 3, 3}` where `1 + 3 = 3 + 3` and `1 + 3 = 4` (one side of the rectangle is formed by the part of length 1 and one part of length 3, and the other side is formed by the other two parts of length 3).

However, a more accurate example is if n is a odd number, say 9 or 15 or any odd number and the code will miss cases where there can be one odd number (length) and three even numbers such that sum of the two even numbers will be equal to the sum of the other even number and the odd number. For example if `n = 9`, one possible combination is `(1, 2, 2, 4)`, the code will not count such a combination.

Moreover, this problem requires all possible combinations of 4 parts, so it should have more variables not just `a` and `b = a` to find all the combinations, in order to form a rectangle we can have any combination of lengths where two pairs sum up to the same value and this does not need to be that a pair has equal lengths as in `a = b` case. 

In the case of `n = 6`, `a = 1` and `b = 2` with `c = 1` and `d = 2` can also form a rectangle where two pairs of sides sum up to the same value. 

Therefore, the provided code does not cover all cases and is incorrect.
