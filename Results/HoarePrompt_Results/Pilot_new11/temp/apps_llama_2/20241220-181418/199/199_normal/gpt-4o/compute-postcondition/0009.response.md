The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `a` is still 1, `b` is still 1, and `rem` is still an even number greater than 0, and `a` is not equal to half of the current value of `rem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `rem` is an even number greater than 0, and `a` is not equal to half of the current value of `rem`**
