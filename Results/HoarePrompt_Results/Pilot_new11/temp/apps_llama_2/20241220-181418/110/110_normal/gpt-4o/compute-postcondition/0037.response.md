The code calculates the `total_positions` as `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this calculation, and the previous values are still valid. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the original positive integer dimensions of the rectangular pond, `r` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is the original positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list with `n*m - k` tuples if `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n*m`, otherwise `heap` remains a list of `n*m` tuples, `total_coverage` is the sum of the `k` highest coverage values if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `total_coverage` is 0, and `total_positions` is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`**
