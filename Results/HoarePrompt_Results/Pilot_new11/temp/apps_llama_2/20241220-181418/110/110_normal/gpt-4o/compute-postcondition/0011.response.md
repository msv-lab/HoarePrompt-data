To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial conditions. The code snippet involves pushing an element onto a heap using `heapq.heappush()`. The element to be pushed is a tuple containing three values: the negative of the result of `coverage(x, y)`, and the values of `x` and `y` themselves.

Initially:
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than 1.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
- `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5.
- `heap` is a list of `m` tuples.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 0.

The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a tuple onto the heap. The first element of the tuple is `-coverage(x, y)`, where `x = 1` and `y = 0`. The function `coverage(x, y)` is not defined in the given problem, so we will leave its result as `coverage(1, 0)`.

After executing the code:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged.
- The value of `r` remains unchanged.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.
- The heap now contains an additional tuple: `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`.
- The value of `x` remains 1.
- The value of `y` remains 0.

Since `coverage(x, y)` is not defined and could potentially return any value, we cannot simplify the first element of the tuple further than `-coverage(1, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list of tuples including at least `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`, `x` is 1, `y` is 0**
