To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than 0
- `m` is a positive integer
- `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`
- `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5
- `heap` is an empty list
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0

And the code:
```python
heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
```

The `heapq.heappush` function adds an element to the heap. In this case, the element is a tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. The `coverage(x, y)` function is not defined in the provided context, so we'll treat its result as a value dependent on `x` and `y`.

Given `x` is 0 and `y` is 0, the tuple becomes `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`. The value of `coverage(0, 0)` is unknown without the definition of `coverage(x, y)`, but let's denote it as `c`. So, the tuple simplifies to `(-c, 0, 0)`.

The `heap` list, initially empty, now contains this tuple.

The states of `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state, considering the changes, is:
- `n` is a positive integer and greater than 0
- `m` is a positive integer
- `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`
- `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5
- `heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`, `k` is a positive integer and less than or equal to the minimum of the product of `n` and `m` and 10^5, `heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-coverage(0, 0), 0, 0)`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
