According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` string. If `ops` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the first character of `ops`. For the loop to execute one more time, `op` must be the second character of `ops`. Also, `ops` must have at least 2 characters.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `op` is the second character of `ops`**
