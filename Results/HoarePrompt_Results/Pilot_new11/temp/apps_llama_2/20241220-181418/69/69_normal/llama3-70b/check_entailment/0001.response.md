Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. 

One of the cases where the program does not work as expected is when the given sequence already leads the robot to a point that is not (x, y), but it is possible to change a subsegment of the sequence to reach (x, y). 

For example, consider the following input:
Input
5
RURUU
-2 1

The program will calculate the final position of the robot as (1, 2) and then try to adjust the sequence to reach (-2, 1). However, it does not consider the possibility of changing the subsegment to move the robot to (-2, 1) in the most efficient way.

In this case, the program should output 3 (by changing the sequence to LURUU), but it will output 5 because it will try to adjust the entire sequence.

The correct approach would be to consider all possible subsegments of the sequence and calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position (x, y). 

Here is a corrected version of the program in python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy) = (0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    if abs(x - ux) > n or abs(y - uy) > n:
        print(-1)
        return

    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
            for k in range(i, j + 1):
                if ops[k] == 'U' and dy < 0:
                    dx += 0
                    dy += 1
                elif ops[k] == 'U' and dy >= 0:
                    dx += 0
                    dy -= 1
                elif ops[k] == 'D' and dy > 0:
                    dx += 0
                    dy -= 1
                elif ops[k] == 'D' and dy <= 0:
                    dx += 0
                    dy += 1
                elif ops[k] == 'R' and dx < 0:
                    dx -= 1
                    dy += 0
                elif ops[k] == 'R' and dx >= 0:
                    dx += 1
                    dy += 0
                elif ops[k] == 'L' and dx > 0:
                    dx += 1
                    dy += 0
                elif ops[k] == 'L' and dx <= 0:
                    dx -= 1
                    dy += 0
            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                ans = min(ans, j - i + 1)
    if ans == n:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(ans)
