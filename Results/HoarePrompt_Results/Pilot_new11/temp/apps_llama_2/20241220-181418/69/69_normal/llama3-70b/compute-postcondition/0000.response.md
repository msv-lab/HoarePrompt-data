The code `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to an integer input by the user. The initial state of `n` being a positive integer is updated with a new value from the user input. The sequence, x, and y remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, the sequence is a string of n characters from 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and x and y are integers**
