Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to the length of `operations` after removal, `operations` is a string of length `n-1` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If `op` is 'D', then `y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'U', then `x` and `y` remain unchanged.***
