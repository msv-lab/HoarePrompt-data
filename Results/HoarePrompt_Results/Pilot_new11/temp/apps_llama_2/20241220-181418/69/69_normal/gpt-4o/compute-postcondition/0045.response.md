A dictionary `position_map` is created and initialized with the key `(0, 0)` and the value `-1`. This operation does not change the values of any existing variables, but adds a new variable `position_map` to the state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is positive infinity, `current_x` is 0, `current_y` is 0, `position_map` is {(0, 0): -1}, and either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both**
