Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, and we are at the next operation in the string. If the current operation `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is set to 1. Otherwise, `res` is incremented by 1.***
