The code `final_y -= 1` decreases the value of `final_y` by 1. However, the initial state does not mention `final_y`, it mentions `y`. Assuming the code is supposed to be `y -= 1` to match the given initial state, the impact of the code is that the value of `y` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to the length of `operations` after removal, `operations` is a string of length `n-1` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer decreased by 1, or `y` is `y - 1`**
