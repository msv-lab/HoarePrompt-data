Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'U', then `lx` is 0 and `ly` is 1. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'D', then `lx` is 0 and `ly` is -1, and `y` is decreased by 1. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'R', then `lx` is 1, `ly` is 0, and `ux` is incremented by 1. If the first character of the remaining `ops` is 'L', then `lx` is -1, `ly` is 0, and `ux` is decremented by 1 from its initially undefined state. For any other first character of the remaining `ops`, `lx` and `ly` remain unchanged from their initial values of 0, and `ux` remains in its initially undefined state if it was not 'R', otherwise it is incremented by 1.**
