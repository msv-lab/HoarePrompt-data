You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        target_pos = (current_x + dx, current_y + dy)
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly calculates the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed in the sequence of operations to move the robot from the origin to the target coordinates.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program first calculates the final position of the robot after executing the given sequence of operations. It then calculates the difference between the target position and the final position, which is the offset that needs to be covered by changing a subsegment of the operations sequence.

2. The program then iterates over the operations sequence and maintains a position map that stores the index of each visited position.

3. For each position, the program checks if there is a previous position that is the same as the current position plus the offset. If such a position is found, it calculates the length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position and updates the minimum length if necessary.

4. If no such position is found after iterating over the entire sequence, the program returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to reach the target position by changing a subsegment of the operations sequence.

The program correctly handles edge cases such as:

* If the target position is already reachable by the given sequence, the program returns 0, indicating that no changes are needed.
* If the target position is not reachable by changing a subsegment of the operations sequence, the program returns -1.

The examples provided in the problem description have been tested, and the program produces the correct output for each of them. After analyzing the program and testing it with various inputs, it appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
