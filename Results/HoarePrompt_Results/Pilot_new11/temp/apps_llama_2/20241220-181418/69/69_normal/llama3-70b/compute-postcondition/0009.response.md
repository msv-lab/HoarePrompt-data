The value of `uy` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `uy` was 0, so the new value of `uy` is -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user that must not be empty, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is 0, `uy` is -1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, and the first character of `ops`, denoted as `op`, is 'D'.
