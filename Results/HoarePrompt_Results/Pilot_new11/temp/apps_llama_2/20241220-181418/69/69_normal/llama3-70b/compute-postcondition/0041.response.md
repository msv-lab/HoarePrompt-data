The given code prints -1, which means it returns -1 as the output. The values of the variables do not change but the value -1 is returned as the output.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and the value -1 has been returned as the output, where the current value of `dx` is less than 0 or the current value of `dy` is less than 0**
