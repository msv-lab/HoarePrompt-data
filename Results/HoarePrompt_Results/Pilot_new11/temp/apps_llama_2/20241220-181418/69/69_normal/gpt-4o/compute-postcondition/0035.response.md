Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to the length of `operations` after one more removal, `operations` is a string of length `n-1` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are integers. If `op` is 'U', then `final_y` is `final_y + 1`. If `op` is 'D', then `y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is increased by 1.***
