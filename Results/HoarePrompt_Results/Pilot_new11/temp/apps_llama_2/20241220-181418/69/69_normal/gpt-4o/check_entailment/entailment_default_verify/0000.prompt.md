You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        target_pos = (current_x + dx, current_y + dy)
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not work correctly for all cases. One potential issue with this code is that it does not correctly handle the case when the target position is not reachable by changing a subsegment of the given sequence of operations.

For instance, consider the case where the given sequence of operations is "UUUU" and the target position is (100, 100). The code will return -1, which is correct. However, it does not handle the case when the target position is not reachable by changing a subsegment of the given sequence of operations, such as the case where the target position is (1, 1) and the given sequence of operations is "UUUUUU". 

Another potential issue with this code is that it does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. The code calculates the minimum length by subtracting the position of the previous occurrence of the target position from the current position. However, this does not guarantee the minimum length, especially when the target position occurs multiple times in the sequence of operations.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as using a dynamic programming or a sliding window approach to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. 

The given code has a bug in the way it handles the position_map dictionary. The keys in the dictionary should be tuples of two integers (x, y), but in the line where we update the position_map, we are using `(current_x, current_y)` instead of `(current_x, current_y)`. 

However, the given program does not seem to have a clear logical error in the algorithm that handles all the given examples, so the code should be able to be fixed with minor adjustments to handle these edge cases.

Here is a sample case that demonstrates the bug:

Input:
```
6
UUUUUU
1 1
```
Output:
```
-1
```
This case should return 1 because we can change the first 'U' to 'R' to reach the target position (1,1). However, the given program returns -1, which is incorrect. 

The correct approach to solve this problem would involve finding the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position. This can be done by iterating over all possible subsegments of the given sequence of operations and checking if changing that subsegment can lead to the target position. 

Here is a correct Python solution for the problem:

```python
def min_length(n, operations, x, y):
    min_length = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            for dx in range(-1, 2):
                for dy in range(-1, 2):
                    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                        continue
                    new_x = 0
                    new_y = 0
                    for k in range(n):
                        if k >= i and k <= j:
                            if dx == -1:
                                new_x -= 1
                            elif dx == 1:
                                new_x += 1
                        else:
                            if operations[k] == 'U':
                                new_y += 1
                            elif operations[k] == 'D':
                                new_y -= 1
                            elif operations[k] == 'L':
                                new_x -= 1
                            elif operations[k] == 'R':
                                new_x += 1
                    if new_x == x and new_y == y:
                        min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)
    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else -1
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the sequence of operations. It iterates over all possible subsegments of the sequence and checks if changing that subsegment can lead to the target position. If a subsegment is found that can lead to the target position, it updates the minimum length. If no such subsegment is found, it returns -1.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` calculates and returns the minimum distance between revisits to a target position determined by the given parameters `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. It accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `operations` (a string of length `n` with characters 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'), and `x` and `y` (integers). The function first calculates the final position (`final_x` and `final_y`) after all operations in `operations` are executed. If this final position matches the target position (`x`, `y`), the function returns
