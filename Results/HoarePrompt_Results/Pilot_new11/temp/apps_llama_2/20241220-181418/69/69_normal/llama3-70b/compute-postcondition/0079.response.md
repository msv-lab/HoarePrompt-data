Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is updated based on the last operation, `uy` is updated based on the last operation, and we are at the next operation in the string. If the current operation `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decreased by 1 from its previous value. Otherwise, if the current operation `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is set to 1, otherwise `res` is incremented by 1.**
