To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ops` is a string input by the user.
- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `lx` is 0.
- `ly` is 0.
- `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`.
- `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`.

The given code is:
```python
dx, dy = x - ux, y - uy
```
This code introduces two new variables, `dx` and `dy`, and assigns them values based on the existing variables `x`, `y`, `ux`, and `uy`.

Given the initial state and the code, we can determine that:
- `dx` is assigned the value of `x - ux`.
- `dy` is assigned the value of `y - uy`.
- The values of `n`, `ops`, `x`, `y`, `lx`, `ly`, `ux`, and `uy` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them.

Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables with their unchanged values and the two new variables `dx` and `dy` with their assigned values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`**
