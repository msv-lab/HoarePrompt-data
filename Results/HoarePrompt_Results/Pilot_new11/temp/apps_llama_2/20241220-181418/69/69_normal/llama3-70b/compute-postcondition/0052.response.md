The value of `dx` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `dx` was greater than 0, so the new value of `dx` is `dx - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a non-empty string input by the user, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `ux` is the difference between the number of 'R' and 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the difference between the number of 'U' and 'D' operations in `ops`, `dx` is `x - ux - 1`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, `res` is 0, `op` is 'R', and `dx` is greater than or equal to 0 but less than its previous value**
