Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description asks to find the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap. This implies that we should consider all possible swaps, including swapping any two characters (not necessarily adjacent) in the string.

However, the provided program only considers swapping a 'G' followed by an 'S' with the next character. It does not consider other possible swaps, such as swapping two 'S' characters or a 'G' character at an arbitrary position with an 'S' character.

Therefore, the program may not find the optimal solution for all possible input cases.

For example, if the input string is 'SGGGGG', the program will not consider swapping the 'S' at the beginning with the last 'G', which would result in the string 'GGGGGS' and have a maximum beauty of 5.

To solve this problem correctly, we would need to consider all possible swaps and keep track of the maximum beauty achieved. Here is a correct example of how the function could be implemented:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            temp = list(s)
            temp[i], temp[j] = temp[j], temp[i]
            temp = ''.join(temp)
            curr_beauty = 0
            max_curr_beauty = 0
            for k in range(n):
                if temp[k] == 'G':
                    curr_beauty += 1
                    max_curr_beauty = max(max_curr_beauty, curr_beauty)
                else:
                    curr_beauty = 0
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, max_curr_beauty)
    
    # calculate the maximum beauty without swap
    curr_beauty = 0
    max_curr_beauty = 0
    for k in range(n):
        if s[k] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
            max_curr_beauty = max(max_curr_beauty, curr_beauty)
        else:
            curr_beauty = 0
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, max_curr_beauty)
    
    print(max_beauty)
```

This corrected version of the function considers all possible swaps and calculates the maximum beauty achieved for each swap, including the case where no swap is made. It then prints the maximum beauty achieved among all these cases.
