To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down what the loop does and analyze the provided output states for patterns or clues.

1. **Loop Functionality**: The loop iterates backwards from the index `i-1` down to `0`. For each index `j` in this range, it checks if the character at `s[j]` is 'G'. If it is, it increments the `beauty` counter by 1. If it encounters an 'S', it breaks out of the loop.

2. **Output State Analysis**: 
    - After the loop executes 1 time, if the character before `i` is 'G', `beauty` is 2; otherwise, it remains 1, and the loop breaks.
    - After the loop executes 2 times, if the character at `i-2` is 'G', `beauty` increases; otherwise, the loop breaks.
    - This pattern continues, indicating that `beauty` will keep increasing as long as it finds 'G's before the current index `i`.

3. **Determining Final Output State**:
    - The loop will execute as long as `j` (which starts at `i-1` and decrements) is greater than or equal to 0. This means it will scan all characters to the left of `i` until it either finds an 'S' or reaches the beginning of the string.
    - `beauty` starts at 1 (because the character at index `i` is 'G') and increases by 1 for each 'G' it finds to the left of `i` until it hits an 'S' or the start of the string.
    - Other variables like `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` do not change within this loop. Their values remain as they were before the loop started.

Given this analysis, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be:

- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` remain unchanged within this loop, but their original purpose and how they might change in the broader context of the program are not specified in the given loop.
- `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and will be the same as it was at the start of the loop since it does not change within the loop.
- `beauty` will be equal to the number of consecutive 'G's to the right of the first 'S' encountered when scanning from `i` backwards towards the start of `s`, plus 1 (for the 'G' at index `i` itself).

Considering these points, the output state of the loop can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered plus 1.**
