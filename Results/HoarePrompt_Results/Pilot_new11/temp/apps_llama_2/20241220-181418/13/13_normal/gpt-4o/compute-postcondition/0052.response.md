The values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` are updated to the start and end indices of the sequence of 'G' at index `i` in `segments`. Since `i` is 1, `curr_start` and `curr_end` are assigned the values of `segments[1][0]` and `segments[1][1]`, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `max_length` equals `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, `prev_start` equals `segments[0][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[0][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[1][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[1][1]`.**
