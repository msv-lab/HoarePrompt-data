Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully address the problem description. It only considers swapping a 'G' trophy followed by an 'S' trophy, but it does not consider all possible swaps of two trophies that could lead to a longer sequence of 'G' trophies.

For example, consider the input sequence "SGGGSG". The code will not consider swapping the first 'S' trophy with the last 'S' trophy, which would result in the sequence "GGGGGG" with a maximum beauty of 6. Instead, the code will only consider swapping the 'G' trophy followed by an 'S' trophy, which would not lead to the optimal solution.

To fix this, the code should consider all possible swaps of two trophies and calculate the maximum beauty achievable for each swap. This would ensure that the code fully addresses the problem description and produces the correct output for all possible input cases.
