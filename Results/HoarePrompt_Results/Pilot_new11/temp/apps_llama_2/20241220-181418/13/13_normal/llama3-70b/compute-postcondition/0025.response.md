To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S',
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `right` is incremented by 1.

The code provided is:
```python
max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
```

From this, we can infer that:
- The value of `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, and the fact that `right` is incremented by 1 are not affected by this line of code.

Since `right` is mentioned as "incremented by 1" in the initial state but not directly in the code provided, we must consider the context in which this code is executed. However, without explicit code showing the increment of `right`, we cannot conclude its current value beyond what's initially stated.

Given that `max_beauty` is now the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, and without knowing the exact values of `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` beforehand, we can only state that `max_beauty` has been updated to this maximum value.

Therefore, the output state, considering the information provided and the effect of the code, is:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S',
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `right` is incremented by 1 (its current value is not explicitly stated but implied to be one more than its value before the increment),
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is incremented by 1, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`.**
