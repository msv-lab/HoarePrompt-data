Postcondition: ***`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `prev_start` equals `segments[1][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[1][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[2][1]`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. If `curr_start - prev_end` is not equal to 2, then the state remains unchanged.***
