The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `beauty` depends on the character at position `j` in string `s` and whether we have broken out of the loop. If the character at position `j` is 'G', then `beauty` was 3. If we haven't broken out of the loop and the character at position `j` is not 'G', then `beauty` was 2. If we have broken out of the loop because `s[j]` is not 'G', then `beauty` was 1. After incrementing by 1, the value of `beauty` becomes 4, 3, or 2 respectively.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 4, otherwise, if we haven't broken out of the loop, then `beauty` is 3, but if we have broken out of the loop because `s[j]` is not 'G', then `beauty` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 4, otherwise, if we haven't broken out of the loop, then `beauty` is 3, but if we have broken out of the loop because `s[j]` is not 'G', then `beauty` is 2**
