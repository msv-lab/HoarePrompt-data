The function `func` accepts no arguments but operates on two input variables: an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^5) and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. However, since the function itself does not directly accept these parameters, we consider the functionality in the context of the program's input variables. The return value is not specified in the problem statement. 

Given the lack of specific return conditions in the provided problem statement, we cannot describe the exact return behavior of the function. Normally, we would outline the return values based on conditions such as the content of the string or the value of `n`, but without this information, we can only state that the function operates on the given input variables.

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5) and a string of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, but the specific return values or behavior are not defined.**
