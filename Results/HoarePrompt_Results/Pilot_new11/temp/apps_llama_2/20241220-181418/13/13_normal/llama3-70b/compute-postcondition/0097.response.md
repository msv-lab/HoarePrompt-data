The `break` statement terminates the loop or conditional statement that it is directly inside of. In this case, since there is no specific loop or conditional statement provided in the code snippet, we will assume that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.

The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program is affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `beauty` is 1, `j` is `i - 1`, the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
