The `break` statement breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that the code is directly inside. The values of the variables `n`, `s`, `golden`, `i`, and `j` are not changed by this statement. The conditions that `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is `i - 3` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
