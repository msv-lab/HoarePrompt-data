To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

1. The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 2, n):`, which means `j` will take on the value of `i + 2` in the first iteration, and then increment by 1 in each subsequent iteration until it reaches `n - 1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was such that `s[j]` is 'S', and we broke out of the most internal loop.
3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` starts at `i + 2`, for the next iteration, `j` should be `i + 3`.
4. Given that `j` is now `i + 3`, the character at this new index in string `s` could be either 'G' or 'S'.
5. The value of `beauty` and the number of consecutive 'G's when moving backwards from `i - 1` would depend on the characters in `s` but would not directly affect the loop condition.
6. The condition that `n` must be at least `i + 2` for the loop to have started still applies, but now since `j` moves forward, `n` must be at least `i + 3` for the loop to continue.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time would be:

- `j` increments by 1, so if it was `i + 2`, it becomes `i + 3`.
- `n` must still be at least `i + 3` for the loop to execute again.
- The specifics of `beauty` and the counts of consecutive 'G's will change based on the new position of `j` and the contents of `s`, but these do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least `i + 3`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i + 3`**
