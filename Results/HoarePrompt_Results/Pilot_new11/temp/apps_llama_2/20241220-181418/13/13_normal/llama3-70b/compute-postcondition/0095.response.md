The code increments the value of `beauty` by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is 1, so the new value will be 1 + 1 = 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `beauty` is 2, `j` is `i - 1`, and the current value of `s` at index `j` is 'G'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `beauty` is 2, `j` is `i - 1`, and the current value of `s` at index `j` is 'G'**
