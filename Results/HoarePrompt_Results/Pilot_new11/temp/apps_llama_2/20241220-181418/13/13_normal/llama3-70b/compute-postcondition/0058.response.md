The code `beauty = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `beauty`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S', `beauty` is 1.
