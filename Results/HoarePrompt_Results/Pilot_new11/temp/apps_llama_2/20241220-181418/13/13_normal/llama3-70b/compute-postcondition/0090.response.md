Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`. If `s` at index 0 is 'G' and `s` at index 1 is 'S', then `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of 0 and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered, plus the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` to the point where the loop breaks. Otherwise, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains 0. In both cases, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`.***
