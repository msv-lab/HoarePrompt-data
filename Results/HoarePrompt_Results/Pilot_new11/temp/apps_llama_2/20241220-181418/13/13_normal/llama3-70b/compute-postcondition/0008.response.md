The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is `curr_beauty + 1` which is 1, `left` is 0, the current value of `right` is such that the character at index `right` in `s` is 'G'.
