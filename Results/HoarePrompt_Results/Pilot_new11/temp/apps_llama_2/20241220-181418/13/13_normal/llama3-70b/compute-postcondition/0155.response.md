Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least `i + 4`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i + 4`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is `beauty + 1`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
