The code increments `curr_beauty` by 1. The values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `right` are not affected. The value of `left` is still either the index of the first 'G' in `s` or equals `right`, and it is less than `right`.

Output State: **`n` retains its initial value, `s` retains its initial value, `golden` retains its initial value, `max_beauty` retains its initial value, `curr_beauty` is increased by 1, `right` retains its initial value, `left` is either the index of the first 'G' in `s` or equals `right` and is less than `right`**
