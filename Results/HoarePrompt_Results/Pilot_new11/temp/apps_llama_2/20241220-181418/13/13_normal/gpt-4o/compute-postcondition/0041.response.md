Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'. If `trophies[0]` is 'G', then `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, and if `trophies[0]` is 'S', then `i` is either 1, 2 or 3 and `n` must be greater than 1. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `i` equals the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` or equals `n` if all characters are 'G', `start` equals `i + 1`, and `segments` contains the tuple `(start, i - 1)`. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', then `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `trophies` previously had 'S' at its `i-1` index, and `i` must be less than `n`. Additionally, the character at index `i-1` in `trophies` is 'S'***
