Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `right` is incremented by 1 and `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. If `s[right]` is not 'G', then `left` and `right` have their initial values, and if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is increased by 1, otherwise `curr_beauty` remains unchanged.**
