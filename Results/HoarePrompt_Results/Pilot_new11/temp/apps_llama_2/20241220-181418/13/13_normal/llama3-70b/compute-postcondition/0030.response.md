The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was less than `right`, so the new value of `left` is either less than `right` or equal to `right`. The state of the other variables remains the same, but we must consider the case where `left` is now equal to `right`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is greater than or equal to `left`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` is `left + 1`.**
