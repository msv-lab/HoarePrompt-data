Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 1`. If the character at index `j` in `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2. If the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', then `beauty` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
