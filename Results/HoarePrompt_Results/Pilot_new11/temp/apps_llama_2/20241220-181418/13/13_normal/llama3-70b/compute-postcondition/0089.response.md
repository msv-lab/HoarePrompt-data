The given Python code updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

The updated value of `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value (0) and `beauty`, which is the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered, plus the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` to the point where the loop breaks.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), 
`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', 
`golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, 
`max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, 
`max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of 0 and `beauty`, 
`i` is greater than or equal to 0, 
the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' if the loop executed, 
`j` is `n`, and 
`beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered, plus the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` to the point where the loop breaks.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of 0 and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' if the loop executed, `j` is `n`, and `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered, plus the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` to the point where the loop breaks.**
