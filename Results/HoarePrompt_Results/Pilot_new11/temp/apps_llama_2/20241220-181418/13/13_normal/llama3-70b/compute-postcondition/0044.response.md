To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `left < right and s[left]!= 'G'`.

1. **Condition 1: `left < right`**  
   At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is equal to its initial value plus 1, and `left` is less than or equal to the initial value of `right`. Also, `right` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `left` must still be less than `right`. Given that `right` has been incremented, this condition is likely to hold true unless `left` and `right` were equal before the increment of `right`, in which case `left` needs to be less than the new value of `right` for the loop to continue. However, since `left` is also incremented by 1 implicitly as it is "equal to its initial value plus 1", and considering the loop's body increments `left` under certain conditions, we need to ensure that even with this increment, `left` remains less than `right`.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left]!= 'G'`**  
   For the loop to execute again, the character at the index `left` in string `s` must not be 'G'. Given that `left` is not in `golden` unless the increment made it equal to a value in `golden`, we need to ensure that after any increments, `left` does not point to a 'G' character in `s` for the loop to continue. This implies that if the increment of `left` could potentially make it point to a 'G', then we must adjust our understanding to ensure `s[left]` remains 'S' for the loop to execute again.

Considering these conditions:

- `n` being an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) does not directly influence whether the loop can execute again but sets the context for the string `s` and the lists of indices.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. Its state does not need adjustment for the loop to continue, as it is a constant within the loop's context.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`. Like `s`, it does not need adjustment for the loop to continue, as it is determined by `s`.
- For `left` to be less than `right` and considering `left` is incremented, we need to ensure `right` is greater than the new value of `left`. Given `right` is incremented, this condition seems maintainable.
- The critical aspect is ensuring `s[left]!= 'G'`. If `left`'s increment could make it equal to a value in `golden`, then for the loop to execute again, we must consider that `left` should not point to a 'G' after its increment, unless it's an unavoidable situation due to the string's composition.

Given these considerations, the state needs to reflect that `left` and `right` are positioned such that `left < right`, and ideally, `s[left]` should not be 'G' for the loop to execute again. However, since `left` is incremented and its relation to `golden` is dynamic, the focus should be on ensuring `left` does not necessarily point to a 'G' unless it's a scenario where `left` equals a value in `golden` due to its increment.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `left` is equal to its initial value plus 1 and is less than `right`, `right` is incremented by 1, `left` is not in `golden` unless its increment makes it equal to a value in `golden`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0**
