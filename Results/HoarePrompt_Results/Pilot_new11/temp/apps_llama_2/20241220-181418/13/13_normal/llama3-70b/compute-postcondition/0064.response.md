Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and the current value of `s` at index `i + 1` is 'S`, `j` is `i - 1`, if the current value of `s` at index `j` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2, otherwise `beauty` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S'.**
