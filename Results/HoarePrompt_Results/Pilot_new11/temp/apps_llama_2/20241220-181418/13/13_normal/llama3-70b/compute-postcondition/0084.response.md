According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 3`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is `i + 4`. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 3`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', `j` is `i + 4`**
