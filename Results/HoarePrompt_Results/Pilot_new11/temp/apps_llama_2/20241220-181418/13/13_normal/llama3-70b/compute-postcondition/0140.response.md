Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, if the character at the position `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 4, otherwise, `beauty` is 3 if we haven't broken out of the loop because `s[j]` is 'S' and we are still inside the loop, `beauty` is 2 if we have broken out of the loop because `s[j]` is not 'G' and we were inside the if condition, or `beauty` is 1 if we have broken out of the loop because `s[j]` is not 'G' and the if condition was not met and we broke out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
