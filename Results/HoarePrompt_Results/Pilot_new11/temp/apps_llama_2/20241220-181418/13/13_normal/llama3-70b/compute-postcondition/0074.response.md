To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given states:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0
- `i` is greater than or equal to 0
- The current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G'
- `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered plus 1

The loop statement is: `for j in range(i + 2, n):`

For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `i + 2` must be less than or equal to `n` because `range()` in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value. This implies `i` must be less than `n - 2` (or `n - 2 >= i`) for the loop to have at least one iteration.
2. Since `i` is at least 0 and `s` at index `i` is 'G', and considering the conditions for `n` and `s`, `n` must be at least 3 to ensure `i + 2` is within the bounds of `s`'s length when `i` is 0.
3. The initial value of `j` will be `i + 2`, which means we are starting the loop from the third character after `i`.
4. Other variables (`golden`, `max_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `beauty`) are part of the program state but are not directly influenced by the loop's initialization conditions based on the given loop statement.

Therefore, considering these conditions, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive) because we need at least 3 elements for i, i+1, and i+2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G', `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered plus 1, `j` is `i + 2`**
