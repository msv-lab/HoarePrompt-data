Based on the given code and the output states after the loop executes some number of times, we can analyze the behavior of the loop.

The loop continues to execute as long as `left` is less than `right` and the character at the `left` index in the string `s` is not 'G'.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see that `left` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `right` is also incremented by 1.

The loop will terminate when `left` is no longer less than `right` or when the character at the `left` index in the string `s` is 'G'.

At the end of the loop, `left` will be equal to the index of the first 'G' character in the string `s` starting from the initial value of `left`, or it will be equal to `right` if no 'G' character is found.

The values of `n`, `s`, and `golden` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

The values of `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` also remain unchanged, as they are not updated within the loop.

Therefore, the output state after all the iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `left` is the index of the first 'G' character in `s` starting from the initial value of `left`, or `left` is equal to `right` if no 'G' character is found, `right` is incremented by the number of iterations, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and 0**
