To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop statement:

- The loop continues as long as two conditions are met: `left < right` and `s[left]!= 'G'`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is 0.
- `curr_beauty` is 0.
- `left` is `left + 1`, implying `left` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `right` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'.

For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions `left < right` and `s[left]!= 'G'` must be satisfied.

1. **`left < right`**: Since `left` has been incremented by 1, to ensure `left` is still less than `right`, no additional adjustments to `left` and `right` are strictly necessary based on this condition alone because their relative positions are already defined by the previous iteration's outcome and the loop condition. However, we need to consider the impact of `s[left]!= 'G'`.

2. **`s[left]!= 'G'`**: Given that `left` has been incremented and the loop requires `s[left]` not to be 'G', we need to ensure that the character at the new `left` index is 'S'. This condition does not directly require adjustments to `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, or `curr_beauty`, but it implies that the string `s` should have at least one more 'S' at the position that `left` points to after its incrementation.

Given these conditions, the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time are focused on ensuring that `left` is still less than `right` and that `s[left]` is 'S' after the increment of `left`. The fact that `right` is greater than 0 and the character at `right` is 'S' is already given, so no adjustment is needed for `right` or the character at `right`. The value of `n`, the composition of `s`, and the list `golden` do not need direct adjustments for the loop to potentially execute again, as these are predetermined by the problem setup. `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` being 0 do not impact the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, based on the provided conditions and without making additional assumptions, focus on the relationship between `left` and `right` and the character at the new `left` position:

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` has been incremented and is less than `right`, and the character at the new index `left` in string `s` is 'S'**
