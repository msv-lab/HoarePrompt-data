The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1` = 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` with the second character being 'G', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `start` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` with the second character being 'G', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `start` is 0**
