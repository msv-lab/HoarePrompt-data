Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 4`, `j` is `i + 4`. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
