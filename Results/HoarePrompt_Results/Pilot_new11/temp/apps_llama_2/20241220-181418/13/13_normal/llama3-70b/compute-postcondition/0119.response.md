The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `beauty` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 4`, `j` is `i + 4`, and `beauty` is increased by 1.
