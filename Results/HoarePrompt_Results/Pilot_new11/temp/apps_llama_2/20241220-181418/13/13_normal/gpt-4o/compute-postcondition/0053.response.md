Postcondition: **`n` equals its original value, `trophies` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices for all sequences of 'G' in the original `trophies` string, `max_length` equals `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`, `prev_start` equals `segments[0][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[0][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[1][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[1][1]`. The current value of `curr_start` and `prev_end` is such that `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, indicating the distance between the end of the previous sequence of 'G' and the start of the current sequence of 'G' is 2.**
