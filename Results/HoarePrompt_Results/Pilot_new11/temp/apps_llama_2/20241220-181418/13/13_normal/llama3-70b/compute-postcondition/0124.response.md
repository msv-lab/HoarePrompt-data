Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `j` is the index of the last character that was processed in the loop, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, where `beauty` is the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, plus the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i + 2` to the right until an 'S' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If `s[i]` is not 'G' or `s[i + 1]` is not 'S', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
