Based on the provided information and the loop code, we can analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

The loop code is designed to iterate over the string `s` from index `i + 2` to the end of the string `n`. It increments the `beauty` variable whenever it encounters a 'G' character and breaks out of the loop when it encounters an 'S' character.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

* `n` remains unchanged as an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
* `s` remains unchanged as a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
* `golden` remains unchanged as a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
* `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` are not modified within this loop, so their values remain the same.
* `i` is the index of the current 'G' character being processed.
* `j` takes on values from `i + 2` to `n`.
* `beauty` is incremented by 1 for each consecutive 'G' character encountered starting from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered, plus the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` to the current index `j`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions will be true:

* If the loop executes at least once, `i` must be less than `n - 2`, and the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G'.
* The loop will break out of the inner loop when it encounters an 'S' character or reaches the end of the string `n`.
* `j` will take on the value of `n` after the loop finishes, indicating that it has iterated over the entire range.
* `beauty` will be equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered, plus the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` to the point where the loop breaks (either an 'S' character or the end of the string).

Considering these patterns and conditions, we can determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is less than 3 or the current value of `s` at index `i` is not 'G'), the variables will retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' if the loop executed, `j` is `n`, and `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` backwards to the first 'S' encountered, plus the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i` to the point where the loop breaks.**
