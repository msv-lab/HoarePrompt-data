According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `right` is at some value. For the loop to execute again, `right` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `right`.
State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is incremented by 1**
