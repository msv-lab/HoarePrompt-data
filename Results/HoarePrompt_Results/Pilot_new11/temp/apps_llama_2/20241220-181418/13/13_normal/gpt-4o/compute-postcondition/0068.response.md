The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'G' and 'S'. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following conditions: 
Case_1: The program returns 0; 
Case_2: The program returns the length of the only sequence of 'G' in the `trophies` string; 
Case_3: The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of any sequence of 'G' in `trophies` plus one, and the original value of `n`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', and return a value based on the sequences of 'G' in `trophies` and the value of `n`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and trophies, where n is the length of the trophies string, and returns a value based on the sequences of 'G' in the trophies string and the value of n.**
