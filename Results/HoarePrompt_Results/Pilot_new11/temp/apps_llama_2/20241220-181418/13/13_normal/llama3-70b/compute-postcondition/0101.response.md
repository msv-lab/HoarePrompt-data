The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. This statement does not affect the values of any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
