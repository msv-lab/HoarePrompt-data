The value of `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is still a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is still greater than or equal to 1, `j` is still the index of the last character that was processed in the loop, and `beauty` is still the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, plus the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i + 2` to the right until an 'S' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is the index of the last character that was processed in the loop, `beauty` is the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, plus the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i + 2` to the right until an 'S' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`**.
