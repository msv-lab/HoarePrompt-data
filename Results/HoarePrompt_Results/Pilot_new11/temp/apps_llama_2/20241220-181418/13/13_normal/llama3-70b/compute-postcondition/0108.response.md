According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `n` is greater than `i + 2`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute, `j` should start at `i + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. Since `n` must be greater than `i + 1` and the loop starts at `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2` - 1, meaning `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. Also, since `i` is greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `beauty` is 1 plus the number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached**
