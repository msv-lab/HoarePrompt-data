To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the output states after the first few iterations.

The loop code increments `beauty` by 1 for each 'G' character encountered in the substring of `s` from index `i + 2` to the right until an 'S' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached.

From the output states after the first few iterations, we can see that:

* `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
* `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
* `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
* `i` remains greater than or equal to 1
* `j` takes on the value of `i + 2`, `i + 3`, `i + 4`, and so on, until the loop terminates
* `beauty` is incremented by 1 for each 'G' character encountered in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, and then further incremented by 1 for each 'G' character encountered in the substring of `s` from index `i + 2` to the right until an 'S' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that after all iterations of the loop have finished:

* `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
* `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
* `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
* `i` is greater than or equal to 1
* `j` is the index of the last character that was processed in the loop, which is the minimum of `n` and `i + 2` plus the number of 'G' characters encountered in the substring of `s` from index `i + 2` to the right
* `beauty` is the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, plus the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i + 2` to the right until an 'S' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is less than or equal to `i + 1`), then `beauty` remains 1 plus the number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, and `j` is not defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is the index of the last character that was processed in the loop, `beauty` is the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i - 1` to the left until an 'S' character is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached, plus the total number of 'G' characters in the substring of `s` from index `i + 2` to the right until an 'S' character is encountered or the end of the string is reached.**
