According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals `n`, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals `n` and `a[1:]` holds the array elements `a_i` where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is max(0, `a[1] - n - 1`), `i` is 2**
