The code initializes a variable `max_erase` to 0. The values of `n` and `a` are not changed by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals `n` and `a[1:]` holds the array elements `a_i` where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^3, `max_erase` is 0**
