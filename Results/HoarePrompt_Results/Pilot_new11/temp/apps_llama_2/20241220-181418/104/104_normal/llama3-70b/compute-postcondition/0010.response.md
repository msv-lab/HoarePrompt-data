Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_1` < `a_2` <... < `a_n` <= 10^3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `n`. If all elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` are consecutive integers, then `max_erase` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `max_erase` is not modified.**
