You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
    print(max_erase)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The given program only checks for sequences where the difference between consecutive numbers is 1, but it does not consider other possible sequences where the difference between consecutive numbers is more than 1. This results in incorrect output for some test cases.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1 3 5 7
```
The program will output `0`, but the correct output should be `2`, because the numbers 3 and 5 can be erased, leaving the array `[1, _, _, 7]`, which can still be restored.

In this case, the program does not work correctly because it only checks for sequences with a difference of 1 between consecutive numbers, but it does not consider sequences with a difference of 2 or more. This results in an incorrect output, and therefore, the Correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit arguments, but it is implied that it will read from standard input, where the first line is a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and the second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_1 < a_2 <... < a_n <= 10^3).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), `max_erase` is the length of the longest consecutive subsequence in `a` minus one.
    print(max_erase)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
