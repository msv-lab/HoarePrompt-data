The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings separated by whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the integers in a list `a`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and the rest of the input represents the array elements `a_i`, we can assume that the input will be in the format `n a_1 a_2... a_n`. However, the given code does not explicitly read `n`, so we'll consider that `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100 and `a` will hold all the input integers including `n`.

Given this understanding, `a` will be a list of integers where the first element is `n` (due to the nature of the input and the code provided) and the rest are the array elements `a_i`. Therefore, `a[0]` equals `n`, and `a[1:]` will hold the array elements `a_i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` equals `n` and `a[1:]` holds the array elements `a_i` where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^3**.
