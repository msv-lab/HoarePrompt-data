Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 101 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^3\), `i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is an integer starting from `i + 2`. If the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` is constant and equal to 1, then `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `j - i - 1`.***
