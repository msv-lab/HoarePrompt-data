To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `n` is 1, then `res` is 1 because `n` is a square of `i` and `n` is a multiple of `i`.
- If `n` is not 1, then there is no update on `res`, and the original condition still holds: if `n` is a multiple of `i`, then `res` is 2.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `i` is currently 1, to execute the loop again, `i` should become 2.

Given that `i` needs to increment by 1 to move to the next iteration, we check the conditions that allow the loop to continue:
- `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` to ensure the loop can execute again.
- Since `i` is now 2, for `res` to be updated (if it is updated based on the conditions provided), we need to consider the cases:
  - If `n` is a square of `i` (now 2), which means `n` equals 4, then `res` could potentially be updated based on the loop body logic (not shown).
  - If `n` is a multiple of `i` (now 2), then `res` is 2, according to the condition provided for when `n` is not 1.

Thus, considering the increment of `i` and the conditions for `n` and `res`, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time would be:
- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 but must be such that `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 2 for the loop to continue, implying `n` must be greater than 4 for `i` to reach 3, but since we're only considering the step from `i=1` to `i=2`, `n` just needs to satisfy `int(n ** 0.5) + 1 > 2`.
- `i` becomes 2.
- If `n` equals 4 (because 2 squared is 4), then `res` could be updated according to the loop body (not specified). If `n` is a multiple of 2 but not 4 (since we're considering `i=2` now), `res` is 2 based on the provided conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, if `n` is a multiple of `i` (2), then `res` is 2, otherwise `res` update depends on the loop body logic not provided**
