The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `res` is `n + 2` if `n` is divisible by `i`. Therefore, the new value of `res` is `n + 2 - 1` if `n` is divisible by `i`, which simplifies to `n + 1`. The state of `n` is not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, if `n` is divisible by `i`, then `res` is an integer equal to `n + 1`.**
