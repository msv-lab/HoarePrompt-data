The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` depends on whether `num` is even or not. If `num` is even, `count` is initially 3, so `count` becomes 4. If `num` is odd, `count` is initially 5, so `count` becomes 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, and if `num` is even, `count` is 4, otherwise `count` is 6.

Output State: **`num` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, and if `num` is even, `count` is 4, otherwise `count` is 6**
