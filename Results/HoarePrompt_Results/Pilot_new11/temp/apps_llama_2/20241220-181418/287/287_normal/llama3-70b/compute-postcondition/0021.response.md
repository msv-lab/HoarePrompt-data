The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, given the context of a typical problem, it seems there might be an oversight in the problem description, as the constraint mentions an input integer `n`. Assuming the function is intended to operate with this constraint in mind, let's correct the approach based on standard problem-solving expectations.


If we were to follow the given instructions literally without the parameter, the description would be incomplete because it doesn't specify what the function returns or how it behaves based on any input. However, considering the constraint that mentions an integer `n` such that `1 <= n <= 10^9`, and assuming the function is supposed to take this integer into account, the corrected understanding would be:


The function, as intended, might accept an integer `n` where `1 <= n <= 10^9`. Without the specific output conditions (e.g., Cases), we can't detail the return values directly. Normally, the functionality would describe how `n` influences the return value, possibly including multiple Cases based on conditions related to `n`. However, without explicit output details or Cases, we're limited in our description.


Given this, and adhering strictly to the format requested without further information on how `n` affects the output, the functionality description would be incomplete. But let's attempt a general formulation based on the assumption that `n` is indeed a parameter, despite the literal transcription of the function definition provided:


Functionality: **The function is expected to accept an integer parameter n, where 1 <= n <= 10^9, but without specific output conditions, its exact functionality cannot be accurately described.**
