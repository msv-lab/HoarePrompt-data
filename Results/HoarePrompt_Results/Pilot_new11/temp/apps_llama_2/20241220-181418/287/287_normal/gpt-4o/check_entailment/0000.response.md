Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. The program provided seems to be counting the divisors of the number `n`, which is not the same as finding the different weights of its splits.

A correct solution should consider all possible non-increasing sequences of positive integers that sum up to `n`, calculate the weight of each split (i.e., the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element), and then count the number of distinct weights.

Here is a simple counterexample: for `n = 7`, the program will return `4` because `7` has `4` divisors (`1`, `7`), but considering the note in the problem description, the correct weight count for `7` is indeed `4`, which matches the example given. However, this does not validate the program's correctness for all cases.

The flaw in the program is more apparent when you analyze what the function `func_1(num)` is doing. It counts the divisors of a number, not the weights of splits as defined by the problem. A split's weight, as per the problem definition, is the number of times the largest number (or the first number, since the sequence is non-increasing) appears in the split, not the count of divisors of the total sum.

For example, for `n = 8`, the splits and their weights are as described in the note, leading to weights of `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `8`, corresponding to the splits `[8]`, `[4, 4]`, `[3, 3, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, respectively. The program, however, would not calculate these weights correctly based on the divisor count logic.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need a different approach, such as generating all possible splits of `n` and calculating the weight of each split according to the problem's definition.
