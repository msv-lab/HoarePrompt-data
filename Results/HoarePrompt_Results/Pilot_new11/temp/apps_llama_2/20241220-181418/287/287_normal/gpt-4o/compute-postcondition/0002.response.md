According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. If `i` squared is less than or equal to `num`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, `i` squared is 1. For the loop to execute, `num` must be greater than or equal to 1, which is already the case. However, to ensure that the loop can execute at least one time with the given condition, no additional adjustment to the state of `num` is needed because `i` squared (1) is already less than or equal to any positive integer `num`. 

State: **`num` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `count` is 0, `i` is 1**
