Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of a given integer `n`, where a split is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the weight of a split is the number of elements equal to the first element. However, the provided code calculates the total number of divisors of `n`, not the number of different weights of splits. 

For example, given `n = 7`, the code will output `4` which is the correct answer according to the problem description (the weights are 1, 2, 3, and 7 as shown in the problem statement). However, this is just a coincidence. The code is actually calculating the number of divisors of `7` (1, 7), which is `2`, and due to the logic of incrementing by 2 and then subtracting 1 when `n` is a perfect square (which does not apply in this case), it ends up with an incorrect formula that sometimes matches the correct answer by chance.

The code does not consider the concept of splits or their weights as defined in the problem. It simply calculates the number of divisors of `n` using a specific formula and prints the result. The output hints also suggest this, stating that the function calculates and returns the total number of divisors of `n`.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, making its correctness **False**.
