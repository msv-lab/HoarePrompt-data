Given the Initial State: `num` must be at least 9, `i` is 2, and if `num` is 2 or 4, then `count` is 0, otherwise `count` is 2. Since `num` is at least 9, it implies that `count` is 2.

The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1.

So, the new value of `count` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `num` is still at least 9, and `i` is still 2.

Output State: **`num` is at least 9, `i` is 2, `count` is 3**
