Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `n` is 1 (which means `n` is a square of `i` and `n` is a multiple of `i`), then `res` is 1. If `n` is not 1, then there is no update on `res` and the original condition still holds: if `n` is a multiple of `i`, then `res` is 2.***
