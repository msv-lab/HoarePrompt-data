The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` depends on whether `num` is even or odd. If `num` is even, `count` was 2, so now it's 3. If `num` is odd, `count` was 4, so now it's 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`num` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, and if `num` is even, `count` is 3, otherwise `count` is 5**
