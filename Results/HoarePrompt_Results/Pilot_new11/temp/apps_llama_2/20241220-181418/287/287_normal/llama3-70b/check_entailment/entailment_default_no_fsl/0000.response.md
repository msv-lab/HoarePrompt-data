Correctness: **False**

The provided code calculates the total number of divisors of a given integer `n`, not the number of different weights of its splits. The code does not correctly implement the problem description, as it counts the divisors instead of calculating the weights of splits.

For example, given the input `7`, the code will calculate the divisors of `7` (which are `1` and `7`), resulting in a total of `2` divisors, but it will not correctly identify the different weights of splits of `7` as `1`, `2`, `3`, and `7`, which corresponds to the splits `[7]`, `[3, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

A correct implementation would involve generating all possible splits of `n` and then counting the number of different weights of these splits. The code provided does not attempt to do this, and therefore, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach would be needed, such as generating all possible combinations of non-increasing integers that sum up to `n`, calculating the weight of each combination (the number of elements equal to the largest element), and then counting the number of unique weights. The provided code does not accomplish this task.
