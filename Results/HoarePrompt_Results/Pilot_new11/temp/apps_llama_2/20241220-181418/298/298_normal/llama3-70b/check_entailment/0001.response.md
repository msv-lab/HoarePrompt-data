Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not seem to directly address the problem description. It defines three functions, `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, which appear to be related to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and potentially solving linear Diophantine equations. However, the program does not contain any logic that explicitly attempts to find three integer points that satisfy the condition of forming a triangle with an area equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

A specific case where the program does not work correctly is when the inputs are the same as the first example in the problem description: $n = 4$, $m = 3$, and $k = 3$. The program does not output "YES" followed by the coordinates of three points that form a triangle with an area of $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$, as required by the problem description. Instead, it does not provide any relevant output because it does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to be significantly modified or extended to find suitable points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ that satisfy the given constraints and the area requirement. The current implementation does not demonstrate an attempt to solve the specific geometric problem presented.
