Functionality: **The function `func_2` calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean algorithm, providing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. The function takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple of two values: either `(1, 0)` when `b` equals `0`, indicating that the GCD is `a` (or `b` when `a` is `0`), or the results of recursive calculations involving integer division and modulo operations for other cases. The function handles edge cases where either `a` or `b` is `0`, returning the non-zero value as the GCD and the corresponding coefficient. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it provides the coefficients `x` and `y` for the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, effectively giving the GCD and its representation as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.**
