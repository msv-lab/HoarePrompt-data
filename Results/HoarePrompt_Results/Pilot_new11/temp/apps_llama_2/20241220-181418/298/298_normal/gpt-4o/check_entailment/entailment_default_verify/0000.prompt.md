You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ â€” coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. 

For example, consider the input `n = 5, m = 5, k = 2`. The program calculates the area as `25 / 2 = 12.5`, which is not an integer, so it correctly outputs "NO". However, this output does not guarantee that there are no such points.

A more critical issue arises when the calculated area is an integer, but the program's approach to finding the points does not work. 

The code checks if `2 * area <= n` or `2 * area <= m`, and if so, it tries to find points that satisfy the condition. However, this approach may not always work, especially when `n` and `m` are large and `k` is small.

For instance, consider the input `n = 100, m = 100, k = 4`. The area is `100 * 100 / 4 = 2500`, which is an integer. However, `2 * area = 5000` is greater than both `n` and `m`, so the program's conditions are not met. In this case, the program should try to find other points that satisfy the condition, but it does not.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, and its correctness is **False**. 

One possible improvement to the program would be to use a more general approach to find the points, rather than relying on specific conditions. This could involve using geometric algorithms or techniques to find points that satisfy the area condition. However, implementing such an approach would require a more detailed understanding of the problem and its constraints.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes three integer inputs (n, m, k) from the user, which are expected to be within specific ranges (1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9), and determines whether the area calculated as n * m / k is an integer and not equal to 0. If the area is not an integer or is 0, the function prints 'NO'. If the area is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' and '0 0', followed by additional coordinates based on the comparison of 2 * area with n and m. Specifically, it prints either '2 * area 1' and '0 1' if 2 * area is less than or equal to n, '1 2 * area' and '1 0' if 2 * area is larger than n but less than or equal to m, or 'n m // 2' and '0 m // 2' if 2 * area exceeds both n and m. The function's intended purpose seems to be related to geometric or spatial calculations, possibly involving rectangular areas divided into smaller sections, but its exact application or significance cannot be determined without further context.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
