The program returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. 
`x` and `y` are the returned values from `func_2(a, b)`, but their exact values are unknown because the implementation of `func_2` is not provided. 
`a` and `b` are integers, but their exact values are also unknown.

Output State: **The program returns x and y, which are the returned values from func_2(a, b), and the result of the expression x * a + y * b, where x, y, a, and b are of unknown specific values, but a and b are integers.**
