#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the absolute value of the original `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b`, not the absolute value of the original `a` as stated in the annotations. The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their GCD, which is an integer. The state of the program after it concludes is that it has computed and returned the GCD of the input integers, with no modifications to the input variables `a` and `b` outside of the function scope. The function handles cases where `b` is 0 by returning `a`, which is a valid GCD operation. There is a discrepancy between the annotations and the actual code behavior, where the annotations incorrectly state that the function returns the absolute value of the original `a`, whereas the code actually computes and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0, where 0 is the current value of b
    else :
        x, y = func_2(b, a % b)
        return y, x - a // b * y
        #The program returns two values: `y`, which is a value returned by `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the result of the expression `x - a // b * y`, where `x` is also a return value from `func_2(b, a % b)`, `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `y` is as described.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input integers `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean algorithm, providing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. The function takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple of two values: either `(1, 0)` when `b` equals `0`, indicating that the GCD is `a` (or `b` when `a` is `0`), or the results of recursive calculations involving integer division and modulo operations for other cases. The function handles edge cases where either `a` or `b` is `0`, returning the non-zero value as the GCD and the corresponding coefficient. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it provides the coefficients `x` and `y` for the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, effectively giving the GCD and its representation as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y = func_2(a, b)
    return x, y, x * a + y * b
    #The program returns x and y, which are the returned values from func_2(a, b), and the result of the expression x * a + y * b, where x, y, a, and b are of unknown specific values, but a and b are integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns three values: `x`, `y`, and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`. Here, `x` and `y` are the returned values from the function `func_2(a, b)`, which is called within this function. The specific values of `x` and `y` depend on the implementation of `func_2(a, b)`, which is not provided in the given code. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` and `b`. It only uses them to compute and return the specified values. Note that the function's behavior is dependent on the implementation of `func_2(a, b)`, which might introduce additional edge cases or effects not directly apparent from the given code.
