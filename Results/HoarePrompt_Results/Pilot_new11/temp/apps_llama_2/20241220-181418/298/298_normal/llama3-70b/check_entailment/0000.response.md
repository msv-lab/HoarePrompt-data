Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program appears to be implementing functions for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and Extended Euclidean Algorithm, but it does not use these functions to find the points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to (n*m)/k. The program does not provide any logic to find these points.

A correct approach to solve this problem would involve checking if (n*m)/k is an integer and then finding three points that satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle. The points (0, 0), (n, 0), and (0, m) can be used as a starting point, and then the points can be adjusted to satisfy the condition for the area of the triangle.

For example, if n = 4, m = 3, and k = 3, the program should output:

YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

But the given program does not provide any output for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect. 

Here is an example of a correct program in python:
```python
def find_points(n, m, k):
    if (n * m) % k!= 0:
        return "NO"
    else:
        area = (n * m) // k
        height = m
        base = (2 * area) // height
        if base > n:
            return "NO"
        return "YES\n0 0\n{} 0\n{} {}".format(base, n, m)

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
print(find_points(n, m, k))
```
