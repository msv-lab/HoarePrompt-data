The code prints a string '1 ' followed by the value of 2 * `area`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are not changed by this code. The value of 2 * `area` is still larger than `n` and less than or equal to `m`. 'YES' has been printed, and '0 0' has been printed. Now, an additional string '1 ' followed by the value of 2 * `area` has been printed. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, '1 {2 * `area`}' has been printed, and 2 * `area` is larger than `n` and less than or equal to `m`.**
