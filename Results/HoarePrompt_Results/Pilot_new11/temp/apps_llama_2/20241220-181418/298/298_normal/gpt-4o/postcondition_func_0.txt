The function takes three integer inputs (n, m, k) from the user, which are expected to be within specific ranges (1 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 10^9), and determines whether the area calculated as n * m / k is an integer and not equal to 0. If the area is not an integer or is 0, the function prints 'NO'. If the area is a non-zero integer, it prints 'YES' and '0 0', followed by additional coordinates based on the comparison of 2 * area with n and m. Specifically, it prints either '2 * area 1' and '0 1' if 2 * area is less than or equal to n, '1 2 * area' and '1 0' if 2 * area is larger than n but less than or equal to m, or 'n m // 2' and '0 m // 2' if 2 * area exceeds both n and m. The function's intended purpose seems to be related to geometric or spatial calculations, possibly involving rectangular areas divided into smaller sections, but its exact application or significance cannot be determined without further context.
