You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given recipe. 

Here's why:

1. It correctly calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of the number of lemons available (`a`), half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), and a quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`). This ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available number of lemons, apples, or pears.

2. It correctly calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying `max_lemons` by 1 (for lemons), 2 (for apples), and 4 (for pears), and summing the results.

The program works correctly for all possible inputs because it checks all three types of fruits to determine the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which in turn determines the maximum number of apples and pears that can be used. This approach ensures that the ratio of lemons to apples to pears is always 1:2:4, as required by the recipe.

The provided examples demonstrate this:

- In the first example, `max_lemons` is 1, so the total number of fruits is 1 (lemon) + 2 (apples) + 4 (pears) = 7.
- In the second example, `max_lemons` is 3, so the total number of fruits is 3 (lemons) + 6 (apples) + 12 (pears) = 21.
- In the third example, `max_lemons` is 0 because there are not enough pears, so the total number of fruits is 0.

The program handles all possible cases correctly and follows the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function takes three positive integers as inputs from the user, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, and calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make a fruit combination where each combination consists of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. It then calculates the total number of fruits in this combination and prints the result. The function does not handle cases where the input values are not positive integers or are outside the range of 1 to 1000, and it does not provide any error messages for invalid inputs. The final state of the program is that it has printed the total number of fruits in the calculated combination, without modifying the original input values or retaining any information about the input or calculation beyond the printed output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
