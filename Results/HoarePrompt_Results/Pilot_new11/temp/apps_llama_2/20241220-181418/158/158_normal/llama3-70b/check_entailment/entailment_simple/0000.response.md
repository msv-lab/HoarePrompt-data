Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input and stores them in the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.
2. Then, it calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used to make the compote using the ratio 1:2:4. This is done by finding the minimum value between `a`, `b // 2` (since for each lemon, there should be two apples), and `c // 4` (since for each lemon, there should be four pears). The `//` operator is used for integer division, which ensures that the result is an integer.
3. Finally, the program calculates the total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote by multiplying the minimum number of lemons by the corresponding number of apples and pears according to the ratio. The total is then printed as the output.

This approach ensures that the program always follows the problem description and produces the correct output for every potential case. It correctly handles cases where one or more types of fruits are not sufficient to make the compote, and it also handles cases where the input values are large or small.

For example, if the input is `2`, `5`, and `7`, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of lemons as `1` (since `2 // 2` is `1` and `7 // 4` is `1`), and then prints the total number of fruits as `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.

Similarly, if the input is `4`, `7`, and `13`, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of lemons as `3` (since `4 // 1` is `4`, `7 // 2` is `3`, and `13 // 4` is `3`), and then prints the total number of fruits as `3 + 6 + 12 = 21`.

Finally, if the input is `2`, `3`, and `2`, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of lemons as `0` (since `2 // 1` is `2`, `3 // 2` is `1`, and `2 // 4` is `0`), and then prints the total number of fruits as `0`.
