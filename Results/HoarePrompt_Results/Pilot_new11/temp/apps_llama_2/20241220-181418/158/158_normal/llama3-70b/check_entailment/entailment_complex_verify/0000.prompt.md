You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

I believe the program is correct because it accurately determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. The program calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the available lemons, apples, and pears, considering the required ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It takes the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input and calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used with the available fruits, considering the ratio. 
   - `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that the number of lemons does not exceed the number of available lemons, apples, or pears when multiplied by their respective ratios.

2. Then, it prints the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote by multiplying the minimum number of lemons by the ratios and summing them up. 
   - `print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)` calculates the total number of fruits that can be used.

The program handles all possible cases, including when no fruits can be used due to insufficient quantities. For example, if the input is 2, 3, and 2, the output will correctly be 0 because there are not enough pears to cook a compote with the required ratio. 

Overall, the program's logic aligns with the problem description, and I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three positive integers from the user, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, calculates the minimum quantity that can be used to make a lemon-apple-pear combination (with a ratio of 1:2:4), and prints the total quantity of the combination. The function does not validate if the input integers are within the specified range of 1 to 1000, and it does not handle cases where the user inputs non-integer or non-positive values. The function's output is the total quantity of the combination, which is the sum of the minimum quantity of lemons, twice the minimum quantity of lemons (representing apples), and four times the minimum quantity of lemons (representing pears). The function does not return any value, as it prints the result directly to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
