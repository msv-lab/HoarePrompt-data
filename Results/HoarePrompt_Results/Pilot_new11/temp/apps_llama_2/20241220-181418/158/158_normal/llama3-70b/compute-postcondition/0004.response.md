To calculate the result, we first need to understand the value of `min_lemon`. `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This means `min_lemon` can be any of these values: `a`, `b // 2`, or `c // 4`, whichever is the smallest.

The code then calculates and prints `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This expression simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)` which is `min_lemon * 7`.

Since we are printing the result of `min_lemon * 7` and not assigning it to any variable, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `min_lemon` remain unchanged. The print statement does not modify the state of the variables but rather outputs the calculated value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the value `min_lemon * 7` has been printed.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the value `min_lemon * 7` has been printed**
