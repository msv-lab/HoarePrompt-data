Correctness: **True**.

The code correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote, based on the given ratio of 1:2:4. The function uses the `min` function to find the minimum quantity of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used, ensuring that the fruits are in the correct ratio. This minimum quantity is then used to calculate the total quantity of the combination.

The code handles the cases where the input integers are within the specified range of 1 to 1000, and it correctly calculates the total quantity of the combination. The function does not need to validate the input integers because we assume that the input will be valid.

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the code:

- For the input `2`, `5`, and `7`, the output is `7`, which is correct because Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
- For the input `4`, `7`, and `13`, the output is `21`, which is correct because Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears.
- For the input `2`, `3`, and `2`, the output is `0` is expected when the fruits are not in the ratio 1:2:4 and indeed it is `7` for input `2`, `4`, `8`, the code is giving correct answer which is also `7`,  for this case the code does the following calculation `min(2,4//2, 8//4)` which equals `min(2,2,2)` equals `2`, `2+2*2+2*4=2+4+8=14`, which is the total number of fruits used when using `2` lemons, `4` apples and `8` pears.

Since the code correctly handles all the provided examples and the logic is sound, we can conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
