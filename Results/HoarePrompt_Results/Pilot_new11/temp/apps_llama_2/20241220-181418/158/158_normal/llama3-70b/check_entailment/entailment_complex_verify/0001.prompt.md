You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the given problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. The key to this program is the line where it calculates `min_lemon`, which represents the maximum number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available quantities of apples and pears.

The formula `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that the number of lemons used is within the limits imposed by the quantities of apples and pears, given the required ratio of 1:2:4. After determining `min_lemon`, the program then prints the total number of fruits that can be used, which is `min_lemon` (for lemons) + `min_lemon * 2` (for apples) + `min_lemon * 4` (for pears).

This approach correctly handles all potential cases, including when Nikolay can't use any fruits because the quantity of one type of fruit is insufficient to meet the required ratio, in which case `min_lemon` will be 0, resulting in a total of 0, which aligns with the problem description.

All the provided examples are correctly handled by this program:

- For input 2, 5, 7, `min_lemon` is 1 (limited by the lemons and the ratio), so the total is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
- For input 4, 7, 13, `min_lemon` is 3 (limited by the lemons and the ratio), so the total is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.
- For input 2, 3, 2, `min_lemon` is 0 (limited by the pears), so the total is 0.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all provided examples correctly, it seems to be a correct solution.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three positive integers from the user, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, calculates the minimum quantity that can be used to make a lemon-apple-pear combination (with a ratio of 1:2:4), and prints the total quantity of the combination. The function does not validate if the input integers are within the specified range of 1 to 1000, and it does not handle cases where the user inputs non-integer or non-positive values. The function's output is the total quantity of the combination, which is the sum of the minimum quantity of lemons, twice the minimum quantity of lemons (representing apples), and four times the minimum quantity of lemons (representing pears). The function does not return any value, as it prints the result directly to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
