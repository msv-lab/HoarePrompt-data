The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given constraints, it seems that the function is supposed to operate on three positive integers: a, b, and c, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. The constraint given is that 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000. Since no output or return values are specified, we cannot determine the exact functionality of the function in terms of its output. 

However, based on the format you requested, here's an attempt to describe the functionality:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but is associated with the constraints of three positive integers a, b, and c, representing lemons, apples, and pears, where 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000, and its return value is unspecified.**
