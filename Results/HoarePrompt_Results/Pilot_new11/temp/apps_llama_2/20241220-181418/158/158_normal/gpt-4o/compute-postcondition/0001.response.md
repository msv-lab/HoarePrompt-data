The code `b = int(input())` updates the value of `b` to an input integer. The previous value of `b` as a positive integer is overwritten. The value of `a` is still an input integer, and the value of `c` is still a positive integer. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer, such that 1 <= `c` <= 1000**
