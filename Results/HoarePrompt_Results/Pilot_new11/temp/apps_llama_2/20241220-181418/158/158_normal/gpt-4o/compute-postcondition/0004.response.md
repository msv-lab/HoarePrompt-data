To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step.

1. The initial state defines `a`, `b`, and `c` as input integers, and `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This means `max_lemons` = min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`).
2. The code calculates `total_fruits` based on `max_lemons`. The formula is `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`.
3. Simplifying the formula, we get `total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)` = `max_lemons * 7`.
4. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `max_lemons` are not changed by this operation. Only `total_fruits` is updated.
5. Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `max_lemons`, along with the new value of `total_fruits`.

Given that `max_lemons` = min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`), we can conclude that the output state is as follows:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
- `total_fruits` is `7 * max_lemons`, which simplifies to `7 * min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is `7 * min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`**
