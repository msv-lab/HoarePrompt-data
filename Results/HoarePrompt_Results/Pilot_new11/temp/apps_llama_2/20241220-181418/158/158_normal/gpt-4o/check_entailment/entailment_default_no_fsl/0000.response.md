Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make a fruit combination where each combination consists of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears, based on the available number of lemons, apples, and pears.

The code uses the `min` function to find the maximum number of lemons that can be used, taking into account the available number of apples and pears. This ensures that the program does not try to use more apples or pears than are available.

The code then calculates the total number of fruits in the combination by multiplying the number of lemons by 7 (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears per lemon).

The code handles all potential cases, including cases where the input values are at the maximum (1000) or minimum (1), and cases where the input values are not exactly divisible by the ratio (e.g. 1 lemon, 3 apples, 4 pears).

The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correctness of the code. For example, when the input is 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears, the code correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (1) and the total number of fruits in the combination (1 + 2 + 4 = 7).

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases.
