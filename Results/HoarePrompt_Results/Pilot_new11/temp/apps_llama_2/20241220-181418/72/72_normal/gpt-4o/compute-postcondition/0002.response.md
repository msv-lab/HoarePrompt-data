The value of `y` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `y` was an integer input. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Since `x` is `x - 1`, this means `x` is actually not defined in terms of its initial value but is expressed in relation to itself, however, we keep the given expression for `x`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, `x` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer input minus 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input less than or equal to 10^18, `x` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer input minus 1**
