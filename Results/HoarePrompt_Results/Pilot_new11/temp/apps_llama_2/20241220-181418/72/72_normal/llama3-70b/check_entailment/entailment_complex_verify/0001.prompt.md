You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to be correct based on the given problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum number of times a pupil can be asked, the minimum number of times a pupil can be asked, and the number of times Sergei is asked.

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

- `max_asked` calculates the maximum number of times a pupil can be asked by dividing the total number of questions (`k`) plus the number of rows minus 1 by twice the number of rows (`2 * n`). This ensures that the last row is also considered, even if the total number of questions is not a multiple of the number of rows.
- `min_asked` calculates the minimum number of times a pupil can be asked by taking the maximum of 1 and `max_asked` minus the number of rows minus 1. This ensures that the minimum number of times a pupil can be asked is at least 1, even if `max_asked` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.
- `sergei_asked` calculates the number of times Sergei is asked by dividing the total number of questions (`k`) plus the row number of Sergei minus 1 by twice the number of rows (`2 * n`), and then adding 1 if the remainder of the division is greater than or equal to the number of rows minus the row number of Sergei plus 1. This ensures that Sergei's position is correctly considered, even if he is in the first or last row.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there is only one row in the class or when the total number of questions is not a multiple of the number of rows. It also correctly handles cases where Sergei is in the first or last row, or where he is in a row that is asked more frequently than others.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the provided examples, and it seems to produce the correct output in all cases. Without a counterexample, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the number of rows and columns in the seating arrangement, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of questions asked, x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x <= n and 1 <= y <= m, representing Sergei's row and position.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five parameters (n, m, k, x, and y) from the user, where n and m are positive integers representing the number of rows and columns in the seating arrangement, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of questions asked, and x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x <= n and 1 <= y <= m, representing Sergei's row and position. It calculates and prints three values: max_asked, min_asked, and sergei_asked, which represent the maximum number of questions that can be asked, the minimum number of questions that must be asked, and the number of questions Sergei asked, respectively. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after it concludes is that it has printed these three calculated values to the console, but the input variables (n, m, k, x, and y) remain unchanged. The function assumes that the input will be valid and does not include any error checking or handling.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
