#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the number of rows and columns in the seating arrangement, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of questions asked, x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x <= n and 1 <= y <= m, representing Sergei's row and position.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five parameters (n, m, k, x, and y) from the user, where n and m are positive integers representing the number of rows and columns in the seating arrangement, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of questions asked, and x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x <= n and 1 <= y <= m, representing Sergei's row and position. It calculates and prints three values: max_asked, min_asked, and sergei_asked, which represent the maximum number of questions that can be asked, the minimum number of questions that must be asked, and the number of questions Sergei asked, respectively. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after it concludes is that it has printed these three calculated values to the console, but the input variables (n, m, k, x, and y) remain unchanged. The function assumes that the input will be valid and does not include any error checking or handling.
