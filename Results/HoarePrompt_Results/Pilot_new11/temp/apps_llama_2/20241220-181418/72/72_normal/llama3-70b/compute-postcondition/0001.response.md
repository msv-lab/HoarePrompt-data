To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.

The code is: `max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`

This line of code calculates the value of `max_asked` based on the input integers `k` and `n`. The expression `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` performs integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number.

The values of `m`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state includes the initial state information for variables that were not changed, and it includes the new value for `max_asked`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `max_asked` is `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`**
