The code line `n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` based on the input provided. 

After the code is executed, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers because `map(int, input().split())` converts the input into integers. The previous constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `1 <= n, m <= 100` are still valid. 

However, the new values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are now the input integers, and `x` and `y` will be the input values which may or may not satisfy `1 <= x <= n` and `1 <= y <= m`. 

The value of `k` is updated to a non-negative integer value from the input and is still `k <= 10^18`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input, `m` is a positive integer input, `k` is a non-negative integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is an integer input, and `k` is less than or equal to 10^18**
