Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The problem states that Polycarp wants to choose a pair of shovels to sell in such a way that the sum of their costs ends with a maximum possible number of nines. However, the provided code does not correctly calculate this.

The code only checks the number of trailing 9s in the input number `n` and multiplies it by `n + 1` to get the number of pairs. However, this approach does not consider the actual costs of the shovels and how their sums would end with a maximum possible number of nines.

For example, if `n` is 10, the code would remove the trailing 9 (actually, there is no trailing 9 in 10) and then multiply `n + 1` by 0 (since there are no trailing 9s), resulting in 0 pairs. However, the correct answer should be the number of pairs whose cost sums end with the maximum possible number of nines, which in this case would be pairs like (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), and (5, 5).

The code does not correctly solve the problem and does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

One of the cases when the code does not work as expected is when `n` equals 10. In this case, the code would return 0, but the correct answer is 5 (the pairs (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), and (5, 5) all have a sum that ends with a 0, but not with the maximum possible number of nines, which for `n = 10` is actually one 0, which is not 9, but the pair (5, 5) has the sum 10 that ends with one 0, and there are no other pairs with a larger number of 9s at the end). 

However, for `n = 10`, we should consider that no pair of shovels costs will end with more than one 9 (actually none will end with one 9, but some pairs will end with one 0), so we should consider all the pairs that have their cost sum ending with one 0. But actually, for `n = 10`, all the pairs with the sum of costs ending with the maximum possible number of nines are (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6) and (5, 5).
