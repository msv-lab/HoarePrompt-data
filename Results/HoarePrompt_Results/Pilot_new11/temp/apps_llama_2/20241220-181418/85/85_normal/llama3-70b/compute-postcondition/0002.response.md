According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n // 2 + 1`. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer and `ans` is 0, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
