Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it is only checking pairs where the first shovel has a cost less than or equal to half of the total cost of the pair. However, this is not sufficient to cover all cases. The program should be checking all possible pairs of shovels, not just those that satisfy this condition.

For example, consider the case where `n = 10`. In this case, the pair `(5, 5)` should be counted, because the sum of their costs is `10`, which ends with a `0`. However, the program will not count this pair, because `5` is equal to half of the total cost of the pair, and the program only checks pairs where the first shovel has a cost strictly less than half of the total cost.

Another issue with the program is that it is using `len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1` to calculate the number of digits in the sum of the costs, which is not correct. This will not work correctly for all cases, especially for large values of `n`.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible pairs of shovels, calculate the sum of their costs, and check if it ends with the maximum possible number of nines. If it does, increment the count of pairs.

Here's an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    max_nines = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            sum_costs = i + j
            nines = 0
            while sum_costs % 10 == 9:
                sum_costs //= 10
                nines += 1
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                ans = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```
