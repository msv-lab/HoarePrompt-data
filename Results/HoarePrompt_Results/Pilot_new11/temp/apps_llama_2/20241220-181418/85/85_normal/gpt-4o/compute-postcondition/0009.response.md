The value of `max_9s` is incremented by 1, so `max_9s` becomes 3. The state of `n` is not affected, so it remains 9 less than the next multiple of 10 after the previous iteration's value.

Output State: **`n` is 9 less than the next multiple of 10 after the previous iteration's value, `max_9s` is 3**
