To calculate the output state, we'll follow the given code step by step.

1. The initial state provides that `x` is an integer in the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18 and `normalized_angle` is an integer in the range -359 ≤ `normalized_angle` ≤ 360, where `normalized_angle` = `x` % 360.

2. The code calculates `turns` as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `360 - normalized_angle` gives the distance from `normalized_angle` to 360.
- `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90` calculates how many quarters (90 degrees each) fit into this distance. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- Finally, `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` calculates the remainder when the number of quarters is divided by 4, effectively cyclically mapping the quarters to a range of 0 to 3.

Given the range of `normalized_angle` (-359 to 360), let's analyze the possible values of `turns`:
- When `normalized_angle` is 0 (or a multiple of 360), `turns` = `(360 - 0) // 90 % 4` = `4 % 4` = 0.
- As `normalized_angle` increases from 0 to 360, `(360 - normalized_angle)` decreases. When `normalized_angle` reaches 90, `(360 - 90) // 90 % 4` = `270 // 90 % 4` = `3 % 4` = 3.
- When `normalized_angle` is between 90 and 180, `(360 - normalized_angle)` will yield a value that when divided by 90 gives a quotient between 2 and 1 (exclusive), leading to a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.
- Continuing this logic, we see that `turns` cycles through 0, 3, 2, 1 as `normalized_angle` moves from 0 to 360.

For negative values of `normalized_angle` (down to -359), we can apply the same logic considering the modulo operation's effect on the angle.

However, because `turns` is calculated using integer division and modulo operations on values derived from `normalized_angle`, and given that `normalized_angle` itself remains within the specified range, `turns` will indeed be an integer between 0 and 3 (inclusive), depending on the quadrant that `normalized_angle` falls into relative to the 360-degree cycle.

Therefore, the output state includes:
- `x` remains an integer in the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18.
- `normalized_angle` remains an integer in the range -359 ≤ `normalized_angle` ≤ 360, where `normalized_angle` = `x` % 360.
- `turns` is an integer in the range 0 ≤ `turns` ≤ 3, calculated as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, `normalized_angle` is an integer in the range -359 ≤ `normalized_angle` ≤ 360 where `normalized_angle` = `x` % 360, `turns` is an integer in the range 0 ≤ `turns` ≤ 3**
