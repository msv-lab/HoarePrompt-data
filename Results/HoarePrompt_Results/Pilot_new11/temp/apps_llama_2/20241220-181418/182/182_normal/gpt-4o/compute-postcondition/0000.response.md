The code `x = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `x`. The input represents the camera angle in degrees. 

Since the input is an integer and the angle is in the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, the value of `x` will be an integer in this range. 

Therefore, `x` is an integer in the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, representing the camera angle in degrees.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, representing the camera angle in degrees, where positive values denote clockwise camera rotation and negative values denote counter-clockwise rotation.**
