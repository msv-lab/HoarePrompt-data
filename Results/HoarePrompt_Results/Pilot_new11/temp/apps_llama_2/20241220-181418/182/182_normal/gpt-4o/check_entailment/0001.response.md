Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

For instance, when the input is a negative angle, the program does not correctly normalize it to the equivalent positive angle within the range of 0 to 360 degrees. 

In the given code, the line `normalized_angle = x % 360` can result in a negative value if `x` is negative, which does not meet the requirements of the problem. 

To fix this issue, the code should ensure that the normalized angle is always in the range of 0 to 360 degrees, regardless of whether the input is positive or negative.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    turns = (90 - normalized_angle) % 360 // 90 % 4
    print(turns)
```
However, even this corrected version may not produce the correct output for all possible inputs, as the calculation of the number of turns is based on the assumption that a clockwise rotation of the camera results in a counter-clockwise rotation of the image, and that the FPGA solution can only rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise.

A more accurate implementation would take into account these facts and calculate the number of turns accordingly. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    # Normalize the angle to the range of 0 to 360 degrees
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    
    # Calculate the counter-clockwise rotation of the image
    image_rotation = (360 - normalized_angle) % 360
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required
    turns = (360 - image_rotation) // 90 % 4
    
    print(turns)
```
