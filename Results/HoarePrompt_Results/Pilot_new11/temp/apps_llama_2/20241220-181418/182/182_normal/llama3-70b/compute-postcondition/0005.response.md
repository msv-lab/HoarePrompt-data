The given Python code calculates and prints the value of the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. 

To evaluate this expression, we first calculate `x + 90 - 1`, which is equivalent to `x + 89`. Since `x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive) and `x` is not equal to 0, the value of `x + 89` will be between -270 and 448 (inclusive).

Next, we perform integer division of `x + 89` by 90, which is equivalent to `(x + 89) // 90`. This will give us the largest integer less than or equal to `(x + 89) / 90`.

Finally, we calculate the modulus of the result with 4, which gives us the remainder when the result is divided by 4. 

The values of `x + 89` and `(x + 89) // 90` are as follows:
- For `x` between -359 and -270 (inclusive), `(x + 89) // 90` will be -4 or -3.
- For `x` between -269 and -179 (inclusive), `(x + 89) // 90` will be -3 or -2.
- For `x` between -178 and -89 (inclusive), `(x + 89) // 90` will be -2 or -1.
- For `x` between -88 and 0 (exclusive), `(x + 89) // 90` will be -1 or 0.
- For `x` between 1 and 89 (inclusive), `(x + 89) // 90` will be 0 or 1.
- For `x` between 90 and 179 (inclusive), `(x + 89) // 90` will be 1 or 2.
- For `x` between 180 and 269 (inclusive), `(x + 89) // 90` will be 2 or 3.
- For `x` between 270 and 359 (inclusive), `(x + 89) // 90` will be 3 or 4.

Since we are taking the modulus of the result with 4, the final values will be between 0 and 3 (inclusive).

The camera angle in degrees is not affected by this code, so its value remains an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive).

The value of `x` is also not changed by the code, so it remains an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive) and is not equal to 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: The camera angle in degrees is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive) and `x` is not equal to 0, and the printed value is an integer between 0 and 3 (inclusive) equal to `(x + 89) // 90 % 4`.

Output State: **The camera angle in degrees is an integer between -10^18 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between -359 and 359 (inclusive) and `x` is not equal to 0, and the printed value is an integer between 0 and 3 (inclusive) equal to `(x + 89) // 90 % 4`.**
