The code calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 360 and assigns it to `normalized_angle`. This operation effectively normalizes the camera angle to the range -360 < `normalized_angle` ≤ 360, while preserving the direction of rotation.

Since `x` is an integer in the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, the value of `normalized_angle` will be in the range -359 ≤ `normalized_angle` ≤ 360, due to the properties of the modulo operation.

The state of `x` remains unchanged, as it is not assigned a new value.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range -10^18 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, `normalized_angle` is an integer in the range -359 ≤ `normalized_angle` ≤ 360, where `normalized_angle` = `x` % 360**
