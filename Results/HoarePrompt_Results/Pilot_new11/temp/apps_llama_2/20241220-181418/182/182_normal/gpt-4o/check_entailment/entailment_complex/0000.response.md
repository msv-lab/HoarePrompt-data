Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

The problem description states that the picture should be rotated only on an angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image, and the number of turns should be minimized. However, the program calculates the number of turns as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`, which is incorrect.

Let's analyze the calculation:

* `x % 360` normalizes the angle to a value between 0 and 359.
* `(360 - normalized_angle)` calculates the angle to the nearest 90-degree mark in the clockwise direction.
* `// 90` calculates the number of 90-degree marks in this angle.
* `% 4` limits the number of turns to 0, 1, 2, or 3.

The issue is that this calculation does not always find the minimum number of turns. For example, if the input angle is -60 degrees, the normalized angle is 300 degrees. The calculation `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4` results in 0 turns, but the correct answer is 3 turns (as shown in the problem description example).

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the number of turns as the minimum of `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90` and `(normalized_angle) // 90` modulo 4, considering that a clockwise rotation can also be achieved by rotating counter-clockwise by the complement angle.

Here's a possible correction:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    turns = min((360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4, normalized_angle // 90 % 4)
    if (360 - normalized_angle) % 90 < normalized_angle % 90:
        print((360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4)
    else:
        print(normalized_angle // 90 % 4)
```
However, this is still not the optimal solution. A more efficient solution would be to calculate the absolute deviation of the normalized angle from the nearest 90-degree mark and find the number of turns that minimizes this deviation.

In conclusion, the original program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and a corrected version is needed to achieve the desired result.
