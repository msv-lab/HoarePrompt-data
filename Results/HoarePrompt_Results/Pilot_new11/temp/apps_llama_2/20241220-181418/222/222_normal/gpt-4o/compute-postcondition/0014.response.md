The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer, with the constraints that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and 0 <= `k` <= 1000. However, the specific return values based on the inputs `n` and `k` are not provided in the problem statement. 

Given the lack of information about the output, we can only describe the input parameters' constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, under the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer, with the constraints that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and 0 <= `k` <= 1000.**
