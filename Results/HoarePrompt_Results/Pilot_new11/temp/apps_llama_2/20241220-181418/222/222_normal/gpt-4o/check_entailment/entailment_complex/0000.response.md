Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` generates and prints an arithmetic sequence of positions with a common difference of `2 * k + 1`, starting at 1 and ending at the largest term less than or equal to `n`. This sequence represents the positions of the skewers that need to be turned over to turn over all `n` skewers in the minimum number of actions.

The key insight here is that by turning over the skewers at positions `i`, `i + 2 * k + 1`, `i + 2 * (2 * k + 1)`, and so on, we can effectively turn over all `n` skewers in the minimum number of actions. This is because each turn operation affects `2 * k + 1` skewers, and by spacing out the turn operations by `2 * k + 1` positions, we can ensure that every skewer is turned over exactly once.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is 0 (resulting in a sequence of consecutive integers) or when `n` is less than or equal to 1 (resulting in a sequence of length 1 or 0, respectively).

The program also correctly prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which represents the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all `n` skewers and the positions of the skewers that need to be turned over, respectively.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the strategy for turning over all `n` skewers in the minimum number of actions, as described in the problem description.
