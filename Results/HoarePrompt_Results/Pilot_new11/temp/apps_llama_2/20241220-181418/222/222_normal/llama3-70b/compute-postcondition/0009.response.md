To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `l` is equal to `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.
   - `res` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```
   for i in range(l):
       res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
   ```

3. **Output States after Executing the Loop a Few Times**:
   - After 1 time: `res` contains the value 1, `i` is 0.
   - After 2 times: `res` contains the values 1 and `2 * k + 2` (which can be calculated as `1 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`), `i` is 1.
   - After 3 times: `res` contains the values 1, `2 * k + 2`, and `4 * k + 3` (which can be calculated as `2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`), `i` is 2.

From the loop code, it's clear that `res` is being populated with values calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `l-1`. 

- If `l` is 0 (meaning `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` equals 0), the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty list. This happens when `n + k - 1 < k * 2 + 1`.
- If `l` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `l` times, appending `l` values to `res`. Each value appended is of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `l-1`.

**Calculating the Final State**:

- `n` and `k` retain their original values as input integers.
- `l` is determined by the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, and its value determines how many times the loop executes.
- `res` will contain a list of values where each value is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for `i` from 0 to `l-1`. If `l` is 0, `res` remains an empty list.
- `i` will be `l-1` after the loop finishes, because the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `l-1`.

**Output State**: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, `res` is a list containing values from 1 to `(l-1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` (or empty if `l` is 0), and `i` is `l-1` if `l` > 0, otherwise, `i` remains undefined as the loop doesn't execute.**
