The code `i += 2 * k + 1` increments the value of `i` by `2 * k + 1`. Initially, `i` is `2 * k + 2`, so the new value of `i` will be `(2 * k + 2) + (2 * k + 1)`, which simplifies to `4 * k + 3`. 

Since `n` is greater than `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, and `positions` is a list `[1, 2 * k + 2]`, these conditions remain unchanged as the code only affects the value of `i`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1, 2 * k + 2]`, `i` is `4 * k + 3`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than `2 * k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list `[1, 2 * k + 2]`, `i` is `4 * k + 3`**
