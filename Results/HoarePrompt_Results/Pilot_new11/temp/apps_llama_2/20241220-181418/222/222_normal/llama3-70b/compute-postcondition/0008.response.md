To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `l` is greater than 2
- `res` is a list containing the values 1 and `2 * k + 2`
- `i` is 2
- `n + k - 1` is greater than 0

The given code is: 
```python
res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
```

This code appends a new value to the list `res`. The new value is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, we can substitute `i` in the expression:

`2 * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`

Expanding the expression:

`2 * (2k + 1) + 1 = 4k + 2 + 1 = 4k + 3`

So, the list `res` now contains the values 1, `2 * k + 2`, and `4k + 3`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. The condition `n + k - 1` is greater than 0 remains valid as well.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `l` is greater than 2
- `res` is a list containing the values 1, `2 * k + 2`, and `4k + 3`
- `i` is 2
- `n + k - 1` is greater than 0

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is greater than 2, `res` is a list containing the values 1, `2 * k + 2`, and `4k + 3`, `i` is 2, and `n + k - 1` is greater than 0**
