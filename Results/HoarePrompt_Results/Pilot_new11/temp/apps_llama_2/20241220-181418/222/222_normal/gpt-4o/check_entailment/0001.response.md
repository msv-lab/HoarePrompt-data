Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers and provides the corresponding skewer numbers for these actions.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates over the skewers in steps of `2 * k + 1`, which ensures that each action turns over a non-overlapping set of skewers.
2. By turning over every `(2 * k + 1)`th skewer, the program ensures that each skewer is turned over an odd number of times, which guarantees that all skewers are in the turned-over state at the end.
3. The program correctly prints the minimum number of actions and the corresponding skewer numbers.

The key insight is that by turning over every `(2 * k + 1)`th skewer, the program minimizes the number of actions while ensuring that all skewers are turned over. This approach works because it allows the program to cover all skewers with the least number of non-overlapping sets of skewers.

Since the program's logic is sound and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs, including the examples provided, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
