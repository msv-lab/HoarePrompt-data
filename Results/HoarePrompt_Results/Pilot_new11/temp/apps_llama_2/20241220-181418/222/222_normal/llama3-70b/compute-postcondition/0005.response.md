To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given For loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The For loop statement is `for i in range(l):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `l`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `l` is greater than 0
- `res` is a list containing the value 1
- `i` is 0
- `n + k - 1` is greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration) and `l` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 

So, the new state should be:
- `n` remains the same as it's not affected by the loop iteration
- `k` remains the same as it's not affected by the loop iteration
- `l` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again
- `res` remains the same as its state isn't affected by the loop's conditional execution
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1
- `n + k - 1` being greater than 0 is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition, so it remains a constant condition but doesn't influence the loop's next iteration directly.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is greater than 1, `res` is a list containing the value 1, `i` is 1, `n + k - 1` is greater than 0**
