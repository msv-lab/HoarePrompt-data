According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -1000. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1, so `x` is -999.
State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -999, `y` is 1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`**
