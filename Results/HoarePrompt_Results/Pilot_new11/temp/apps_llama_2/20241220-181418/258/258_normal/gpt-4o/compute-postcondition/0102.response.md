The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables, but it skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables are not changed, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `j` is 3, `x1` is `meats[3][0]`, `y1` is `meats[3][1]`, `c1` is `meats[3][2]`, `x2` is `meats[1][0]`, `y2` is `meats[1][1]`, `c2` is `meats[1][2]`, otherwise `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` retain their original values, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` may need to be updated based on the new `j`, `count` is the number of points in `meats` where the condition is met, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
