The code `x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]` affects the variables `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` by assigning them the values of the triple at index `j` in the `meats` list. Given that `j` is 3, this means `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are assigned the values of `meats[3][0]`, `meats[3][1]`, and `meats[3][2]` respectively.

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code, so they retain their initial values or conditions, except for variables that may need to be updated based on the new `j`, such as `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my`. However, without specific update instructions for these variables in the provided code snippet, their values remain as they were, with the understanding that they "may need to be updated based on the new `j`", which is 3.

Thus, `x2` is `meats[3][0]`, `y2` is `meats[3][1]`, and `c2` is `meats[3][2]`. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1` is `meats[1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[3][0]`, `y2` is `meats[3][1]`, `c2` is `meats[3][2]`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` may need to be updated based on the new `j`, `count` is the number of points in `meats` where the condition is met**
