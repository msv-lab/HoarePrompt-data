Postcondition: ***`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, the program continues to the next iteration, maintaining the current state of variables.***
