The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there is no loop provided in the given code, we assume it is part of a larger loop structure not shown here. 

Given that, the `continue` statement itself doesn't modify any variables directly; it merely controls the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of the loop it's embedded within.

Therefore, the state of all variables remains unchanged: `meats` is still a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is still a positive integer, `T` is still a positive real number, `N` is still greater than 5, `i` is still 2, `j` is still 5, the condition regarding `c1 * T < c2 * T` and its effect on `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` remains as it was (since no new information or change to `c1`, `c2`, or `T` has been provided), and all calculated variables (`d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`) retain their values based on the original conditions.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the values of the triple at `meats[2]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[5]` and the values of the triple at `meats[5]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[2]`; otherwise, the state of `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` remains unchanged, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
