Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my` are calculated based on the last iteration, `count` is either the final sum or the value leading to early return if `count >= K`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then the second and third triples in `meats` are swapped, resulting in `x1`, `y1`, `c1` being the original `x2`, `y2`, `c2` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` being the original `x1`, `y1`, `c1`.***
