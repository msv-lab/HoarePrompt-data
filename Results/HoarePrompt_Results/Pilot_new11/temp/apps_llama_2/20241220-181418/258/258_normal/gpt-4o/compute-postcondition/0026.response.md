The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but based on the given constraints, it is expected to operate on some input data. 

However, to adhere to the constraints, let's re-evaluate the problem: If the function `func_3` is supposed to operate on the given constraints (N, K, and data), it should accept these parameters. 

The function `func_3` would accept parameters N and K, where N is a positive integer between 1 and 60, and K is a positive integer between 1 and N. It also accepts a list of strings `data`, where the first two elements can be converted to integers N and K, and the rest of the list can be converted to a list of 3-tuples (x, y, c) where x, y, and c can be converted to integers between -1000 and 1000, -1000 and 1000, and 1 and 100 respectively.

However, as per the given code `def func_3():`, the function does not accept any parameters. Therefore, we can only describe the expected input parameters based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function is expected to operate on input parameters N, K, and data, where N is a positive integer between 1 and 60, K is a positive integer between 1 and N, and data is a list of strings with specific conversion rules, but the actual function definition does not accept any parameters.**
