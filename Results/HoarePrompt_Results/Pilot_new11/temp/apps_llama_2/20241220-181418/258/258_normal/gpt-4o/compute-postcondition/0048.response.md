According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `N` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 3. Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, for `j` to be 3, `i` can be at most 2. 

State: **`meats` is a list of triples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3**
