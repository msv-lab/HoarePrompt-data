Functionality: **The function reads input from the user, parses it into integers N, K, and a list of 3-tuples (x, y, c), then calls another function `func_2` with these parameters and prints the result. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking. After the function concludes, the program state will be updated with the parsed integers N and K, and the list of 3-tuples (x, y, c) from the input, and the result of `func_2(N, K, meats)` will be printed to the console with six decimal places. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer input, or input that does not match the expected format. If the input is malformed, the function may raise an exception or produce unexpected results. The function also does not check if the integers N, K, x, y, and c are within the expected ranges, which could lead to further errors if `func_2` relies on these ranges.**
