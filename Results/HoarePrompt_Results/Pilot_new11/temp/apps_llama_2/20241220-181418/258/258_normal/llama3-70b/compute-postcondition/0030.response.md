According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. Since the loop is defined as `for y in range(-1000, 1001):`, it will iterate over all integers from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. 

Before the loop starts, `y` is 1000, which is the last value it would take in the loop. For the loop to execute, `y` should start from -1000. 

The other variables `K`, `N`, `ans`, `x`, and `times` do not directly impact the execution of the loop, but their states should be preserved as given.

State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` for all `y` from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`**
