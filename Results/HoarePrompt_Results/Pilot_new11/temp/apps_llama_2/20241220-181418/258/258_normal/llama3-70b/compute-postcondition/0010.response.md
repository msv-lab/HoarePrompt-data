According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999, so for the loop to execute again, `y` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`**
