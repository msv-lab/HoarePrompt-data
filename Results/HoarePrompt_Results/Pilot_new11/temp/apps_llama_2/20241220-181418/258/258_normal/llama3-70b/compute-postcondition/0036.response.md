The code snippet provided is `times.sort()`. 

Since `times` is already stated to be the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, the operation `times.sort()` does not change the value of `times`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its old value and the old `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -998, `y` is -999, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its old value and the old `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -998, `y` is -999, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)**
