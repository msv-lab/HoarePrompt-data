To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

The initial state is:
- `N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.
- `K` is a positive integer between 1 and the old value of `N`.
- `data` is a list of strings from user input.

The code given is:
```python
K = int(data[1])
```
This line of code updates the value of `K` by converting the second element of the `data` list to an integer.

The impact of this code on the program is that it changes the value of `K`. The previous value of `K` was a positive integer between 1 and the old value of `N`, but now `K` is directly assigned the value of `int(data[1])`.

Given this, the output state is:
- `N` remains an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, as its value was not changed by the code.
- `K` is now an integer equal to `int(data[1])`. This means `K`'s value is no longer constrained to be between 1 and the old value of `N` based on the code's execution alone, but its new value is determined by the user's input stored in `data[1]`.
- `data` remains a list of strings from user input, as the code did not modify `data`, only used its elements to update `K`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `K` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, and `data` is a list of strings from user input.**
