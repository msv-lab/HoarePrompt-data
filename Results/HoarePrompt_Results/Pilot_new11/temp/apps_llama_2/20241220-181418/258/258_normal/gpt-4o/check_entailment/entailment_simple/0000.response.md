Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input according to the problem description. It reads the number of pieces of meat `N`, the minimum number of pieces to be ready `K`, and the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat.

2. **Binary Search**: The program uses a binary search approach to find the minimum time required to have at least `K` pieces of meat ready. It starts with a wide range `[0, 1000000000.0]` and gradually narrows it down until the difference between the upper and lower bounds is less than `1e-07`. This ensures that the result is accurate to within the required precision.

3. **Checking Feasibility**: The `func_1` function checks whether it is possible to have at least `K` pieces of meat ready within a given time `T`. It iterates over all pairs of pieces of meat and calculates the midpoint of the line segment connecting them. It then checks whether the pieces of meat can be ready within the given time `T` if the heat source is placed at this midpoint.

4. **Calculating Midpoint**: The program correctly calculates the midpoint of the line segment connecting two pieces of meat based on the condition `c1 * T - c2 * T = d`. This condition ensures that the pieces of meat at the two endpoints of the line segment can be ready within the given time `T` if the heat source is placed at the calculated midpoint.

5. **Counting Ready Pieces**: The program correctly counts the number of pieces of meat that can be ready within the given time `T` if the heat source is placed at a certain point. It uses the formula `c * sqrt((mx - x) ** 2 + (my - y) ** 2)` to calculate the time required to cook each piece of meat.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. It handles the input correctly, uses a binary search approach to find the minimum time required, and correctly checks whether it is possible to have at least `K` pieces of meat ready within a given time. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
