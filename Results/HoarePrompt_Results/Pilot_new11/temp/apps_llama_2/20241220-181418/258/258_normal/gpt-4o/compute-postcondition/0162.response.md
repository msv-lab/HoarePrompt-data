Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is a positive integer at least 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the triple at `meats[2]` or `meats[3]` based on the condition, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the triple at `meats[3]` or `meats[2]` based on the condition, `d` is `T * (1/c1 - 1/c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and the current value of `count` is the sum of all instances where `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)` is met, and `count` is greater than or equal to `K`.**
