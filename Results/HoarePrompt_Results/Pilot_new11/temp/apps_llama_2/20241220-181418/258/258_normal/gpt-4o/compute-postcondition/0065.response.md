The code defines a new variable `my` and assigns it the value of `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. 

Here, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`.

Also, notice that `d2 * d - d * d` is equivalent to `d2 * d - d^2` or `d * (d2 - d)`.

So, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected, so their values remain the same.

The initial conditions that `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, and `d > 1` are still valid.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`K` is a positive integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is at least 3, 
`i` is at most 2, 
`j` is 3, 
`meats` is a list of triples, 
`d` is equal to `T*(1/c2 - 1/c1)`, 
`cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` is equal to `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is equal to `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, 
`mx` is equal to `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, 
`my` is equal to `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, 
and `d > 1`.
