To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables. The code is `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])`. 

Given that `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `x` is -998, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, we can infer the following:

- The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `ans` initially is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`, this operation essentially ensures that `ans` remains the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`.
- The values of `K`, `N`, `x`, `y`, and `times` are not changed by the given code.
- The sorted nature of `times` implies that its elements are in ascending order, but without knowing the specific values returned by `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, we can't determine the exact value of `times[K - 1]`. However, we know that `ans` will be updated to the smallest value between its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

Thus, after executing the given code, the output state remains largely the same as the initial state, with the exception that `ans` is now confirmed to be the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`, which might have resulted in a change to `ans` if `times[K - 1]` was smaller than its previous minimum value.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -998, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`**
