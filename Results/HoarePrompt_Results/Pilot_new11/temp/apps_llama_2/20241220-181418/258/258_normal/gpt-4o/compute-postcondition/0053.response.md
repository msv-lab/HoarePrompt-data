The code calculates the difference between `c1 * T` and `c2 * T` and assigns it to `d`. The values of `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, and `meats` are not affected by this calculation. 

The value of `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`. 

The precondition that `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, and `meats` is a list of triples is still valid.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is at most 2, `j` is 3, `meats` is a list of triples, `d` is equal to `c1 * T - c2 * T`**
