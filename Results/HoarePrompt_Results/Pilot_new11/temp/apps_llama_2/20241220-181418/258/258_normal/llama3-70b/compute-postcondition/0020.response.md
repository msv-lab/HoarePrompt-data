According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1. So, `y` becomes -999. Other variables remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop condition.
State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -999, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`**
