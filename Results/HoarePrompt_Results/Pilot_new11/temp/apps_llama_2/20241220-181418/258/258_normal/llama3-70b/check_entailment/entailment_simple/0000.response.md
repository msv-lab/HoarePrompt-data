Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for several reasons:

1. In `func_2`, the function is supposed to take four parameters `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, where `x` and `y` are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the pieces of meat, and `X` and `Y` are the coordinates of the heat source. However, in the given implementation, it only takes two parameters `x` and `y`, which are used as lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the pieces of meat, and the heat source coordinates are also set to `x` and `y`. This means that the heat source and the meat pieces have the same coordinates, which is not what the problem description intended.

2. In `func_3`, the function iterates over all possible integer coordinates of the heat source in the range `-1000` to `1000`. However, the problem description states that `X` and `Y` are real numbers, not integers. This means that the function is not considering all possible locations for the heat source, only a discrete subset of them.

3. In `func_3`, the function uses `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to calculate the times for each piece of meat, where `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the heat source and the meat pieces. However, as mentioned earlier, `func_2` should take four parameters `x`, `y`, `X`, and `Y`, not just two.

4. The problem description asks for the time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready if the heat source is placed to minimize this time. However, the given implementation does not actually minimize the time; it simply returns the minimum time found after iterating over all possible integer coordinates of the heat source.

To fix these issues, the program would need to be modified to correctly implement the problem description. This would involve changing `func_2` to take four parameters, using real numbers for the heat source coordinates, and implementing a minimization algorithm to find the optimal location for the heat source. 

Here is a simplified and corrected version of the code, although it may still have some performance issues due to its brute-force nature:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)

def func_2(meats, X, Y):
    return [c * func_1(x, y, X, Y) for x, y, c in meats]

def func_3(meats, K):
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in np.arange(-1000, 1001, 0.1):
        for y in np.arange(-1000, 1001, 0.1):
            times = func_2(meats, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
    return ans

N, K = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    x, y, c = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3(meats, K))
```
This version of the code uses `numpy` to generate an array of real numbers for the heat source coordinates, and it corrects the `func_2` function to take four parameters. However, please note that this code may still have performance issues due to its brute-force nature.
