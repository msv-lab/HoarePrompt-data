Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the minimum time value at index K-1 from the list of times, considering all possible coordinates (x, y) ranging from -1000 to 1000, where K is a positive integer between 1 and N. The function assumes that N is a positive integer representing the total number of pieces of meat and that the functions func_2 and sorting are properly defined to process the times for each piece of meat at given coordinates. The function iterates over all possible coordinates, calculates the times using the func_2 function, sorts the times, and keeps track of the minimum time value at index K-1. The function returns this minimum time value. The state of the program after execution includes the minimum time value stored in the variable ans, which is the minimum of all times[K-1] values for all x and y coordinates. The function does not modify any external state or input variables. Potential edge cases include the functions func_2 and sorting not being properly defined, K being outside the range of 1 to N, or N being a non-positive integer. However, these edge cases are not explicitly handled within the provided code.**
