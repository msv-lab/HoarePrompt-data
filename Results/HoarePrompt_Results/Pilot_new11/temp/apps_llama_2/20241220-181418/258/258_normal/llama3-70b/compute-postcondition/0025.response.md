To determine the output state, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program.

The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` updates the value of `times` by calling the function `func_2` with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. 

Given that `x` is -999 and `y` is -998, we substitute these values into the function call: `times = func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`.

The initial state mentions that `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`. However, with the new function call, `times` will now hold the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`.

The states of the other variables (`K`, `N`, `ans`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum and `times[K - 1]`, `x` is -999, `y` is -998, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`**
