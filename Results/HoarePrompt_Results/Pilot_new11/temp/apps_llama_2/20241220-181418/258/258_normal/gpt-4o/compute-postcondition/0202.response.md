To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but the code only updates the variable `mx`. The value of `mx` is calculated using the formula `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

From the initial state, we know that `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, 
`K` is a positive integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is greater than 5, 
`i` is 2, 
`j` is 5, 
if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the values of the triple at `meats[2]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[5]` and the values of the triple at `meats[5]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[2]`; 
otherwise, the state of `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` remains unchanged, 
`d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, 
`cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, 
`mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of triples with `meats[0]` potentially modified, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the values of the triple at `meats[2]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[5]` and the values of the triple at `meats[5]` are the original values of the triple at `meats[2]`; otherwise, the state of `meats[2]` and `meats[5]` remains unchanged, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
