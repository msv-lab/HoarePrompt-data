To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The initial state includes:
- `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` is a positive integer.
- `ans` is the minimum of all `times[K - 1]` values for `y` ranging from -1000 to 1000.
- `x` is -999.
- `y` is 1000.
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`.

The loop code iterates over `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive), and for each `y`, it:
1. Calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)` and assigns the result to `times`.
2. Sorts `times`.
3. Updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe patterns:
- `x` remains constant at -999.
- `y` increments from -1000 towards 1000 with each iteration.
- `times` is updated based on the call to `func_2` with the current `x` and `y`.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the `K-1`th element of the sorted `times`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `y` will have iterated from -1000 to 1000. Thus, `y` will be 1000.

Since `ans` is updated at each iteration to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`, after all iterations, `ans` will hold the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.

The loop will execute if the initial conditions are met (i.e., `K` and `N` are positive integers, and `1 <= K <= N`). If these conditions are not met, the loop may not execute as expected or may not execute at all, but based on the given initial state, we assume these conditions are met.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
- `K` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` remains a positive integer.
- `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` across all `y` from -1000 to 1000.
- `x` remains -999.
- `y` is 1000.
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`.

Output State: **`K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` for all `y` from -1000 to 1000, `x` is -999, `y` is 1000, and `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`.**
