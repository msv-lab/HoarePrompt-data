The value of `examples[i]` is updated to be the string representation of `temp_counter`. The previous value of `examples[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, but this condition is no longer relevant after the update. Other variables are not affected by this code.

Given that `temp_counter` is the minimum value greater than `n` for which `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` or `2 * n + 1` if all string representations from `n + 1` to `2 * n` are in `files_set`, `examples[i]` now holds this string representation of `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `temp_counter` is the minimum value greater than `n` for which `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` or `2 * n + 1` if all string representations from `n + 1` to `2 * n` are in `files_set`, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames where the filename at index `i` is now `str(temp_counter)`, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is a list containing the string f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter}', `i` is 0**
