The given code appends a new string to the `moves` list. This string is a formatted string that includes the values of `regulars[i]` and `temp_counter`. 

The new string is in the format 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}', where {regulars[i]} is replaced with the value of `regulars` at index `i` and {temp_counter} is replaced with the value of `temp_counter`.

Other variables `n`, `files`, `examples`, `target`, and `i` are not affected by this operation, and their states remain the same as before the operation.

`files_set` is also not affected by this operation.

The state of `temp_counter` is also not affected by this operation, it remains the smallest value greater than its initial value such that either `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`.

The only change is in `moves`, which now has an additional element.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than its initial value such that either `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `files`, `examples`, `target`, and `i` are as updated by operations outside this loop or initially defined, and `moves` is updated with a new element 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'.**
