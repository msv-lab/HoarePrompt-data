Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`. The current value of `regulars` at index `i` (which is 0) is not equal to the string representation of `target`, meaning `regulars[0]` is not equal to `str(len(examples) + 1)`**
