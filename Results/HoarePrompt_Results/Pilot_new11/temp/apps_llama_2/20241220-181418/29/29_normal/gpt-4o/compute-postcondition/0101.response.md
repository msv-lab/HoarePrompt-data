Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, if `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `moves` includes an additional move operation 'move {regulars[i]} {target}', otherwise no changes are made to `moves`, and `i` and `target` remain unchanged, with `regulars`, `temp_counter` updated accordingly based on the initial state description.**
