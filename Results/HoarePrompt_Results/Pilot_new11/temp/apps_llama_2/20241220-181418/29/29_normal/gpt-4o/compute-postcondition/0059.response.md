The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, so the new value of `temp_counter` will be less than or equal to `2 * n + 1` but still the string representation of `temp_counter`'s new value must be in `files_set`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2, `temp_counter`'s value is incremented by 1, is less than or equal to `2 * n + 1`, and the string representation of `temp_counter`'s new value must be in `files_set`**
