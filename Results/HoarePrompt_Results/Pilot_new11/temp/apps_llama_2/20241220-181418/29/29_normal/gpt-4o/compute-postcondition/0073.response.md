The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was greater than or equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 2`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter - 1`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 2`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter - 1`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 2`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1**
