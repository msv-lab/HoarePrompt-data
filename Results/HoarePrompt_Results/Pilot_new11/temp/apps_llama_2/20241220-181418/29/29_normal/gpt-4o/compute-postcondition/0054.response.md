According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter` and `n`, and the condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set`. If `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `temp_counter` is one more than the smallest integer greater than its previous value that exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not in `files_set`. 

To ensure that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `temp_counter`'s previous value must be less than `2 * n` so that when we add 1 to it, it will also be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` is one more than the smallest integer greater than its previous value that exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not in `files_set`, for it to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, its previous value's string representation must be in `files_set` and it must not exceed `2 * n`. 

Also, `str(temp_counter)` needs to be in `files_set`. Since `temp_counter` is one more than the smallest integer greater than its previous value that exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not in `files_set`, if its previous value's string representation is in `files_set`, then `temp_counter` will be the smallest integer greater than its previous value whose string representation is not in `files_set`, unless its previous value exceeds `2 * n`. But we've established that its previous value cannot exceed `2 * n` if we want `temp_counter` to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Therefore, for `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`, `temp_counter` must be the smallest integer greater than its previous value that exceeds `2 * n` is not possible, so its previous value's string representation must be in `files_set` but there must be a value between its previous value and `2 * n` (inclusive) whose string representation is in `files_set` and that is `temp_counter`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2, if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `moves` contains its updated value based on `examples[0]` and 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}' and also contains 'move {examples[2]} {3}', `temp_counter`'s previous value's string representation is in `files_set` and does not exceed `2 * n` and there is a value between `temp_counter`'s previous value and `2 * n` (inclusive) whose string representation is in `files_set` and that is `temp_counter`, `examples[2]` is the string representation of the previous value of `temp_counter`; otherwise, `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1' and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`, otherwise `moves` remains empty**
