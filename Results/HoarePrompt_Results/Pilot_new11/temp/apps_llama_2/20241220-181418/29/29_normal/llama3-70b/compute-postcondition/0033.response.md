To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each `line` in the `script`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more line in the `script` after the current `line`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `files` is a list of `n` tuples, each containing a distinct string of digits and small English letters, and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value.
   - `examples` is a list of strings.
   - `regular` is a list of strings.
   - `script` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 line, and its length equals the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`.
   - `line` is the first line in the `script`, and its value has been printed.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `line` is currently the first line in the `script`, for the loop to execute again, `line` must become the second line in the `script`.
   - The length of `script` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time because it needs to have at least one more line after the first line.
   - The relationship between the lengths of `script`, `examples`, and `regular` must remain consistent, meaning the length of `script` is equal to the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`.
   - `n`, `files`, `examples`, and `regular` do not directly influence the loop's execution condition, which solely depends on the existence of lines in `script`. Therefore, their states do not need adjustment based on the loop condition itself, but their descriptions remain part of the overall state.

Given these considerations:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 lines, and the length of `script` equals the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`, `line` is the second line in the `script`**
