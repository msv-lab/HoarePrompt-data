The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was such that its string representation was in `files_set` and did not exceed `2 * n`, and there was a value between `temp_counter`'s previous value and `2 * n` (inclusive) whose string representation was in `files_set` and that was `temp_counter`. Since `temp_counter` has been incremented by 1, its new value is `temp_counter + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, 
`files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, 
`examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, 
`regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', 
`i` equals 2, 
if `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `moves` contains its updated value based on `examples[0]` and 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}' and also contains 'move {examples[2]} {3}', 
`temp_counter`'s previous value's string representation is in `files_set` and does not exceed `2 * n` and there is a value between `temp_counter`'s previous value and `2 * n` (inclusive) whose string representation is in `files_set` and that is `temp_counter`, 
`examples[2]` is the string representation of the previous value of `temp_counter`; 
otherwise, `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1' and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`, otherwise `moves` remains empty, 
`temp_counter` equals `temp_counter + 1`.

However, we should simplify the `temp_counter` expression: 
`temp_counter` equals its old value plus 1.
