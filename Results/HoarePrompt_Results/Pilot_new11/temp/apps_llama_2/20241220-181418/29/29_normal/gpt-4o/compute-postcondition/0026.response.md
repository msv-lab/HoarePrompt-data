To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**  
   At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, we need to ensure that `n + 2 <= 2 * n`. This simplifies to `n >= 2`. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, we just need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for this condition to potentially be true in the next iteration, considering `temp_counter` will increase.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**  
   The current value of `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, and its string representation must be in `files_set` for the loop to execute again. Since `str(n + 2)` must already be in `files_set` as per the given state, we need to ensure that the next value of `temp_counter` (which would be `n + 3`) also has its string representation in `files_set` for the loop to potentially execute again.

Given these considerations:

- `n` must be at least 2 to satisfy the first condition when `temp_counter` increases.
- The string representation of the next `temp_counter` value (`n + 3`) must be in `files_set`.

Other states like `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `moves`, and `i` do not directly affect the `while` loop condition, so they do not need adjustment based on the information provided about the loop condition itself.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 2`, `i` is 0, the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, `str(n + 2)` and `str(n + 3)` must be in `files_set`**
