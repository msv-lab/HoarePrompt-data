To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code. The loop code simply prints each line in the `script`. The output states after the loop executes some number of times provide hints about the relationships between the variables.

1. **`n`**: Remains a non-negative integer throughout the execution.
2. **`files`**: A list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value. This does not change during the loop execution.
3. **`examples` and `regular`**: Lists of strings. Their lengths are related to the length of `script`, but the loop does not modify them.
4. **`script`**: A list of strings. The length of `script` equals the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`. The loop iterates over each line in `script` and prints it.
5. **`line`**: Takes the value of each line in `script` during each iteration. After the loop finishes, `line` would be the last line in `script` if `script` is not empty.

The key points to consider for the output state after all iterations are:
- The loop's execution does not alter `n`, `files`, `examples`, or `regular`.
- The loop's primary action is printing each line in `script`.
- If `script` is empty, the loop does not execute, and none of the variables change their initial values.

Therefore, considering the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list of strings that has been fully printed, and if `script` is not empty, `line` is the last line in `script`, otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.**
