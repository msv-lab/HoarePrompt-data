The code creates a new list `regular` that contains the first elements of the tuples in `files` where the second element is 0. The `files` list remains unchanged as it is only being iterated over, not modified. The `examples` list also remains unchanged because it is not referenced in the code. 

The initial state described `n` as a non-negative integer, `files` as a list of `n` tuples, and `examples` as a list of strings where each string corresponds to a tuple in `files` with an integer value of 1. After executing the given code, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `files` remains a list of `n` tuples (sorted in descending order based on the integer value), and `examples` remains a list of strings. The new list `regular` is created, containing strings that are the first elements of tuples in `files` where the integer value is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters (length from 1 to 6 characters) and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings where each string is the first element of a tuple in `files` with an integer value of 1, `regular` is a list of strings where each string is the first element of a tuple in `files` with an integer value of 0**
