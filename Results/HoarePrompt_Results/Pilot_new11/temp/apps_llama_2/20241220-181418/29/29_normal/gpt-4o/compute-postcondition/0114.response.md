Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, if `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `moves` includes an additional move operation 'move {regulars[i+1]} {target}', otherwise no changes are made to `moves`. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, and `moves` is updated with a new element 'move {str(temp_counter)} {temp_counter}'. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
