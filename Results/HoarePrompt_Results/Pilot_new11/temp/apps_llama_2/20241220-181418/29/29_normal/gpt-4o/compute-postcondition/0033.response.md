The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `temp_counter` is the minimum value greater than `n` for which `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` or `2 * n + 1` if all string representations from `n + 1` to `2 * n` are in `files_set` and then incremented by 1, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames where the filename at index `i` is now `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is a list containing the string f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}', `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames where the filename at index `i` is now `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is a list containing the string f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}', `i` is 0**
