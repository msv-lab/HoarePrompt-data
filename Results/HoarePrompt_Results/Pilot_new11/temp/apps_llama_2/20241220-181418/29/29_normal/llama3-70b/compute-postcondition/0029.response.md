To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the initial state.

The loop code is:
```python
for i, file in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
```

From this loop, we can observe the following:

1. The loop iterates over the `regular` list of strings, with `i` starting from `len(examples) + 1`. This means `i` will always be at least one more than the number of elements in `examples`.
2. For each iteration, the loop appends a string in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` to the `script` list, where `file` is the current element being iterated over in `regular`.
3. The loop does not modify `n`, `files`, or `examples`. It only modifies `script`.
4. If `regular` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `script` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, let's consider the possible scenarios for the output state:

- If `regular` is not empty, the loop will execute for each element in `regular`, appending the corresponding `move` commands to `script`. The index `i` will range from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + len(regular)`.
- If `regular` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the state of the variables remains as in the initial state, with `script` containing only the move commands for `examples` if `examples` is not empty, or an empty list if `examples` is empty.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `files` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `examples` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `regular` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop, though its elements are iterated over.
- `script` will contain all the `move` commands for `examples` (if any) plus the `move` commands for each element in `regular`, with indices starting from `len(examples) + 1`.

Considering the original values and how they might affect the current state, we keep in mind that `script`'s initial state could contain commands based on `examples`, but its final state is determined by both `examples` and `regular`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, and `script` contains strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `examples` with `i` ranging from 1 to the length of `examples`, and for each `file` in `regular` with `i` ranging from `len(examples) + 1` to `len(examples) + len(regular)` if `regular` is not empty, or remains as in the initial state if `regular` is empty.**
