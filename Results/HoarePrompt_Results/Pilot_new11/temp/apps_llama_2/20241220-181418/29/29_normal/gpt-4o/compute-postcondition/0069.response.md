According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `regulars` list. If the list has at least 1 filename, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `regulars` is not empty and `i` is 0, which is the starting index for the loop. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, and `i` is 0**
