To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`: Given that `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, for this condition to hold true for the next iteration, `n + 3` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. This implies `n >= 3` for the loop to potentially execute again, but since `n` can be any integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, we focus on ensuring the upper limit does not prevent another iteration.

2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`: For this condition to be true, since `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, `str(n + 3)` must be in `files_set`. Given that `str(n + 2)` and `str(n + 3)` must already be in `files_set`, this condition can hold true for the next iteration if we adjust `temp_counter` to be such that its string representation is also in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` is `n + 3`, to ensure the loop can execute again:
- `temp_counter` needs to be incremented (as it will be in the next iteration) and still satisfy `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.
- The string representation of the new `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `temp_counter` being `n + 3` doesn't immediately limit the loop from executing again based on `n`'s range alone. The critical condition is ensuring `str(temp_counter)` (after incrementing `temp_counter`) is in `files_set`.

The state adjustments consider the increment of `temp_counter` and the necessity for its string representation to be in `files_set`. However, without explicit information on how `files_set` is updated or populated beyond containing `str(n + 2)` and `str(n + 3)`, we focus on the conditions that must hold for the next iteration:

- `temp_counter` (which becomes `n + 4` after increment) must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, which is inherently satisfied given `n`'s range and the condition that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `str(temp_counter)` (which becomes `str(n + 4)`) must be in `files_set` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is a list, `temp_counter` is `n + 4`, `i` is 0, the current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, `str(n + 2)`, `str(n + 3)`, and `str(n + 4)` must be in `files_set`**
