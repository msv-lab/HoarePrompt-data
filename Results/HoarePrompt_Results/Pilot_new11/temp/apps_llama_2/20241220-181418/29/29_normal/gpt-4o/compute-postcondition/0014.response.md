According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `files` list. If the list has at least 3 files, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `files` has at least 2 files, `file` is the second file in the list, `name` is the first part of the second `file`, and `type_` is the second part of the second `file`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `files` must have at least 3 files. Since `file` is the second file in the list, for the next iteration, `file` should be the third file in the list. 

`name` should be the first part of the third `file`, and `type_` should be the second part of the third `file`. 

If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` at least twice and `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing `name` at least twice.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 files, `file` is the third file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the third `file`, `type_` is the second part of the third `file`. If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` at least twice and `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing `name` at least twice.**
