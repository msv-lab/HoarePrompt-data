Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are some reasons why:

1.  **Incorrect Splitting of Files**: The line `name, type_ = file.split()` is incorrect. The `files` variable is a list of strings where each string contains a filename and a type separated by a space. However, when the input is read from `sys.stdin.read()`, it is split into a list of strings using the newline character as the delimiter. Therefore, each `file` in `files` is a string containing a filename and a type separated by a space, and the `split()` method should be used with no arguments to split it into a list of two elements.

2.  **Redundant Loops and Moves**: The provided code has redundant loops and move operations. The code first checks if an example file's name matches its expected numeric filename and performs a move operation if necessary. Then, it performs another move operation to rename the file to its expected numeric filename. However, the first move operation is unnecessary and can be removed.

3.  **Incorrect Handling of Regular Files**: The code uses the same approach to handle regular files, which is incorrect. Regular files should be renamed to their expected numeric filenames in one step, without the need for a temporary move operation.

4.  **Lack of Error Handling**: Although the problem statement assumes valid input, a correct program should still handle potential errors, such as invalid input formats or out-of-range values.

5.  **Naming Convention**: The function name `func_1` is not descriptive. It should be renamed to something more meaningful, such as `generate_move_commands`.

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split('\n')
n = int(data[0])
files = [file.split() for file in data[1:n + 1]]
files_set = set(file[0] for file in files)
examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == '1']
regulars = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == '0']

moves = []
temp_counter = n + 1

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    if example!= str(i + 1):
        while str(temp_counter) in files_set:
            temp_counter += 1
        moves.append(f'move {example} {temp_counter}')
        examples[i] = str(temp_counter)
        files_set.remove(example)
        files_set.add(str(temp_counter))
        temp_counter += 1
        moves.append(f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {i + 1}')
        files_set.remove(str(temp_counter - 1))
        files_set.add(str(i + 1))

for i, regular in enumerate(regulars):
    target = len(examples) + i + 1
    if regular!= str(target):
        while str(temp_counter) in files_set:
            temp_counter += 1
        moves.append(f'move {regular} {temp_counter}')
        regulars[i] = str(temp_counter)
        files_set.remove(regular)
        files_set.add(str(temp_counter))
        temp_counter += 1
        moves.append(f'move {str(temp_counter - 1)} {target}')
        files_set.remove(str(temp_counter - 1))
        files_set.add(str(target))

print(len(moves))
for move in moves:
    print(move)
```

This corrected code follows the problem description and handles the renaming of files correctly. It separates the files into examples and regulars, renames them to their expected numeric filenames, and generates a list of move commands for the updated filenames.
