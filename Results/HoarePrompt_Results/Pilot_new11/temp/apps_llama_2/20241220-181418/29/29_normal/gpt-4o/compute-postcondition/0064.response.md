Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 3, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `i` equals 2. If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `temp_counter` is updated to be one more than the smallest integer greater than its previous value that exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not in `files_set`, `examples[2]` is the string representation of the previous value of `temp_counter`, and `moves` contains its updated value based on `examples[0]` and 'move {examples[2]} {temp_counter}' and also contains 'move {examples[2]} {3}'; otherwise, if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1', `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 1}'` if `temp_counter` was updated, and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'` if `temp_counter` was not updated, and `temp_counter` remains unchanged if `examples[i]` equals `str(i + 1)`.***
