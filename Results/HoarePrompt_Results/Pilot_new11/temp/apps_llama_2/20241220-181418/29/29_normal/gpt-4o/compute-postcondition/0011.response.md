The given code appends `name` to the `examples` list. The initial state of `examples` depends on the value of `type_`. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` initially contains `name`. If `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is initially empty.

After executing the code, `examples` will contain `name` at least once. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` will contain `name` at least twice because it already contained `name` initially. If `type_` is not '1', then `examples` will contain `name` exactly once because it was initially empty.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 files, `file` is the second file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the second `file`, `type_` is the second part of the second `file`. If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` at least twice and `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` exactly once and `regulars` is a list containing `name`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 files, `file` is the second file in the `files` list, `name` is the first part of the second `file`, `type_` is the second part of the second `file`. If `type_` is equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` at least twice and `regulars` is an empty list. If `type_` is not equal to '1', then `examples` is a list containing `name` exactly once and `regulars` is a list containing `name`.**
