The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The input consists of a single integer `n`, which is the number of lines that will follow. 

The initial state also specifies that `n` lines will follow, each containing a string and an integer, but these lines have not been processed yet. The code only reads the first integer `n` from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, the input consists of `n` lines, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct.**
