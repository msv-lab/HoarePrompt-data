The code initializes a new empty list `script`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `files`, `examples`, or `regular`. 

So, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters (length from 1 to 6 characters) and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings where each string is the first element of a tuple in `files` with an integer value of 1, `regular` is a list of strings where each string is the first element of a tuple in `files` with an integer value of 0, and `script` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters (length from 1 to 6 characters) and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings where each string is the first element of a tuple in `files` with an integer value of 1, `regular` is a list of strings where each string is the first element of a tuple in `files` with an integer value of 0, and `script` is an empty list.**
