According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `examples`. If `examples` has at least 1 filename, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`. For the loop to be executed, the list `examples` must have at least 1 filename and `i` is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, `i` is 0**
