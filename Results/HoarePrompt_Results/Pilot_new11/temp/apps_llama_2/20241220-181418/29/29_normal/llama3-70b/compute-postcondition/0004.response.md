The code appends a tuple to the `files` list. The tuple contains the `name` and the integer value of `type_`. 

The initial state is: `n` is greater than 0, the input consists of `n-1` lines, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct, `files` is an empty list, `name` is the first string from the input, `type_` is the first type from the input.

After executing the code, the `files` list will contain one tuple with the `name` and the integer value of `type_`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, the input consists of `n-1` lines, each containing a string and an integer, where the integer is either 0 or 1, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct, `files` is a list containing one tuple (`name`, `int(type_)`), `name` is the first string from the input, `type_` is the first type from the input**
