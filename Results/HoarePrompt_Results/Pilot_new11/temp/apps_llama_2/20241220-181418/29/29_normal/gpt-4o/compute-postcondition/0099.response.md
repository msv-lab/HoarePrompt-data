Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename. The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, which means that `regulars` will be updated where `regulars[i]` equals `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `temp_counter` will be incremented by 1, and `moves` will be updated with the new move operation 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter - 1}', and `i` and `target` remain unchanged from their previous values.**
