A new list `examples` is created, containing the first elements (`file[0]`) of the tuples in `files` where the second element (`file[1]`) is equal to 1. The value of `n` and `files` are not changed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a string and an integer, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, all strings are distinct, and the tuples are sorted in descending order based on the integer value; `examples` is a list of strings, where each string is the first element of a tuple in `files` with an integer value of 1**
