The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was either `n + 3` or `n + 4`. Therefore, the new value of `temp_counter` is either `n + 4` or `n + 5`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a filename that is the string representation of `temp_counter`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' with a length of at least 2, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1', `temp_counter` is either `n + 4` or `n + 5`, `i` equals 1, and `moves` contains `f'move {examples[0]} {temp_counter - 2}'` if `examples[0]` was not equal to '1' and `f'move {examples[0]} {1}'`, otherwise `moves` remains empty**
