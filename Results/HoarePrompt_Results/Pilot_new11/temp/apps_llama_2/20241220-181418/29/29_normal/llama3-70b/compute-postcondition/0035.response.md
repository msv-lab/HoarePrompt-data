According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `script`. If the `script` has at least 3 lines, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `script` has at least 2 lines, `line` is the second line in the `script`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `script` must have at least 3 lines and the `line` is the third line in the `script`.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 lines, the length of `script` equals the sum of the lengths of `examples` and `regular`, `line` is the third line in the `script`**
