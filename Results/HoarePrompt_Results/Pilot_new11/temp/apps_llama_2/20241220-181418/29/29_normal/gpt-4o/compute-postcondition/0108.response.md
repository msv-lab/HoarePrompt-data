To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the conditions of the `while` loop statement, which are `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5.
- `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter - 1)`.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename.
- `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`.
- `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and is one more than its previous value.
- `i` is as updated with `regulars`, `temp_counter - 2`, and `moves` accordingly.

For the loop to execute again, two conditions must be met:
1. `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` is one more than its previous value and is less than or equal to `2 * n`, we only need to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` (the new value after incrementing) is in `files_set` for the loop to execute again. This means the list of files must include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of the new `temp_counter` value. Since `files` already includes a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter - 1)`, to satisfy the condition for the next iteration, it must also include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter)`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- `n` remains the same.
- `files` must include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter)`.
- `examples`, `target`, and `i` do not directly impact the loop condition and thus do not need adjustment based on the given loop statement.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to `str(temp_counter)`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and is one more than its previous value, and `i` is as updated with `regulars`, `temp_counter - 2`, and `moves` accordingly**
