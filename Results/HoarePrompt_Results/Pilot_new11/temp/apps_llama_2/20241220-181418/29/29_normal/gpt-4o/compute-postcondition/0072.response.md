To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop:

1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`: This condition requires that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n`. Given that `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, this condition can be met because `n + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` for all positive integers `n`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `temp_counter` and `n` regarding this condition.

2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`: This condition requires that the string representation of `temp_counter` is present in `files_set`. The composition of `files_set` is not directly provided, but it is implied to be derived from `files`, which is a list of tuples containing filenames and types. For `str(temp_counter)` to be in `files_set`, it must correspond to a filename in `files`. Given that `temp_counter` starts at a value greater than or equal to `n + 1` and `n` is between 1 and 10^5, and considering that `target` (which equals `len(examples) + 1`) is not equal to `regulars[0]`, we need to ensure that there exists a filename that matches the string representation of `temp_counter`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that both conditions are met. The first condition is likely met given the initial conditions of `temp_counter` and `n`. The critical adjustment needed is to ensure that `str(temp_counter)` is indeed in `files_set`, which means there must be a tuple in `files` where the filename matches `str(temp_counter)`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a filename and a type and must include a tuple with a filename equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`, `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1' where each filename matches its expected numeric filename, `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' that must have at least 1 filename, `temp_counter` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `i` is 0, and `target` is `len(examples) + 1`**
