The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `temp_counter + 1`. The other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains unchanged, `files` does not change, `examples` does not change, `regulars` is updated where `regulars[i]` equals `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `i` does not change, `target` does not change, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, and `moves` is updated with the new move operation 'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter - 1}'.
