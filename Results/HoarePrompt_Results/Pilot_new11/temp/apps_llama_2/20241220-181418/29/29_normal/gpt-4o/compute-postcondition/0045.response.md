To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop's conditions and how the variables change.

The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and the string representation of `temp_counter` is in `files_set`. 

Given the initial state and the output states after a few iterations, we can see that:
- `n` remains constant throughout the loop.
- `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` do not change within the loop provided.
- `i` equals 1 initially but does not seem to change within the given loop code, so it remains 1.
- `moves` initially contains a specific move command based on `examples[0]`, but its value does not change within the loop provided.
- `temp_counter` starts as either `n + 1` or `n + 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration.

The loop will continue to increment `temp_counter` until it exceeds `2 * n` or the string representation of `temp_counter` is no longer in `files_set`. 

Thus, after all iterations, `temp_counter` will be the smallest value greater than `2 * n` or the value where its string representation is not in `files_set`, whichever comes first.

Given the constraints and the loop's behavior:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` remain unchanged.
- `i` remains 1.
- The initial value of `moves` is determined before the loop and does not change during the loop's execution.
- `temp_counter` will be the smallest integer greater than its initial value (either `n + 1` or `n + 2`) that either exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not found in `files_set`.

Output State: **`n` remains the original value, `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` are unchanged, `i` equals 1, `moves` contains its initial value based on `examples[0]`, and `temp_counter` is the smallest integer greater than its initial value (`n + 1` or `n + 2`) that exceeds `2 * n` or whose string representation is not in `files_set`.**
