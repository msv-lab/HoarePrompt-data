To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop statement: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, the condition for `n` does not need adjustment based on `temp_counter` being 3, because `3 <= 2 * n` will always be true given the range of `n`.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `'3'` is in `files_set`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `str(temp_counter)` (which is `'3'` when `temp_counter` is 3) must be in `files_set`.
   - Since `temp_counter` needs to increment for the loop to potentially execute again (given the condition that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`), `str(temp_counter + 1)` (i.e., `'4'`) must be in `files_set` for the loop to possibly execute again.

Based on the analysis:

- `n` does not need adjustment since `temp_counter` being 3 satisfies the condition for any possible value of `n` within its range.
- `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `i`, and `target` states are not directly relevant to the loop's condition.
- `temp_counter`'s state needs consideration because it must increment and still satisfy both conditions of the loop.
- `'3'` being in `files_set` is given, but for the loop to execute again, the next value, `'4'`, must also be in `files_set`.

**State:** **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5, `files` is a list of tuples where at least one tuple contains a filename '1' and '2' and potentially '3' and '4', `examples` is a list of filenames of type '1', `regulars` is a list of filenames not of type '1' with at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, `temp_counter` is 3, and '3' and '4' are in `files_set`**
