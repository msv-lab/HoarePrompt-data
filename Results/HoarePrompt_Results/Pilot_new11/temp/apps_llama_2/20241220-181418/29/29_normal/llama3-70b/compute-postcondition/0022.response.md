To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code iterates over the `examples` list, appending a string in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` to the `script` list, where `file` is the current element in `examples` and `i` is the current index plus one (due to `start=1` in `enumerate`).

Given the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can infer that:

- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `files` also remains unchanged as it is not accessed or modified within the loop.
- `examples` must have at least as many strings as the number of iterations the loop executes.
- `regular` is not modified within the loop, so its state remains unchanged.
- `script` is a list that accumulates strings of the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each iteration.
- `i` equals the number of the last iteration executed.
- `file` equals the last string processed from `examples`.

The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in the `examples` list. If `examples` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the `script` list will remain empty.

After all iterations, the `script` list will contain a string for each element in `examples`, in the format `f'move {file} {i}'`, where `i` ranges from 1 to the length of `examples`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains a distinct string of digits and small English letters and an integer, sorted in descending order by the integer value, `examples` is a list of strings, `regular` is a list of strings, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each `file` in `examples` with `i` ranging from 1 to the length of `examples`, or an empty list if `examples` is empty.**
