To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it reads a line from the input, splits it into a string `name` and an integer `type_`, and appends a tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the `files` list.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see a pattern:

- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The input consists of `n` lines, each containing a string and an integer.
- The `files` list contains tuples of `(name, int(type_))` for each line processed.

Considering the loop will execute `n` times, after all iterations, the `files` list will contain `n` tuples, each representing a line from the input. The `name` variable will hold the last string read from the input, and `type_` will hold the last integer read from the input.

If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the `files` list will remain empty.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains a string and an integer, the string consists of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters, and all strings are distinct.**
