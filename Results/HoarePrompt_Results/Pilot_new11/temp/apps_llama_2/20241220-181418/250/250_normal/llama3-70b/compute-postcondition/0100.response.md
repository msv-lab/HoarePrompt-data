According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, and `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element after the current `j`. This means that `additional_marks` should still contain all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, including the new sum `i + j` if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `additional_marks` must have at least one more element and `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that must have at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks` after the current one, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, and has at least one more element, and `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`**
