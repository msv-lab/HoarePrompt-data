To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The loop iterates over `additional_marks`.
2. The state of `additional_marks` depends on the values of `need_x` and `need_y`.
3. If `need_y` is False, then `additional_marks` contains the values of `x` and `y`.
4. If `need_y` is True, then the state of `additional_marks` depends on `need_x`. If `need_x` is False, `additional_marks` contains the value of `x`; otherwise, it remains an empty list.

Given these conditions, for the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must not be empty. This means that either `need_y` must be False (in which case `additional_marks` will contain `x` and `y`), or `need_y` must be True and `need_x` must be False (in which case `additional_marks` will contain `x`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `additional_marks` must be non-empty.
- If `need_y` is False, then `additional_marks` contains `x` and `y`.
- If `need_y` is True, then `need_x` must be False for `additional_marks` to contain `x`.
- `j` is an element in `additional_marks`, which could be either `x` or both `x` and `y` depending on the state of `need_y` and `need_x`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that must be non-empty, `i` is an element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either False or True but if True then `need_x` must be False for the loop to execute, `additional_marks` is a list that must be non-empty, `j` is an element in `additional_marks`**
