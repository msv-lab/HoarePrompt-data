According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `marks`. If `marks` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `marks` is not empty and `i` is an element in `marks`. Since `i` is initially set to `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, it may or may not be an element in `marks`. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to be an element in `marks`. The state of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `need_x`, and `need_y` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they are still part of the state. The state of `additional_marks` depends on `need_x` and `need_y`, but it does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that must be non-empty, `i` is an element in `marks`, `need_x` is False, if `need_y` is False, then `additional_marks` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y`, if `need_y` is True, then `additional_marks` contains the value of `x` if `need_x` is False, otherwise `additional_marks` remains an empty list**
