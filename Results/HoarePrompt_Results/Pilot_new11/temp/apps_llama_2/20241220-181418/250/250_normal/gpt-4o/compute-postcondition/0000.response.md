The given code snippet reads input from the user and assigns it to the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`. These variables are assigned integer values based on the input provided.

`n` is assigned an integer value from the input, `l` is assigned an integer value from the input, `x` is assigned an integer value from the input, and `y` is assigned an integer value from the input.

The value of `n` will be an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the value of `l` will be an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), the value of `x` will be an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), and the value of `y` will be an input integer (x < y ≤ l).

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), and there is a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 <... < a_{n} = l) representing the ruler.**
