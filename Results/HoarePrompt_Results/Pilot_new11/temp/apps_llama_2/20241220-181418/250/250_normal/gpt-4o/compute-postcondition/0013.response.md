The `break` statement breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change. 

The initial state remains the same: `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. The current values of `x_found` and `y_found` are both `True`, meaning that for at least one `mark` in `marks`, `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, and `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is `True`, `y_found` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
