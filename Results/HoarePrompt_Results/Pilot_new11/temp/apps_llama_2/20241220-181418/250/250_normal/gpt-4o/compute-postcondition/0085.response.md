The code `result.append(y)` adds the value of `y` to the end of the `result` list. 

The value of `n` remains an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). 
The value of `l` remains an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9). 
The value of `x` remains an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l). 
The value of `y` remains an input integer (x < y ≤ l). 
The value of `marks` remains a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l). 
The value of `marks_set` remains a set of unique integers from `marks`. 
The value of `new_marks` remains an empty set. 
The value of `x_found` remains False. 
The value of `result` is now a list containing the values of `x` and `y` ([x, y]). 
The value of `y_found` remains False.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `x_found` is False, `result` is a list containing the values of `x` and `y` ([x, y]), and `y_found` is False**
