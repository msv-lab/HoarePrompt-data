You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to handle all possible cases as described in the problem description. It first checks if the distances x and y can be measured using the existing marks on the ruler. If both x and y can be measured, it outputs 0 and does not add any new marks. If either x or y cannot be measured, it attempts to find a new mark that can be added to measure both x and y. If such a mark is found, it outputs 1 and the new mark. If no such mark is found, it outputs 2 and the distances x and y as the new marks.

The program handles all edge cases, including when the input distances x and y are already measurable using the existing marks, and when the input distances x and y are not measurable using the existing marks but can be made measurable by adding one or two new marks.

After careful review, no potential case was found where the program does not follow the problem description. The examples provided in the problem statement also work as expected with the given program.

However, one should note that the code could be optimized and improved for better readability and performance. But in terms of correctness, it appears to handle all cases as specified. 

To further prove the correctness of this code, more test cases could be run on it. Also, a formal proof of correctness could be provided, which would involve showing that the code works as expected for all possible inputs. But based on the provided code and problem description, the code appears to be correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

If `new_marks` is empty, then the value 2 has been printed, a string containing the values of `x` and `y` has been printed, and the function returns a list containing the values of `x` and `y` ([x, y]).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints a value or a list of values based on the input of a ruler's markings and dimensions, specifically integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is the number of markings on the ruler, `l` is the length of the ruler, and `x` and `y` are two distinct markings. The function first checks if there are any markings that are `x` or `y` units away from each other. If such markings exist for both `x` and `y`, it prints `0`. If not, it then calculates and prints either a single marking that is `x` or `y` units away from an existing marking, or a list of `x` and `y` if no such markings can be added. The function does not handle any exceptions that may occur due to invalid input and does not modify the input values.
