Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are True, then 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if `new_marks` is not empty, the function returns an element that was in `new_marks` before the pop operation. If `new_marks` is empty, then the value 2 has been printed, a string containing the values of `x` and `y` has been printed, and the function returns a list containing the values of `x` and `y` ([x, y]).**
