The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `j`. Assuming `j` is some integer, the impact of the code on the program is that `additional_marks` now has at least one more element, which is the sum of `i` and `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` may have been updated with new elements, `i` may refer to a different element in the updated `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either False or True but if True then `need_x` must be False, `additional_marks` has at least one more element which is `i + j`**
