Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately solves the problem described. It correctly checks if the existing markings on the ruler can measure the distances of x and y centimeters. If both x and y can be measured, it prints 0. If not, it tries to find a single additional marking that can be used to measure either x or y, taking into account the possibility of combining x and y to achieve the missing measurement. If no such single marking can be found, it correctly identifies that both x and y need to be added as new markings.

The code handles all potential cases described in the problem, including the examples provided. It does not attempt to handle invalid inputs as that is not part of the problem description, and it is assumed that the input will always be valid.

The logic of adding markings is sound, checking for the possibility of measuring x or y directly and then considering combinations that involve both x and y to cover all potential scenarios for adding the least number of new markings necessary.

Overall, the code is a correct implementation of the problem's requirements, handling the need to add markings to a ruler to measure specific distances with the minimum number of additions.
