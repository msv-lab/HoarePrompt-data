Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers. The current value of `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, then both `need_x` and `need_y` are False. Otherwise, `need_x` is False. The current value of `need_y` is False, meaning there does not exist a pair of elements in `marks` with a difference of `y`. `additional_marks` is a list, and since `need_x` is False, `additional_marks` contains the value of `x`.**
