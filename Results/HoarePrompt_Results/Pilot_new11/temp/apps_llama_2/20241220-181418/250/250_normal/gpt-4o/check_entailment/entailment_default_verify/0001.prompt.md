You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    marks_set = set(marks)
    x_found = False
    y_found = False
    for mark in marks:
        if mark + x in marks_set or mark - x in marks_set:
            x_found = True
        if mark + y in marks_set or mark - y in marks_set:
            y_found = True
        if x_found and y_found:
            break
    if x_found and y_found:
        print(0)
    else:
        new_marks = set()
        for mark in marks:
            if not x_found:
                if mark + x + y in marks_set or mark + x - y in marks_set or mark - x + y in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark + x)
                elif mark - x + y in marks_set or mark - x - y in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark - x)
            if not y_found:
                if mark + y + x in marks_set or mark + y - x in marks_set or mark - y + x in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark + y)
                elif mark - y + x in marks_set or mark - y - x in marks_set:
                    new_marks.add(mark - y)
        if new_marks:
            print(1)
            print(new_marks.pop())
        else:
            result = []
            if not x_found:
                result.append(x)
            if not y_found:
                result.append(y)
            print(len(result))
            print(' '.join(map(str, result)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to be correct according to the problem description. It checks if the given ruler can already measure the distances x and y by iterating through each mark and checking if adding or subtracting x or y results in another mark. If both x and y can be measured, it outputs 0. 

If either x or y cannot be measured, it attempts to find a new mark that would allow both x and y to be measured. If such a mark is found, it outputs 1 along with the new mark. 

If no such mark is found, it outputs 2 along with the values of x and y, which can be used as new marks to measure both distances.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly handles all possible scenarios, including when both x and y can be measured, when only one of them can be measured, and when neither can be measured. 

It also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the given marks are the minimum required (i.e., the start and end of the ruler), and when the marks are already sufficient to measure both x and y. 

Therefore, I believe the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and prints a value or a list of values based on the input of a ruler's markings and dimensions, specifically integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is the number of markings on the ruler, `l` is the length of the ruler, and `x` and `y` are two distinct markings. The function first checks if there are any markings that are `x` or `y` units away from each other. If such markings exist for both `x` and `y`, it prints `0`. If not, it then calculates and prints either a single marking that is `x` or `y` units away from an existing marking, or a list of `x` and `y` if no such markings can be added. The function does not handle any exceptions that may occur due to invalid input and does not modify the input values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
