The code adds `mark - y` to the set `new_marks`. 

The value of `mark` is `marks[1]`, which is the second mark in `marks`. The value of `y` is an input integer (`x < y ≤ l`). 

The other variables are not affected by this code. 

The sets `marks_set` and the list `marks` still contain the unique integers and sequence on the ruler, respectively. 

The Output State is: 
`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), 
`l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), 
`x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), 
`y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), 
`marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), 
`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, 
`mark` is the second mark in `marks`, 
`new_marks` contains at least `mark - y` which equals `marks[1] - y`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in `marks`, `new_marks` contains at least `marks[1] - y`**
