Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` may have been updated with new elements, `i` may refer to a different element in the updated `marks`, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either False or True but if True then `need_x` must be False. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` has at least two more elements and its last element is `i + j`.***
