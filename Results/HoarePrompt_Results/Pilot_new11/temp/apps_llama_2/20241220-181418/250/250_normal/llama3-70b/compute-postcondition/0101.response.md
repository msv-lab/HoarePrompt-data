The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to `additional_marks`. The value of `i` is the next element in `marks` after the current one, and the value of `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`. 

The states of the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, and `need_y` are not affected. 

`additional_marks` now contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, plus the sum of `i` and `j`. 

The value of `j` is updated to the next element in the updated `additional_marks`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers that must have at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `marks` after the current one, `need_x` is False, `need_y` is either True or False, `additional_marks` contains all possible sums of elements from the original `marks` and the initial `additional_marks` that do not exceed `l` and are not in `marks`, plus `i + j`, and has at least one more element, and `j` is the next element in the updated `additional_marks`**
