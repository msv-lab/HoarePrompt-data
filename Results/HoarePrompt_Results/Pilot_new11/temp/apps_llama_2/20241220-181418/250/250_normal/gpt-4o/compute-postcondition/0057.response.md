Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in `marks`. If `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then a new set `new_marks` contains `marks[1] + x`. If none of these values are in `marks_set`, then if `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` contains at least `marks[1] - x`.**
