Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `y_found` is False, `x_found` is unchanged. If for any mark in `marks`, `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set`, `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + y` for at least one mark in `marks`. Otherwise, if for any mark in `marks`, `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then a new set `new_marks` is created containing the results of `mark - y` for each mark in `marks`. In all cases, `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, and `marks_set` retain their initial properties, and none of the conditions `mark + y + x` is in `marks_set`, `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set`, `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set` are met for the else part.**
