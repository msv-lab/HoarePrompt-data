The code sets `need_y` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `need_y` is True. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `need_y` is True, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True.**
