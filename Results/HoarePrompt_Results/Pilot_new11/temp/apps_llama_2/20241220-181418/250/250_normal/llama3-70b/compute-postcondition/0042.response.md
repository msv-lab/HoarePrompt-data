To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we'll examine the given for loop statement and the provided program state before the loop starts.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer greater than 2,
- `l` is an input integer,
- `x` is an input integer,
- `y` is an input integer,
- `marks` is a set of input integers,
- `i` is 2,
- `need_x` is True if there exists a `j` in `marks` where `marks[j] - marks[1] == x`,
- `need_y` is True if there exists a `j` in `marks` where `marks[j] - marks[1] == y`.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `i` must be less than `n` because the loop iterates over `range(i, n)`. Since `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2, this condition is satisfied.
2. `j` will take on the value of `i` (which is 2) in the first iteration and will increment by 1 in each subsequent iteration until it reaches `n`.
3. The variables `l`, `x`, `y`, `marks`, `need_x`, and `need_y` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, as the loop's execution depends solely on the range defined by `i` and `n`.

However, to provide a comprehensive view of the state at the start of the loop, considering that `j` is about to be initialized and will take the value of `i` (which is 2) in the first iteration, we should note that `j` is now 2, equivalent to the value of `i`.

Thus, considering all the variables and conditions provided:
- `n` remains an integer greater than 2,
- `l` remains an input integer,
- `x` remains an input integer,
- `y` remains an input integer,
- `marks` remains a set of input integers,
- `i` is 2,
- `j` is now 2 (as it takes the value of `i` at the start of the loop),
- `need_x` and `need_y` retain their boolean values based on the conditions related to `marks`, `x`, and `y`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `need_x` is True if there exists a `j` in `marks` where `marks[j] - marks[1] == x`, `need_y` is True if there exists a `j` in `marks` where `marks[j] - marks[1] == y**
