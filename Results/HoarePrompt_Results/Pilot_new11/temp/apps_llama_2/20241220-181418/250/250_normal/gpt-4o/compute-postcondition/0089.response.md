Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`. If `new_marks` is not empty, then `new_marks` is a non-empty set containing values that are either `mark + x`, `mark - x`, `mark + y`, or `mark - y` for some `mark` in `marks`, and the function returns an element that was in `new_marks` before the pop operation. If `new_marks` is empty, then `new_marks` is an empty set, `y_found` is False, `x_found` is False, the value 2 has been printed, a string containing the values of `x` and `y` has been printed, and the function returns a list containing the values of `x` and `y` ([x, y]).**
