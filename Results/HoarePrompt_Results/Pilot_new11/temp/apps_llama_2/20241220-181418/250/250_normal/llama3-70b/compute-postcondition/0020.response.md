Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_x` is True if `marks[j] - marks[i]` also equals `x`, and `need_y` is True. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` does not equal `y`, then there is no change in the state of the variables.***
