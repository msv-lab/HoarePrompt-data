The code creates a new set called `marks` and assigns it the value of a set of integers obtained from the input. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each string in the input split by spaces, effectively converting each string to an integer. The `set` function then removes any duplicate integers.

The initial state variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `marks` is a set of input integers**
