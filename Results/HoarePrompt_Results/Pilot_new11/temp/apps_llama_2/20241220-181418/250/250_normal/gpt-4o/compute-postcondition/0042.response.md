Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l` is an input integer (2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9), `x` is an input integer (1 ≤ x < y ≤ l), `y` is an input integer (x < y ≤ l), `marks` is a list of n input integers representing the sequence on the ruler (0 = marks[0] < marks[1] <... < marks[n-1] = l) that must have at least 1 mark, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from `marks`, `x_found` is False, `y_found` indicates whether a mark plus or minus `y` exists in `marks_set`. If `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, or `mark - x + y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing `marks[0] + x`. If neither of these conditions is met, but `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` exists in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x`. Otherwise, `new_marks` remains an empty set.***
