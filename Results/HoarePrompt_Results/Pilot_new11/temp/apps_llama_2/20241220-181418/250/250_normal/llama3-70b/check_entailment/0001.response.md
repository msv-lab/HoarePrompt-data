Correctness: **False**

The program is not entirely correct. It does not handle the case when adding a mark for `x` or `y` would make it possible to measure both `x` and `y`. In such cases, the program should only add one mark.

Here is a potential counterexample:

Input:
```
2 300 100 200
0 300
```

In this case, adding a mark for 100 would make it possible to measure both 100 and 200 (by measuring from the 100 mark to the 300 mark, and then from the 0 mark to the 100 mark, and from the 100 mark to the 300 mark, 200 is 100 + 100). However, the program would add two marks: one for 100 and one for 200.

This can be solved by checking if adding a mark would make it possible to measure both `x` and `y`, and if so, only adding that mark. 

The correct solution would require checking all possible additional marks before adding any, and only adding the minimum number of marks necessary to measure both `x` and `y`.
