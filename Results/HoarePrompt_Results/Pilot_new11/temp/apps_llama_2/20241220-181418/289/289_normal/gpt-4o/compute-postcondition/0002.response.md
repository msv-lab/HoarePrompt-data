The `print` function does not change the values of the variables. It only outputs the value of `max_games` to the console. The value of `max_games` is still equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`. The state of the variable `n` is not affected by the `print` function. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, `max_games` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1` and `max_games` has been printed.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, `max_games` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1` and `max_games` has been printed.**
