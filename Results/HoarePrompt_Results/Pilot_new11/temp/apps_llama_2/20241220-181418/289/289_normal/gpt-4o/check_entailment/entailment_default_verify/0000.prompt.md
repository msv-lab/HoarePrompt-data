You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Famous Brazil city Rio de Janeiro holds a tennis tournament and Ostap Bender doesn't want to miss this event. There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.

Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.

Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
1

Input
3

Output
2

Input
4

Output
2

Input
10

Output
4



-----Note-----

In all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.

In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.

In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. 

In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_games = n.bit_length() - 1
    print(max_games)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program calculates the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in, assuming the rule that two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played.

The program uses the property of binary trees, where each game is a node, and the winner of a game becomes a node in the next level. Since each game has two players, this can be visualized as a binary tree where each internal node has two children.

The maximum number of games the winner can play is equal to the height of the binary tree with `n` leaves (players). This height is equal to the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary, minus 1 (since the height of a tree with a single node is 0).

The program uses the `bit_length()` function in Python, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent a number in binary. This function is used to calculate the height of the binary tree, which is then printed as the result.

The provided examples show that this program works correctly for different values of `n`, and it can be proven that it will work for any `n` by the properties of binary trees. 

For instance, when `n` is 2, there is only one game, and the winner can only play in this one game, so the result is 1. 

When `n` is 3 or 4, the maximum number of games the winner can play is 2, because the winner needs to play against another player who has played one game (the loser of the first game), and then play against the winner of the game between the two players who have not played yet.

The provided program correctly handles all these cases and will work for any `n`, so it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer input from the user, representing the number of players in a tournament, and returns the maximum number of games required to determine the winner, which is calculated as the bit length of the input number minus 1. The function assumes the input is a single integer n, such that n is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18. After execution, the program prints the calculated maximum number of games to the console, effectively providing the minimum number of rounds needed to complete the tournament, given the number of participants. The function does not handle cases where the input is not an integer or is outside the specified range, which could lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
