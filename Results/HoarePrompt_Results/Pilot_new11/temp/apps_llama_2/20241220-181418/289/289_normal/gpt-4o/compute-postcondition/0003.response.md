The function `func` does not seem to accept any parameters as per the given definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it should accept an integer `n`. 

Given the parameter constraints: 
The input is a single integer `n`, such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, representing the number of players to participate in the tournament.

Since the output is not specified, we can't provide a specific return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` representing the number of players, where `n` is between 2 and 10^18 (inclusive).


Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n, where n is between 2 and 10^18 (inclusive), representing the number of players.**
