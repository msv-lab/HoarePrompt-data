#State of the program right berfore the function call: no input variables are explicitly defined in the function, however, based on the problem description, we can infer that n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user, representing the number of players in a tournament, where `n` is expected to be between 2 and 10^18 (inclusive), calculates the number of bits necessary to represent this number in binary (minus one), and prints this value. The function does not explicitly return a value, implying its purpose is to perform this calculation and output the result. The final state of the program after execution includes the user's input being processed and the calculated result being printed to the console, with no explicit return value provided by the function. Note that the function does not validate if the input `n` is within the specified range, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if `n` is outside this range or not an integer. The function's behavior for edge cases, such as inputs of 1, 0, negative numbers, or non-integer values, is not explicitly defined by the annotations but is determined by how the `int(input())` and `bit_length()` functions handle these inputs.
