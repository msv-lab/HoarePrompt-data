The code `bits.append(smallest - 1)` appends the value `smallest - 1` to the list `bits`. The value of `smallest` is the last index of a bit set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` which was the last element in `bits` before it was removed. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is -1, `bits` is a list of indices representing the positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the added element `smallest - 1`, and the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus one is less than `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is -1, `bits` is a list of indices representing the positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with elements including `smallest - 1`, and the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus one is less than `k`.**
