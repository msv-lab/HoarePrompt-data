Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 58. If the 58th bit of `n` is 1, then `bits` is a list that contains 58 and may contain 59 (if the 59th bit of `n` is 1) and may or may not contain 60. If the 58th bit of `n` is 0, then `bits` is a list that may or may not contain 60 and must contain 59 (if the 59th bit of `n` is 1).**
