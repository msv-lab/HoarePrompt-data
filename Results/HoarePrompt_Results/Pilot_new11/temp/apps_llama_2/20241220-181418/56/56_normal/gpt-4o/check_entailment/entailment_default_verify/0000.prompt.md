You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python code is a solution to the problem described. It works by representing the input number `n` in binary form and then iteratively splitting the smallest bits to form a sequence of `k` integers with the sum of two to the power of each integer equaling `n`. The code maintains the lexicographically largest sequence by sorting the bits in descending order after the splitting process.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's logic:

1. It checks if `k` is greater than `n` and returns "No" in that case, as it's impossible to form a sequence of `k` integers with the sum of two to the power of each integer equaling `n` when `k` is greater than `n`.

2. It represents `n` in binary form and stores the positions of the bits set to 1 in the `bits` list.

3. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, it returns "No", as it's impossible to form a sequence of `k` integers with the sum of two to the power of each integer equaling `n` in this case.

4. If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, it iteratively splits the smallest bits by subtracting 1 from the smallest bit and adding two new bits with the new value to the `bits` list, effectively splitting the bit into two smaller bits.

5. After the splitting process, it sorts the `bits` list in descending order to maintain the lexicographically largest sequence.

6. Finally, it returns "Yes" followed by the sequence of integers as a string, with each integer separated by a space.

The code handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description and works correctly for the provided examples. It's also efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only requires a single pass over the binary representation of `n`.

In conclusion, the given Python code is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It handles all the edge cases and provides the lexicographically largest sequence of integers with the sum of two to the power of each integer equaling `n`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function checks whether it's possible to set exactly `k` bits to 1 in the binary representation of a non-negative integer `n` by potentially shifting bits to the right. It accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits and `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits. The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of bits set to 1 in `n` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, it tries to meet the requirement of having exactly `k` bits set to 1 by shifting the rightmost set bit to the right and duplicating it until `k` bits are set. If this process is successful, the function returns 'Yes' followed by a list of `k` numbers representing the bit positions in descending order. Note that the bit positions in the returned list may not reflect the actual bit positions in the original number `n` due to the manipulation performed by the function. The function handles potential edge cases, including when `n` is 0, when `k` is 1, and when `n` has fewer than `k` bits set to 1. However, it does not handle cases where the input values exceed the specified digit limits or where the inputs are not integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
