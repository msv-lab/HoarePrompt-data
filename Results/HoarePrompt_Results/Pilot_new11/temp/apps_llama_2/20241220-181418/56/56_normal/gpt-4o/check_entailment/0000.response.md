Correctness: **True**.

The given Python code is a solution to the problem described. It works by representing the input number `n` in binary form and then iteratively splitting the smallest bits to form a sequence of `k` integers with the sum of two to the power of each integer equaling `n`. The code maintains the lexicographically largest sequence by sorting the bits in descending order after the splitting process.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's logic:

1. It checks if `k` is greater than `n` and returns "No" in that case, as it's impossible to form a sequence of `k` integers with the sum of two to the power of each integer equaling `n` when `k` is greater than `n`.

2. It represents `n` in binary form and stores the positions of the bits set to 1 in the `bits` list.

3. If the length of `bits` is greater than `k`, it returns "No", as it's impossible to form a sequence of `k` integers with the sum of two to the power of each integer equaling `n` in this case.

4. If the length of `bits` is less than `k`, it iteratively splits the smallest bits by subtracting 1 from the smallest bit and adding two new bits with the new value to the `bits` list, effectively splitting the bit into two smaller bits.

5. After the splitting process, it sorts the `bits` list in descending order to maintain the lexicographically largest sequence.

6. Finally, it returns "Yes" followed by the sequence of integers as a string, with each integer separated by a space.

The code handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description and works correctly for the provided examples. It's also efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only requires a single pass over the binary representation of `n`.

In conclusion, the given Python code is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. It handles all the edge cases and provides the lexicographically largest sequence of integers with the sum of two to the power of each integer equaling `n`.
