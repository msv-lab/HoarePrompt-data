The code `bits.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the elements of the `bits` list in descending order. The initial state of `bits` is a list with a length of `k`, where `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits, `i` is -1, and `bits` is a list of length `k` with its elements sorted in descending order**.
