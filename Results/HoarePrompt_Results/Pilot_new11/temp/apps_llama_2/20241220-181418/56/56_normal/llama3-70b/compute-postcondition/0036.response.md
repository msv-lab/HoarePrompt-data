Postcondition: **`n` is the remaining value after subtracting the largest powers of 2 that can be represented by the bits in the original value of `n`, `i` is the number of times the most significant bit in `n` can be removed until `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `a` contains the positions of the most significant bits in `n` at each iteration, if the length of `a` is less than `k`, the string 'No' has been printed, otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed along with the content of `a` which contains the first `k` positions of the most significant bits in `n` in descending order.**
