The code appends `smallest - 1` to the `bits` list. The value of `smallest` is the last index of a bit set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` which was the last element in `bits` before it was removed. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, 
`k` is still a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`, 
`i` is still -1, 
the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus one is still less than `k`, 
and `smallest` is still the last index of a bit set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` which was the last element in `bits` before it was removed.

`bits` is now a list of indices representing the positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus the index `smallest - 1` with the last element removed and then `smallest - 1` appended.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits, `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits and is less than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is -1, `bits` is a list of indices representing the positions of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus the index `smallest - 1`, `smallest` is the last index of a bit set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` which was the last element in `bits` before it was removed, and the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` plus one is less than `k`**
