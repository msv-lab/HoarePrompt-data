To calculate the output state, let's break down the information given and the return statement.

- `n` is a non-negative integer of up to 18 digits. This information isn't directly used in the return statement.
- `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits. This information is relevant because `bits` is a list of length `k`.
- `i` is -1. This information isn't directly used in the return statement.
- `bits` is a list of length `k` with its elements sorted in descending order. This is crucial for the return statement as it directly uses `bits`.

The return statement is `'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))`. This means the program returns a string that starts with `'Yes\n'` followed by the elements of `bits` converted to strings and joined by spaces.

Given that `bits` is a list of length `k` (where `k` is a positive integer of up to 5 digits) and its elements are sorted in descending order, the output will be a string that includes `'Yes\n'` followed by the string representations of the elements in `bits`, separated by spaces.

Output State: **The program returns a string starting with 'Yes\n' followed by the string representations of the elements in `bits`, a list of length `k` (up to 5 digits) with elements in descending order, separated by spaces.**
