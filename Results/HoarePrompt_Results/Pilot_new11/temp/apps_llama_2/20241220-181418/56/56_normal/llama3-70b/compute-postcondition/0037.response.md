Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are input integers. If `n` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, `n` is the remaining value after subtracting the largest powers of 2 that can be represented by the bits in the original value of `n`, and `i` is the number of times the most significant bit in `n` can be removed until `n` is less than or equal to `i`. Additionally, `a` contains the positions of the most significant bits in `n` at each iteration. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed along with the content of `a`, which contains the first `k` positions of the most significant bits in `n` in descending order.**
