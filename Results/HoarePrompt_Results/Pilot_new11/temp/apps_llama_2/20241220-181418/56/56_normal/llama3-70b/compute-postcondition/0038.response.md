It seems there is missing information in the provided task, as the function definition is empty and does not specify any parameters, and there is no description of the output. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, I will attempt to describe the functionality in a general sense.


The function `func` seems to be intended to accept parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^18, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^5. Without information on the output or the specific relationship between `n` and `k` and the return value, the description of the functionality will be limited.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, where n and k are non-negative integers with n less than or equal to 10^18 and k less than or equal to 10^5, but the return value is unspecified.**
