Correctness: **False**.

The issue with this program is that it doesn't handle the case when `a` or `b` equals `s`. The range function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value, so the loop `for a in range(1, s)` will stop at `s-1`. However, for the problem description, it is possible that `a` or `b` equals `s` (for example, when `s` equals `x`).

For example, when the input is `10 10`, the program will output `0` because it doesn't check the case when `a` equals `10` and `b` equals `0`, or vice versa. However, this is not a correct solution for the problem, because the problem statement allows for `a` and `b` to be any positive integers that satisfy the given conditions, including the case when one of them is equal to `s`.

To fix this issue, the loop should be changed to `for a in range(1, s+1)` to include the case when `a` equals `s`. However, we also need to add a check to ensure that `b` is greater than `0` to satisfy the condition that `a` and `b` are both positive integers.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if b > 0 and a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    print(count)
```
This code will correctly count the number of possible ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
