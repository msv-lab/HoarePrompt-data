Postcondition: **`s` is an input integer greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, initially `count` is 0, `a` is 1, and `b` is `s - 1`. The current value of `a` is 1 and the current value of `b` is `s - 1`. `a` and `b` have a bitwise XOR equal to `x`, meaning `a ^ b == x` is true, and all other initial conditions of `s`, `x`, `count`, `a`, and `b` hold as given**
