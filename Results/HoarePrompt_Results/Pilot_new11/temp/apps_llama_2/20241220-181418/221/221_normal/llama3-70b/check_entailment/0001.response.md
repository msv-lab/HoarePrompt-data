Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when `a` or `b` can be equal to `s - 1` and still satisfy the conditions `1 ≤ a, b ≤ s - 1`. 

This issue arises in the line `for a in range(1, s):`, which should be `for a in range(1, s + 1):` to include the possibility of `a` or `b` equaling `s - 1` (since `a` and `b` can be `1` and `s - 1` to satisfy `1 ≤ a, b ≤ s - 1`).

However, another condition `b > 0` should also be considered, since the problem statement specifies `a` and `b` as positive integers. 

Here's the corrected code for better understanding:
```python
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if b > 0 and a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    print(count)
```
In this corrected code, the condition `if b > 0 and a ^ b == x:` ensures that both `a` and `b` are positive integers and that their XOR equals `x`.
