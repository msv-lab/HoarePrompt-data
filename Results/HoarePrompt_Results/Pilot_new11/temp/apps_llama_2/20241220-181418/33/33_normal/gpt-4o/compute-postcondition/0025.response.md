Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer equivalent of the first part of the input string. If `dir` is 'North', then the current value of `position` is `position - t`, and the current value of `valid` is False if the initial `position` is less than `t`, otherwise the current value of `valid` remains unchanged. If `dir` is 'South', then the current value of `position` is `t` and the current value of `valid` is False if `2t` is greater than 20000, otherwise the current value of `valid` is True. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', then the current value of `valid` is False if `position` is 0 or 20000, otherwise the current value of `valid` remains True and the values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `position` are unchanged. If `dir` is neither 'North', 'South', 'West', nor 'East', then the state of the program remains unchanged. The current value of `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000.**
