The value of `curr_lat` is incremented by `t / 111.195`. The previous value of `curr_lat` is unknown, but the values of `n`, `t_{i}`, `dir_{i}`, `t`, and `dir` are not affected by this operation. 
The new value of `curr_lat` can be expressed as `curr_lat + t / 111.195`.
The values of `n`, `t_{i}`, `dir_{i}`, `t`, and `dir` remain the same, with `n` being a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` being a positive integer, `dir_{i}` being one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` being an integer, and `dir` being a string representing a direction.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `curr_lat` is `curr_lat + t / 111.195`**
