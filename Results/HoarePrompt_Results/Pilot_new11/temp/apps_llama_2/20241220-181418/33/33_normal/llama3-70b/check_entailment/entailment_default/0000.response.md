Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately simulates Limak's journey and checks if the conditions specified in the problem description are met. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. It correctly calculates the final latitude after all parts of the journey. It uses an approximation of 111.195 kilometers per degree of latitude to update the current latitude based on the direction and time of each part of the journey.

2. It correctly handles invalid movements. If Limak is at the North Pole (latitude 90 degrees), it checks if the direction is 'South'. If not, it prints 'NO' and exits. If Limak is at the South Pole (latitude -90 degrees), it checks if the direction is 'North'. If not, it prints 'NO' and exits.

3. It correctly handles movements that would result in a latitude outside the range of -90 to 90 degrees. If the updated latitude is less than -90 or greater than 90, it prints 'NO' and exits.

4. It correctly checks if the journey ends back at the starting point (North Pole). If the final latitude is 90 degrees, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. The code ignores east or west movements, which is correct according to the problem description. The problem description only mentions movements in the north or south direction and their effects on the latitude.

6. The code handles all the provided examples correctly. For example, the first example has a journey with 5 parts, and the code correctly calculates the final latitude and prints 'YES' because the journey ends back at the starting point. The second example has a journey with 2 parts, and the code correctly prints 'NO' because the journey does not end back at the starting point.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
