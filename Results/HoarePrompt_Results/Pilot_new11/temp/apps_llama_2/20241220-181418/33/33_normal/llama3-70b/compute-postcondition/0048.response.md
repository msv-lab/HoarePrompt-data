The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. 

Given the initial state, we know that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction.

Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we move on to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
