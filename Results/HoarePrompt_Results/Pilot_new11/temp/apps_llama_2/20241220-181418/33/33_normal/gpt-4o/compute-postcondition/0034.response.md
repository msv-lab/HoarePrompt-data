The code sets the variable `valid` to `False`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n-1` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string, and `valid` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n-1` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string, and `valid` is `False`**
