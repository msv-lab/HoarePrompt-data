You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the conditions described in the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it seems to work as expected:

1. **Input and Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of instructions `n` and initializing `curr_lat` to 90, which represents the latitude of the North Pole.

2. **Iteration Over Instructions**: For each instruction, it reads the distance `t` and direction `dir`. It then adjusts `curr_lat` based on the direction, considering that moving north increases latitude and moving south decreases it. The adjustment is done using `t / 111.195`, which seems to be an approximation for converting kilometers to degrees latitude, given that 1 degree of latitude is approximately 111.195 kilometers at the Earth's surface.

3. **Boundary Checking**: After each movement, the program checks if `curr_lat` exceeds the valid range (-90 to 90 degrees). If it does, it immediately prints 'NO' because such a movement is invalid according to the problem description.

4. **Pole Movement Validation**: The program also checks if Limak is at the North Pole (latitude 90) and attempts to move in any direction other than south, or if he is at the South Pole (latitude -90) and attempts to move in any direction other than north. In either case, it prints 'NO' because these movements are disallowed.

5. **Final Position Check**: After all instructions have been executed, the program checks if Limak ends up back at the North Pole (latitude 90). If he does, it prints 'YES', indicating that the journey description satisfies the conditions. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program handles the conditions outlined in the problem description: it validates movements from the poles, ensures that the journey does not attempt to move beyond the poles, and checks that the journey ends at the North Pole. All the provided example inputs are correctly handled by the program, and no obvious cases can be thought of where it would fail to meet the problem's requirements.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the examples provided, the program seems to be correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each i-th part of the journey, t_{i} is a positive integer, 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, and dir_{i} is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer if `n` is positive, `dir` is a direction string if `n` is positive, `curr_lat` is either within the range [-90, 90] adjusted by the sum of all "North" and "South" movements divided by 111.195, or it is outside this range if the program terminated, indicating an invalid movement.
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function simulates a journey consisting of a series of parts with specified times and directions. It accepts input from the user, including the number of parts in the journey and the time and direction for each part. The function calculates the final latitude after all parts of the journey, assuming a starting latitude of 90 degrees North and using an approximation of 111.195 kilometers per degree of latitude. The function checks for and handles invalid movements, including those that would result in a latitude outside the range of -90 to 90 degrees or those that involve moving away from the pole when already at it. At the conclusion of the function, it prints 'YES' if the final latitude is 90 degrees North and 'NO' otherwise, effectively determining whether the journey ends back at the starting point. The function does not account for east or west movements in its calculations, effectively ignoring them. Potential edge cases include a journey with zero parts, journeys with times or directions that are not positive integers or one of the four cardinal directions, and journeys involving invalid movements that trigger the function to exit and print 'NO' before completing all parts.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
