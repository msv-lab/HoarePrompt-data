Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction. If `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90], then if `dir` is 'North' and `curr_lat` is not -90, `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South' and `curr_lat` is not -90, `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `curr_lat` remains unchanged. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the program has printed 'NO' to the console and terminated. If `curr_lat` is outside the range [-90, 90], the program has printed 'NO' to the console and terminated. In the case of termination, if `dir` was 'North' before termination, `curr_lat` was increased by `t / 111.195` before termination. If `dir` was 'South' before termination, `curr_lat` was decreased by `t / 111.195` before termination. If `dir` was neither 'North' nor 'South' before termination, `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
