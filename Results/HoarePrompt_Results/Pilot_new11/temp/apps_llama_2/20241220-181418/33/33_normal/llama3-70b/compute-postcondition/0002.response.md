According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", and `curr_lat` is 90. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `curr_lat` is 90**
