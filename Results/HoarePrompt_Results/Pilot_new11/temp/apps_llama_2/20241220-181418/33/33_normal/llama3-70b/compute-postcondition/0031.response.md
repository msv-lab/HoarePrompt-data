The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables. 

The values of the variables do not change but we skip to the next iteration of the loop we are directly inside. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
