The given code prints 'NO' to the console, but it does not change the values of any variables. The values of `n`, `t_{i}`, `dir_{i}`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain the same as in the initial state. Since `curr_lat` is initially -90 and `dir` is not 'North', the condition for `curr_lat` to be `90 + t / 111.195` is not met. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction string and `dir` is not 'North', `curr_lat` is -90**
