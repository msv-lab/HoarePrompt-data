The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement has no direct impact on the variables. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop we are directly inside, if any.


Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer, `dir` is an input direction string, the input direction `dir` is not 'North', and `dir` is not 'South', and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop we are directly inside.**
