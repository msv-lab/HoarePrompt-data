Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It checks the three conditions specified:

1. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.
2. If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.
3. The journey must end on the North Pole.

The program initializes a `position` variable to 0, representing the North Pole, and a `valid` variable to True. It then iterates over the input instructions, updating the `position` variable based on the direction and distance of each instruction. If the `position` variable goes outside the valid range of 0 to 20000, or if Limak tries to move in an invalid direction (e.g., moving south from the South Pole), the `valid` variable is set to False.

After processing all instructions, the program checks if the final `position` is 0, which represents the North Pole. If it is not, the `valid` variable is set to False. Finally, if `valid` is True, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the journey is valid, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Limak moving from the North Pole to the South Pole and back
* Limak trying to move in an invalid direction from the North or South Pole
* Limak's journey ending at the North Pole or at any other point

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
