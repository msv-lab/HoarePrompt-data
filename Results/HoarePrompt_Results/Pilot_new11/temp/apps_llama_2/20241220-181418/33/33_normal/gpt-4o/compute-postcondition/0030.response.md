The code converts the string `t` to an integer. The value of `n` and the existence of `n-1` pairs of values are not affected. The value of `dir` is also not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n-1` pairs of values exist, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string**
