According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `n` pairs of values (`t_i` and `dir_i`), `position` is 0, and `valid` is True. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` pairs of values (`t_i` and `dir_i`), `position` is 0, `valid` is True**
