The program has exited due to the `exit()` function call. The values of the variables do not change, but the program terminates immediately. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t_{i}` is a positive integer, `dir_{i}` is one of the strings: "North", "South", "West", "East", `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string representing a direction, the program has printed 'NO' to the console, if `dir` was 'North' before termination, `curr_lat` was increased by `t / 111.195` before termination, if `dir` was 'South' before termination, `curr_lat` was decreased by `t / 111.195` before termination, if `dir` was neither 'North' nor 'South' before termination, `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and the program has terminated.
