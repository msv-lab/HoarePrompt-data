Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `n` pairs of values must exist for the loop to execute one more time, `t` is the integer conversion of the first part of the input string, `dir` is the second part of the input string, if `position - t` is less than 0, then `valid` is `False`, otherwise the state of `position` and `valid` depend on the conditions related to `dir` and `t` as specified.**
