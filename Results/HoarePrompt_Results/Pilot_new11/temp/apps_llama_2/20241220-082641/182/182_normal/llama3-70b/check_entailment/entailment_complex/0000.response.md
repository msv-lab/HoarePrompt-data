Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

* The program takes an integer input `x` representing the camera angle in degrees, which can be positive (clockwise) or negative (counter-clockwise). This matches the problem description.
* The program normalizes the angle to a value between 0 and 359 by taking the modulus of the input with 360 using the expression `x = x % 360`. This is necessary because angles can be represented in multiple ways (e.g., 360 degrees is equivalent to 0 degrees).
* If the normalized angle is 0, the program prints 0, which means no rotation is needed.
* Otherwise, the program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical using the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This expression works as follows:
	+ `x + 90 - 1` shifts the angle to the range [-359, 359] and subtracts 1 to handle the case where `x` is a multiple of 90.
	+ `(x + 90 - 1) // 90` calculates the number of 90-degree turns required to rotate the image to the nearest multiple of 90 degrees.
	+ `% 4` ensures that the result is in the range [0, 3], which corresponds to the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required.
* The program prints the calculated value, which represents the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical.

The program handles all possible input values correctly, and the expression `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` always produces the correct result. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.
