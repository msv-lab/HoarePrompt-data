The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the input provided by the user. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each item in the input, effectively converting them to integers, and the `strip` and `split` functions are used to process the input string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace.

Given this, we can update the values of `n` and `m` to be the input integers.

Output State: **`d` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, there is a list of sofas, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers with 0 â‰¤ cntl, cntr, cntt, cntb â‰¤ d - 1**
