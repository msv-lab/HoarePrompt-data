The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since the initial state does not mention any loop, the `continue` statement will have no effect on the variables.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than `(j+1)+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j+1)th` tuple in `sofas`**
