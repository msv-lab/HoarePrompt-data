To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables in the initial state.


Given the initial state:
- `d` is a positive integer greater than `(j+1)+1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers
- `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j)th` tuple in `sofas`
- If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the value of `right_count` at index `i` has been incremented by 1

And the code snippet:
```python
left_count[i] += 1
```

The code increments the value of `left_count` at index `i` by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.


Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than `(j+1)+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j)th` tuple in `sofas`, `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the value of `right_count` at index `i` has been incremented by 1**
