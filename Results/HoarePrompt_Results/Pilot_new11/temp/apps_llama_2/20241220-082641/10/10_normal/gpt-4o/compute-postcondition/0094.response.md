The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, we assume it is part of a loop. The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables. 

The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `i`, and `j` remain the same. The loop will move on to the next iteration.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 2, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
