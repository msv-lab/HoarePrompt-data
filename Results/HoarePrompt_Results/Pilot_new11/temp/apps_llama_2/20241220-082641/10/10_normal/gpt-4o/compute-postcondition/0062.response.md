According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d` and the loop index `i`. If `i` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` must be one less than `d` since the loop has executed `d` times. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. 
State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `i` is `d`**
