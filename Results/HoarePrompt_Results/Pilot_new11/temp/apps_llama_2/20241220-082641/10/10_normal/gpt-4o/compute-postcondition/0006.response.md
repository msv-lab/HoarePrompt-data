According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If the loop has executed less than `d` times, it can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed one time. For the loop to execute again, the number of executions must be less than `d`, so we are now at the second execution.

State: **`d` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `[(x1, y1, x2, y2)]`, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers with 0 ≤ `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` ≤ `d` - 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers, and the loop has executed 1 time**
