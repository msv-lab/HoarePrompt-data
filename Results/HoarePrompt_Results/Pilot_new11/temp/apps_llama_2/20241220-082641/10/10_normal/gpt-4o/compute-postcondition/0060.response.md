Postcondition: ***`d` is a positive integer greater than `(j+1)+1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `j` is the initial value of `j` plus 2, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the four integers from the `(j)th` tuple in `sofas`. If `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. If `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then the value of `right_count` at index `i` has been incremented by 1. If the conditions `y1` > `y2_j` and `y2` > `y2_j` are not met, then the state of the variables remains unchanged with respect to `top_count[i]`.***
