The given Python code snippet is used to read four input integers and assign them to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` in the `sofas` list will be updated with these new input values.

Output State: **`d` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple `[(x1, y1, x2, y2)]` where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the new input integers, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers with 0 â‰¤ `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` â‰¤ `d` - 1, and the loop has executed 1 time**
