The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop specified in the given code snippet, we will assume that this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop structure, likely a `for` or `while` loop, that iterates over the `sofas` list or another condition related to the variables provided.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the values of the variables do not change because `continue` does not alter variable values; it merely controls the flow of the loop. Therefore, after executing the `continue` statement, all variables retain their current values, and the loop (if any) moves on to its next iteration.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the 1st tuple in `sofas`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa, `j` is 1, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
