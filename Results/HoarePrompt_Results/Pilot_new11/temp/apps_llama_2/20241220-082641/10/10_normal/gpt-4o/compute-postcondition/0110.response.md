The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since `i` is equal to `j`, which is 0, and `continue` is used, it means the current iteration of the loop (if there is one) will be skipped, and the loop will move on to the next iteration if there are more iterations to perform. 

However, because `i` equals `j` and both are 0, and given the absence of any loop structure in the provided snippet, the exact behavior (e.g., skipping to the next iteration) isn't directly observable from this snippet alone. But what is certain is that `continue` does not alter the values of variables directly; it only affects the flow of the program.

Given the initial state and the nature of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `right_count[d+1]`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged because `continue` itself does not modify variable values; it affects program flow.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the `i-th` tuple in `sofas`, `right_count[d+1]`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop if there are more iterations.**
