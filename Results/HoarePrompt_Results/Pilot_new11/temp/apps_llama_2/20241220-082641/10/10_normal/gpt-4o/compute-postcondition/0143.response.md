The value of `left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, and the conditions related to `x1`, `x2`, and `x1_j` are still valid and do not change. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`d` is at least 3, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j` = `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` = `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` = `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` = `sofas[j][3]`, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and if `i` equals `j`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the next statements, regardless of the condition `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`.**
