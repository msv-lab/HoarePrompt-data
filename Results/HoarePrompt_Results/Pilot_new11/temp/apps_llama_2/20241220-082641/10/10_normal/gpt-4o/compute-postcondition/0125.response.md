According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `d`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is at least 2, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. So, `j` becomes 1. Since `j` is now 1, the elements `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` should be the elements of the 1st tuple in `sofas`. 
State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of at least `d+1` tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the 1st tuple in `sofas`, `left_count[d+1]`, `bottom_count[d+1]`, `top_count[d+1]` contain the respective updated counts of sofas relative to the new last sofa, `j` is 1**
