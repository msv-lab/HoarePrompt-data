The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, but since `i` is `d`, this becomes `right_count[d] += 1`. The previous value of `right_count[d]` is unknown, so the output state is: `right_count[d]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 1, `right_count[d]` is increased by 1**
