The code assigns the values of four input integers to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `sofas` is an empty list, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are integers with 0 â‰¤ cntl, cntr, cntt, cntb â‰¤ d - 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers**
