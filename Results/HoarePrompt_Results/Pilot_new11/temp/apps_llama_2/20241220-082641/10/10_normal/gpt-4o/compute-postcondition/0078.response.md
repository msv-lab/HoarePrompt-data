Postcondition: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the first tuple in `sofas`, `i` is `d`, `j` is 0. The current values of `x1` and `x2` are such that if previously `x1` was greater than `x2_j` and `x2` was greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[d]` is `left_count[d] + 1`. The current values of `x1` and `x2` are such that if previously `x1` was less than `x1_j` and `x2` was less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[d]` is `right_count[d] + 1`. The current values of `y1` and `y2` are such that if previously `y1` was less than `y1_j` and `y2` was less than `y1_j`, then `bottom_count[d]` is incremented by 1. The current value of `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and the current value of `y2` is greater than `y2_j`.**
