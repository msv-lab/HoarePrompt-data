Postcondition: ***`d` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, each containing four integers, `cntl`, `cntr`, `cntt`, `cntb` are input integers, `right_count`, `left_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count` are lists of `d` integers. If `left_count[i]` equals `cntl`, `right_count[i]` equals `cntr`, `top_count[i]` equals `cntt`, and `bottom_count[i]` equals `cntb`, then `target_sofa` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If these conditions are not met, no changes are made.***
