The value of `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` equals `d`, `bottom_count[d]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `d` remains a positive integer, `n` and `m` remain input integers, `sofas` remains a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` remain the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` remain the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` remains equal to `d`, and `j` remains equal to 1. The conditions for `left_count[d]` and `right_count[d]` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are input integers, `sofas` is a list of `d` tuples, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the elements of the last tuple in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the elements of the second tuple in `sofas`, `i` equals `d`, `j` equals 1, `bottom_count[d]` is incremented by 1, if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, then `left_count[d]` is incremented by 1, if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count[d]` is incremented by 1, otherwise `right_count[d]` remains unchanged**
