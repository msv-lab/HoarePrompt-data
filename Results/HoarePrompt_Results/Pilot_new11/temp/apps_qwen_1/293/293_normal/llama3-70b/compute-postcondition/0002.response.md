Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\).
   - `ans` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `n > 1`.

3. **Objective:**
   - We need to determine what changes are required in the state such that the loop can execute at least once.

4. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `n > 1` must be true initially.
   - Given the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\), the smallest possible value for `n` is 1.
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjustment Needed:**
   - The only state that needs adjustment is `n` because it directly affects the loop condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2^`h`; `ans` is 0**
