The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans`. It does not change the value of any variable. The variables `h`, `n`, and `ans` retain their initial values from the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is 1, `ans` is the sum of the values added during each iteration based on the parity of `n`**
