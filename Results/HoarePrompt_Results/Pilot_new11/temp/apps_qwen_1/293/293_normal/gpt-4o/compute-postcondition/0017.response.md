The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node`. Initially, `current_node` is either 1 or 2 based on the first character of the original `path`. 

- If `current_node` is 1, then `2 * current_node + 2` becomes `2 * 1 + 2 = 4`.
- If `current_node` is 2, then `2 * current_node + 2` becomes `2 * 2 + 2 = 6`.

The values of the other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, and `current_level`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 2, `path` is the remaining part of the original path (one character shorter), `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is either 4 or 6 depending on the first character of the original `path`**
