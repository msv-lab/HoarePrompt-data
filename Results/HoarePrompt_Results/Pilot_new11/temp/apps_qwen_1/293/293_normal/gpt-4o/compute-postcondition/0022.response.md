The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node`. Given the initial conditions:

- `current_node` is either 3 or 4 depending on the value of `direction`.
- If `direction` is '0', `current_node` is either 3 or 5.
- Otherwise, `current_node` is either 4 or 6 depending on the first character of the original `path`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `current_node` is 3:
   - New value of `current_node`: \(2 \times 3 + 2 = 8\)

2. If `current_node` is 4:
   - New value of `current_node`: \(2 \times 4 + 2 = 10\)

3. If `direction` is '0' and `current_node` is 5:
   - New value of `current_node`: \(2 \times 5 + 2 = 12\)

4. If `direction` is '1' and `current_node` is 6:
   - New value of `current_node`: \(2 \times 6 + 2 = 14\)

Since the exact value of `current_node` depends on the value of `direction` and the first character of the original `path`, we can list all possible outcomes.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2; `visited_count` is 3; `path` is the remaining part of the original path (two characters shorter); `current_level` is 1; `current_node` is 8, 10, 12, or 14 depending on the value of `direction` and the first character of the original `path`.**
