`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The value of `visited_count` was 0 initially, so it becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`total_leaves`, `path`, `current_level`, and `current_node`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is the binary representation of `n - 1`, padded to length `h` with leading zeros, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 0**
