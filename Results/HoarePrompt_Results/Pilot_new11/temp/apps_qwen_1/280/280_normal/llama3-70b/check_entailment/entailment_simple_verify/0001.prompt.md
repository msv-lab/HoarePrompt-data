You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment. The issue lies in how the `max_speed` and `min_speed` are updated and added to `max_length` and `min_length`. The logic to update `max_speed` and `min_speed` assumes they will always converge towards the final speed `v2`, but this is not necessarily true. 

Consider the following input:
- Input: `1 2 3 1`
- Expected Output: The sequence of speeds could be `1, 2, 2`, leading to a total length of `1 + 2 + 2 = 5`.
- Program Output: The program calculates a much higher length because it incorrectly updates `max_speed` and `min_speed`.

The program should consider all possible sequences of speeds that meet the constraints and calculate the maximum possible length accordingly. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize the speed list with v1
    speeds = [v1]
    
    # Generate all possible speeds
    for _ in range(t - 2):
        next_speeds = []
        for speed in speeds:
            next_speeds.append(speed + d)
            next_speeds.append(speed)
            next_speeds.append(speed - d)
        speeds = next_speeds
    
    # Filter out invalid speeds
    valid_speeds = [speed for speed in speeds if abs(speed - v2) <= d and speed >= 0]
    
    # Calculate the maximum possible length
    max_length = 0
    for speed in valid_speeds:
        length = sum(speed for _ in range(t))
        max_length = max(max_length, length)
    
    print(max_length)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible sequences of speeds are considered and only valid sequences are used to calculate the maximum possible length.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        
        max_length += max_speed
        
        min_length += min_speed
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v1 \leq 100\); `v2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v2 \leq 100\); `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\); `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\); `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` reduced by \(d\) for each iteration until it equals `min_speed`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2` increased by `d` until it equals `max_speed`; `max_length` is the sum of all `max_speed` values from each iteration; `min_length` is the sum of all `min_speed` values from each iteration; `i` is 0.
    print(max_length)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
