The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables; it only causes the exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements, `mex` is either 1 or 2**
