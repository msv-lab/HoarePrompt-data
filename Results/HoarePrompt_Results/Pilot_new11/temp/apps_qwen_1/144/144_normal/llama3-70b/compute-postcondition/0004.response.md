Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer input from the first line of standard input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers from the second line of standard input.
   - `mex` is initially set to 1.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The for loop iterates over each element in `arr`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must be non-empty, as it needs to have at least one element to iterate over.
   - The value of `mex` does not directly affect the loop's execution since it is initialized and does not change within the loop based on the initial conditions given.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `arr` contains at least one element.
   - Since `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
   - The value of `mex` being 1 does not require adjustment as it is independent of the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- Ensure `n` is at least 1.
- Ensure `arr` is a non-empty list (i.e., it contains at least one element).

So, the final state should be:
**`n` must be at least 1, `arr` must contain at least one element, `mex` is 1**
