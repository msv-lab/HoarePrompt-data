The code `break` does not affect any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch-case statement. Since there is no loop or switch-case statement in the given code snippet, the variables `n`, `arr`, and `mex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, `mex` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `num` (next element in `arr`) equals `mex` or not. If `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` becomes 2; otherwise, `mex` remains 1.**
