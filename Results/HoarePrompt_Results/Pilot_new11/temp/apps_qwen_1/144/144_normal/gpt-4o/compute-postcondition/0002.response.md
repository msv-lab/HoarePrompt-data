The `sort()` method sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The initial state of `n` being an integer between 1 and 100,000, and `a` being a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and \(10^9\), is preserved. After sorting, the values in `a` will be in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)**
