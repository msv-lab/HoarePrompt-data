The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The original value of `n` (the length of the list `a`) is preserved, but the contents of `a` are updated to reflect the new list of integers. The variable `n` is no longer directly accessible through its initial state, but we know that `len(a)` will be equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), and `a` is updated to the list of integers entered by the user.**
