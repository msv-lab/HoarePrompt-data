`mex` is incremented by 1. Since `mex` was initially 1, after the increment, `mex` becomes 2. The values of `a`, `n`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mex` is 2, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to 1**
