The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), after executing this line of code, `n` will still be within this range, but its exact value will be the one input by the user. The variable `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)**
