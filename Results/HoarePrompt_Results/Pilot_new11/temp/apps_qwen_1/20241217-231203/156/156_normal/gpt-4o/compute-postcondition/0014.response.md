Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive even integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is in the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`. If `k < n - 1`, then `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `full_rows` is calculated as `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is calculated as `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is determined as `n - full_rows`, and `col` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `full_rows % 2 == 0` or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows % 2 != 0`. Finally, `row, col` are printed.***
