Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is exactly equal to `n * 2 - 2`. According to the problem description, when `k` reaches `n * 2 - 2`, Lara should be in cell `(1, 2)`. However, the current implementation checks if `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2` but does not cover the exact case where `k` equals `n * 2 - 2`. This results in incorrect output for some values of `k`.

For example, if `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 8` (which is `n * 2 - 2`), the expected output is `(1, 2)`, but the program will compute it as:
```
if k < n - 1:  # 8 < 3 is False
if k < n * 2 - 2:  # 8 < 8 is True
    # computes the wrong cell (3, 2) instead of (1, 2)
```

To fix this, the program should handle the exact case where `k == n * 2 - 2` separately.
