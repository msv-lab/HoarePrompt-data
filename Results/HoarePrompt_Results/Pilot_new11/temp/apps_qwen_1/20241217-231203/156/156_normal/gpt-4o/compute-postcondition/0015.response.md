The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that `n` is even.
- `k` is an integer such that `0 <= k < n * m`.

Based on the given output cases, there are no specific return values mentioned, but we know that the function should handle the constraint `0 <= k < n * m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three parameters where `n` and `m` are positive integers with `n` being even, and `k` is an integer within the range from 0 to `n * m - 1`, and return a value based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an even positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), and `k` (an integer such that `0 <= k < n * m`), and returns a value based on these parameters.**
