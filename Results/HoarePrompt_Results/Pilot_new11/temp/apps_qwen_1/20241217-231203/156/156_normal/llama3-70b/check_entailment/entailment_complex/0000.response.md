Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It ensures that the input values satisfy the constraints \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and \(n\) and \(m\) are even.
   - \(k\) is constrained by \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\).

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly reduces \(k\) using `k %= n * 2 - 2`. This is necessary because the movement pattern of Lara can be repeated every \(n \cdot 2 - 2\) steps, and this operation ensures that the value of \(k\) is within a manageable range for further calculations.

3. **Movement Pattern**:
   - The program accurately simulates Lara's movement in the dungeon:
     - Lara starts at cell \((1, 1)\).
     - She moves down to cell \((n, 1)\).
     - She then moves in a snake pattern (right, up, left, up, etc.) until she reaches cell \((1, 2)\).

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - For \(0 \leq k < n - 1\):
     - The program correctly prints \((k + 1, 1)\), which corresponds to her movement down the first column.
   - For \(n - 1 \leq k < n \cdot 2 - 2\):
     - The program correctly calculates and prints the coordinates based on the snake pattern movement. Specifically, it uses the formulas \(2n - k - 2\) and \(\frac{k - n + 1}{n - 1} + 1\) to determine the row and column.
   - For \(k \geq n \cdot 2 - 2\):
     - The program correctly prints \((1, 2)\), which is the final cell Lara reaches.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that \(k\) is properly adjusted and the correct output is produced.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
