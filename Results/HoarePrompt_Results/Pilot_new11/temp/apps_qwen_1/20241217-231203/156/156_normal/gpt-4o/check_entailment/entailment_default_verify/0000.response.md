Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly implements the logic to determine Lara's current position in the dungeon after \( k \) moves. The output hints clearly outline the two main scenarios handled by the function `func_1`:
1. If \( k < n - 1 \), the program correctly identifies that Lara is still in the first column and prints the corresponding row and column.
2. If \( k \geq n - 1 \), the program accurately calculates the number of full rows and remaining steps to determine the final position in the snake-like pattern. 

The original assessment is accurate because the program handles all specified cases correctly, including the implicit handling of \( k == n - 1 \) in the subsequent logic. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.
