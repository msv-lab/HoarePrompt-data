`k` is decremented by `n - 1`. Since `k` was initially in the range `[n - 1, n * m)`, subtracting `n - 1` from `k` will adjust its value accordingly. After the subtraction, `k` will be within the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`. Given that `k` was originally greater than or equal to `n - 1`, after decrementing by `n - 1`, `k` will now be within the range `[0, n * m - (n - 1))`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a value in the range [0, n * m - (n - 1))**
