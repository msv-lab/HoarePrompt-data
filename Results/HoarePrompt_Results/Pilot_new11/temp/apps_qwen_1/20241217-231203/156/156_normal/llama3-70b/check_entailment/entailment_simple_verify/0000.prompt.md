You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `k` falls within the range `[n-1, n*2-3]`. According to the problem description, when `k` is in this range, Lara should be moving upwards from the middle of the matrix towards the top. However, the program's logic for this range is incorrect. Specifically, the line `print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)` does not correctly calculate the row and column for this segment of `k`.

For example, consider the input `n=4`, `m=3`, and `k=8`:

- The program calculates `k % (n * 2 - 2)`, which gives `8 % 6 = 2`.
- Since `2 < n - 1`, it incorrectly prints `(2 + 1, 1)`, which is `(3, 1)`, instead of the correct position `(3, 2)`.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for certain values of `k`, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are even and positive integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `m` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\) and `k` is updated to be `k % (n * 2 - 2)\), and `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and the output is determined as follows:
        #- If \( k < n * 2 - 2 \), the output consists of two numbers: \( 2n - k - 2 \) and \( (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1 \).
        #- If \( k \geq n * 2 - 2 \), the output is 1 and 2.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `m` is an even and positive integer within the range [2, \(10^9\)], `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\). If `k < n - 1`, then `k` is incremented by 1 and 1 is printed. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k % (n * 2 - 2)`, and the output is determined as follows:
    #- If \(0 \leq k < n * 2 - 2\), the output consists of two numbers: \(2n - k - 2\) and \(\frac{k - n + 1}{n - 1} + 1\).
    #- If \(k \geq n * 2 - 2\), the output is 1 and 2.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
