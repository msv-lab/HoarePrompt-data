Functionality: **The function reads three real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from standard input, where each number has exactly one digit after the decimal point and lies within the range \([0.1, 200.0]\). It then calculates 12 different mathematical expressions involving exponentiation of these numbers in various orders. The function determines which of these expressions yields the maximum value and prints the corresponding expression string. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input values do not have exactly one digit after the decimal point, the `map(float, input().split())` line will raise a `ValueError`. However, the function does not handle this case explicitly.
- If the input values are outside the specified range \([0.1, 200.0]\), the function will proceed with the calculations without any validation, which might lead to unexpected results or errors depending on the specific values.

In summary, the function reads the input, processes it, and prints the expression that results in the maximum value among the evaluated expressions.
