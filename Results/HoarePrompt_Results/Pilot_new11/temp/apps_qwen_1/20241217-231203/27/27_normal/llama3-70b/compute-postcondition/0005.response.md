The code `a5 = y ** x ** z` calculates `a5` as `y` raised to the power of `x ** z`. However, the initial values of `y`, `x`, and `z` are not specified in the initial state. Since these values are required to compute the final value of `a5`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a5` without knowing `y`, `x`, and `z`. The states of the other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is `x`, `a2` is `x`, `a3` is `x`, `a4` is `(x`, `a5` is `y ** x ** z**.
