The code `x, y, z = map(float, input().split())` reads three space-separated values from the input, converts them to floats, and assigns them to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, but we know they are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, such that `0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, such that `0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0`, and their values are determined by the input split and converted to floats.**
