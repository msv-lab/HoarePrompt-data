Let's break down the given information and the loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 2

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 2

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.
   - This means the loop will start with `j = i + 1`, which is `4` in this case.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to `4` (since `j` starts at `4`).
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least `4`.

### Required Adjustments:
- `total` remains `0` since it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `i` remains `3` since it is not involved in the loop condition.
- `n` must be adjusted to ensure the loop can start and continue. Specifically, `n` must be at least `4`.

### Final State:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4**
