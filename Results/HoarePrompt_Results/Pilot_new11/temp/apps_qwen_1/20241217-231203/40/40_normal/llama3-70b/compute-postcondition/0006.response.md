Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` must be less than `n`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j` (where `i <= j <= len(s)`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse)***
