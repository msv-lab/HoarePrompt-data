Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `max_len` is 0.

### Loop Analysis
The loop consists of two nested loops:
1. The outer loop iterates over each starting index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
2. The inner loop iterates over each ending index `j` from `i+1` to `n`.

For each combination of `i` and `j`, a substring `substr` is extracted from `s` using `s[i:j]`. The loop checks if this substring is not equal to its reverse (`substr != substr[::-1]`). If it is not equal, the length of this substring is compared with `max_len`, and if it is greater, `max_len` is updated to this new length.

### Iteration Analysis
- **First Iteration**:
  - `i` starts at 0.
  - `j` ranges from 1 to `n`.
  - The loop extracts substrings `s[0:1]`, `s[0:2]`, ..., `s[0:n]` and checks if they are not palindromes.
  - `max_len` is updated if a non-palindromic substring is found with a greater length.

- **Second Iteration**:
  - `i` starts at 1.
  - `j` ranges from 2 to `n`.
  - The loop extracts substrings `s[1:2]`, `s[1:3]`, ..., `s[1:n]` and checks if they are not palindromes.
  - `max_len` is updated if a non-palindromic substring is found with a greater length.

- **General Iteration**:
  - For each `i`, `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n`.
  - The loop extracts substrings `s[i:i+1]`, `s[i:i+2]`, ..., `s[i:n]` and checks if they are not palindromes.
  - `max_len` is updated if a non-palindromic substring is found with a greater length.

### Final State After All Iterations
After the loop completes, the value of `max_len` will be the maximum length of any substring in `s` that is not a palindrome. The variables `i` and `j` will hold their final values, but these values do not affect the final state of `max_len` directly.

### Output State
- `max_len` will be the maximum length of any substring in `s` that is not a palindrome.
- `i` and `j` will hold their final values, which are not specified but will be valid indices within the range `[0, n)` for `i` and `[i+1, n+1)` for `j`.
- `s` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

Output State: **`max_len` is the maximum length of any substring in `s` that is not a palindrome, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop completes, `j` is the final value of `j` after the loop completes, and `s` is the original string.**
