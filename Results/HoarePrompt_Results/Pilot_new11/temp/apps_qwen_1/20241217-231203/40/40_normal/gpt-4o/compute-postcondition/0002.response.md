Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, otherwise it returns `False`. The function correctly handles the case where the string is empty, which is not explicitly mentioned in the initial annotations but is implied by the palindrome definition. However, the function does not handle the case where the string contains spaces or other non-lowercase English letters, although these are not specified in the initial description and thus are not included in the functionality. The function also correctly checks the entire length of the string for palindromicity.**
