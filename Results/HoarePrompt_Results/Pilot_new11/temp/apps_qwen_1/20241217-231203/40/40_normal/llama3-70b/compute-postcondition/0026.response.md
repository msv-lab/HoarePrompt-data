`max_len` is assigned the maximum value between `max_len` and `len(substr)`. Since `substr` is a substring of `s` from index 3 to index 4, its length is 2. The value of `max_len` is initially unknown, but it will be updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is 0 since it is not initialized) and 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 4, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index 3 to index 4, `max_len` is 2.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 4, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index 3 to index 4, `max_len` is 2**
