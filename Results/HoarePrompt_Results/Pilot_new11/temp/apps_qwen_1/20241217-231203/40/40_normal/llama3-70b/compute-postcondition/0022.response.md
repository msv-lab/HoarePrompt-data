The code `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))` updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum between `max_len` and the length of `substr`. Since `max_len` is not initialized in the given state, it defaults to `0`. The length of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, and its length is at least 1 (since it is a non-empty string).

After executing the code, `max_len` will be updated to the length of `substr`, which is at least 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, the substring `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is the length of `substr`**
