The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` creates a substring from the string `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1`. This does not change the values of `s`, `n`, `max_len`, `i`, or `j`. It simply assigns the new substring to the variable `substr`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is either equal to the length of `substr` (if `substr` is not equal to its reverse) or remains 0 (if `substr` is equal to its reverse), `i` must be less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `substr` is a substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j-1` (where `i <= j-1 <= len(s)`).**
