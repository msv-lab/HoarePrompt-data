Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the longest non-palindrome substring. Specifically, the program only checks a few substrings (the entire string, the substring starting from the second character, and the substring ending at the second last character) and prints the length of the longest among them if they are not palindromes. However, it does not guarantee that it finds the longest non-palindrome substring in all cases.

For example, consider the input `mamad`. The longest non-palindrome substring here is `mad`, which has a length of 3. The program, however, will check:
- The entire string `mamad` (which is a palindrome).
- The substring starting from the second character `amad` (which is not a palindrome and has a length of 4).

Since `func_1(s)` returns `False` for `mamad` (it's a palindrome), the program will print the length of `amad` as the result, which is 4. However, the correct output should be 3, as `mad` is the longest non-palindrome substring.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
