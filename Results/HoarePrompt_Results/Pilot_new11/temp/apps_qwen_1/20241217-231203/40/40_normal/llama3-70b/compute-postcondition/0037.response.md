The code updates `max_len` to be the maximum value between `max_len` and the length of `substr`. However, the initial value of `max_len` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value after the code runs. But we know that `max_len` will be updated to be at least the length of `substr`.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is 4
- `n` is greater than or equal to 5
- `j` is 5
- `substr` is the character at index 4 in `s`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse

The only change in this code is to `max_len`. Since the initial value of `max_len` is not specified, we assume it could be anything. However, `max_len` will now be at least the length of `substr`, which is 1 (since `substr` is a single character).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5, `substr` is the character at index 4 in `s`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse, and `max_len` is at least 1.**
