According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop condition is `j < n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 6, `substr` is `s[4] + s[5]`, `substr` is not equal to its reverse, and `max_len` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is currently 6, `j` needs to be incremented to 7 (or any value less than `n + 1`). Also, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` remains 4, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5, `j` is incremented to 7, `substr` remains `s[4] + s[5]`, and `substr` is still not equal to its reverse, and `max_len` remains 2.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 7, `substr` is `s[4] + s[5]`, `substr` is not equal to its reverse, and `max_len` is 2**
