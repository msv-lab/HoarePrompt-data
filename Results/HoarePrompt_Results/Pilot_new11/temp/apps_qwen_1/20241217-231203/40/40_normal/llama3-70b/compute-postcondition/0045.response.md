The code snippet `max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))` updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum between its current value and the length of `substr`. Given the initial state:

- `total` is 0
- `i` is 4
- `n` is greater than or equal to 5
- `j` is 7
- `substr` is `s[4] + s[5] + s[6]`
- `max_len` is 2

Since `substr` is `s[4] + s[5] + s[6]`, its length `len(substr)` will be 3 (assuming each element in the string `s` is a single character).

Therefore, `max_len` will be updated to `max(2, 3)`, which is 3.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 7, `substr` is `s[4] + s[5] + s[6]`, `max_len` is 3**
