The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func():`. The parameter constraint mentioned (n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^18) does not apply since the function does not take any parameters. 

Given the output cases provided, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing context. However, based on the given information:

- Case_1: There is no specific return related to this case since no specific input is mentioned.
- Case_2: The function will return a value based on the condition of the input `n`.

Since the function does not accept any parameters, the functionality description should reflect that.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not have a return value defined in the given context.**
