The code `print(n.bit_length() - 1)` calculates the bit length of `n` and subtracts 1 from it. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Subtracting 1 from this value gives the highest power of 2 that fits into `n`.

Given that `n` is an integer input by the user such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, the bit length of `n` ranges from 1 to 60. Therefore, `n.bit_length() - 1` will range from 0 to 59.

Since the value of `n` itself is not printed, only the calculated value is returned, and the original value of `n` is not modified, the output state remains the same except for the print statement's effect.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, the value of `n.bit_length() - 1` is printed.**
