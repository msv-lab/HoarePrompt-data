The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, this constraint still holds after the code is executed. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
