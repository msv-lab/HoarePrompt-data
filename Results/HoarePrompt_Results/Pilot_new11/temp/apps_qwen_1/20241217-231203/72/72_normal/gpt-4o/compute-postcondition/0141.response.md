The code `max_questions += 1` increments the value of `max_questions` by 1. Based on the initial state, `max_questions` must still be greater than 0, and the conditions related to `row` and `col` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`col` is 1, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1, and `row` is either `-1` or `1`.**
