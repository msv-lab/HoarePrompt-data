The code reads five integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. The initial conditions are that these variables are integers within specified ranges. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` will be the integers provided as input, and the conditions on their ranges will still hold.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, 1 ≤ `y` ≤ `m`, with `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` now holding the values input by the user.**
