Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - \(1 \leq x - 1 \leq n\)
   - \(n\) is as per its initial condition
   - \(m\) is as per its initial condition
   - \(k\) is as per its initial condition
   - \(y\) is decreased by 1
   - \(full\_cycle\_length = (2 * n - 2) * m\)
   - \(full\_cycles = \frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m}\)
   - \(remaining\_questions = K \% ((2 * n - 2) * m)\)
   - \(min\_questions = \frac{k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)}{2 * n - 2}\)
   - \(max\_questions = \left(\frac{k}{(2 * n - 2) * m} + n - 1\right) // (2 * n - 2)\) if \(n > 1\)
   - \(sergei\_questions\) is calculated based on conditions involving \(x\) and \(full\_cycles\)
   - \(row = 0\)
   - \(direction = 1\)

2. **For Loop:**
   ```
   for _ in range(remaining_questions):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `remaining_questions` is greater than 0.
   - The loop body is executed for each value in the range from 0 to `remaining_questions - 1`.

4. **Identifying Necessary Adjustments:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0.
   - The other provided states (`x`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, `row`, and `direction`) are not directly required to determine the loop's ability to execute; they provide context for the loop body but do not affect the loop's execution condition.

### Conclusion:

The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `remaining_questions`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0**
