The code `n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes five space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. This means that the initial values of these variables are replaced by the values entered as input. However, since the exact input values are not specified in the initial state, we will represent them in terms of their input values.

The initial conditions are:
- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`
- `1 ≤ x ≤ n`
- `1 ≤ y ≤ m`

After executing the code, these conditions will still hold true because the new values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are derived from valid inputs.

Output State: **`1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, `1 ≤ x ≤ n`, `1 ≤ y ≤ m`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `x` is the fourth input integer, `y` is the fifth input integer**
