The code assigns `-1` to the variable `direction`. This assignment does not affect the values of `remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, `row`, `sergei_questions`, or `max_questions`. Therefore, the only change is the new value of `direction`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `row` is equal to `n`, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`, otherwise remains unchanged, `max_questions` is `max_questions + 1`, `direction` is -1.**
