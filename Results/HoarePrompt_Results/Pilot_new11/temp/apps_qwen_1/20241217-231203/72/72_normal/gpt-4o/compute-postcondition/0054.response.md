To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions and changes that occur within the loop based on the given information.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - The current value of `col` is 1.
   - The value of `direction` can vary, but it does not directly affect the continuation of the loop in this context.
   - The loop will continue as long as `remaining_questions > 0` and `m > 0`.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - For each `col` in the range `range(m)`, the loop body is omitted here but we know the following happens inside:
     - `max_questions` is incremented by 1.
     - `row` is set to -2 and `direction` is set to -1 if `row` equals `n`.
     - Otherwise, `row` is increased by `direction`.
     - If `direction` is not 1, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.
     - `max_questions` is decreased by 1.
     - `row` is either `row + 2` or `row + 1`, depending on whether `row == -1`.
     - `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `col` starts from 1, the next value of `col` will be 2.
   - We need to ensure that `remaining_questions > 0` and `m > 0` still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

- **Remaining Questions:** This value does not change inside the loop and must remain greater than 0.
- **m (number of columns):** This value does not change inside the loop and must remain greater than 0.
- **col:** The next value of `col` will be 2, as it started from 1.

Since the loop continues as long as `remaining_questions > 0` and `m > 0`, and these conditions are not affected by the loop itself, the only change needed is in the value of `col`.

### Conclusion:

State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `col` is 2.**

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
```
State: **remaining_questions must be greater than 0, m must be greater than 0, and the current value of col is 2**
```
