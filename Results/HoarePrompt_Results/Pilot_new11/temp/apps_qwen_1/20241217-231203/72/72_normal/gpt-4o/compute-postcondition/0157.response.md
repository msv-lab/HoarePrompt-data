The code assigns `-1` to the variable `direction`. The values of `col`, `remaining_questions`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, and `row` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`col` is 2, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value plus 2, `row` is either -1 or 1; `direction` is -1**
