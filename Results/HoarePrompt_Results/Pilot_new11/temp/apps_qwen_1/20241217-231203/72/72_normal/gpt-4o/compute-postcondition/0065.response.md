The code `row += 2` increments the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state, `row` was previously equal to `x`, and it is now increased by `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `col` is 2; if `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1; `max_questions` is decreased by 1; `row` is increased by 2; `direction` is 1.**
