`row` is incremented by `direction`. The value of `direction` is not specified in the initial state, but since `row` is either `-1` or `1`, adding `direction` to `row` will simply confirm that `row` remains either `-1` or `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`col` is 1, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1, and `row` is either `-1` or `1`.**
