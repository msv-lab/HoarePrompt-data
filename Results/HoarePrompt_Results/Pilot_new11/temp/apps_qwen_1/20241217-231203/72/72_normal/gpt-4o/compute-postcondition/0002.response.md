`y` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `x` is `x - 1`, which means `x` is now `x - 1`. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `1 ≤ x ≤ n`; `x` is `x - 1`; `n`, `m`, `k`, `y` are as per their initial conditions, and `y` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`1 ≤ x ≤ n`; `x` is `x - 1`; `n`, `m`, `k`, `y` are as per their initial conditions, and `y` is decreased by 1.**
