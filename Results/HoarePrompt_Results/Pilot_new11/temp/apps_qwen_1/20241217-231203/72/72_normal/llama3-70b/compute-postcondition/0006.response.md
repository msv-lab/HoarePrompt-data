Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts five integer parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. It calculates and prints three values based on these parameters: `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked`. The calculations involve determining the maximum and minimum number of times a certain action can be performed given the constraints, and calculating the specific action performed by a character named Sergei. The function does not return any value but modifies the output stream by printing the calculated values. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs for `k` (e.g., negative values), which are not handled in the code. Additionally, the code assumes valid ranges for `x` and `y` (1 to `n` and 1 to `m` respectively), but does not explicitly check these conditions.**
