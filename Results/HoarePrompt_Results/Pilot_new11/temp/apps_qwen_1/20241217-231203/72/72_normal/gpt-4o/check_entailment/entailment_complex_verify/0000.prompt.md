You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario when the remaining questions (`remaining_questions`) are less than the full cycle length but greater than or equal to the half-cycle length. Specifically, the program's logic for updating `max_questions` and `min_questions` during the remaining questions phase is flawed.

Consider the following case:
- Input: `4 2 9 4 2`
- Expected output: `2 1 1`

The program calculates the full cycles and remaining questions correctly, but the logic for updating `max_questions` and `min_questions` during the remaining questions phase is incorrect. The program increments `max_questions` and decrements it without properly accounting for the direction of the polling, which leads to an incorrect result.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:
- The full cycle length for 4 rows and 2 columns is `(2 * 4 - 2) * 2 = 12`.
- The full cycles are `9 // 12 = 0` with `9 % 12 = 9` remaining questions.
- During the remaining questions, the program incorrectly updates `max_questions` and `min_questions`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the remaining questions phase by properly updating `max_questions` and `min_questions` based on the current direction and the remaining questions.

Since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Otherwise, the values remain as per the initial conditions specified in the precondition.

If \(x\) is neither 0 nor \(n - 1\), then \(\text{sergei_questions} = \frac{\text{k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)}}{2 * \text{n} - 2} + (1 \text{ if } \text{full_cycles \% (2 * n - 2)} \geq x \text{ else } 0)\).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `remaining_questions` is 0, `m` is the number of columns, `sergei_questions` is the total number of times the condition `row == x` and `col == y` is met, `max_questions` is the maximum value of `sergei_questions` plus the number of times the loop runs if `direction == 1`, and `max_questions` is the number of times the loop runs minus 1 if `direction != 1`, `row` is the final position of `row` after the last iteration, and `direction` is the final value of `direction`.
    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)
#Overall this is what the function does:- If \(n = 1\), the `full_cycle_length` calculation is incorrect because it should be simply \(m\). This should be adjusted to handle this case correctly.
- The annotation mentions that `sergei_questions` is updated in the if-else block, but the code logic is incomplete. Specifically, the code snippet inside the else block is missing the closing parenthesis for the ternary operation, which could lead to incorrect results.
- The `full_cycle_length` should be recalculated as \(m\) when \(n = 1\).
- The `sergei_questions` calculation in the else block should be completed to ensure correct logic.

Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
