The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. This changes the value of `direction`, but does not affect the values of `row`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, or `max_questions`. The initial conditions provided are still valid.

Output State: **`row` is equal to `x + -1`, `col` is equal to `y`, `sergei_questions` is set to `initial_value + 1` if `x + -1 == x and y == y` is true, else `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `max_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is `-1`**
