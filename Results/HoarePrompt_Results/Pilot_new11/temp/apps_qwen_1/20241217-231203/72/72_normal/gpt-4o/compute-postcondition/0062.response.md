`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The value of `remaining_questions` and `m` remains unchanged, and the condition for incrementing `sergei_questions` remains the same (if `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1). Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0; `m` must be greater than 0; the current value of `col` is 2; if `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1; `max_questions` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0; `m` must be greater than 0; the current value of `col` is 2; if `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1; `max_questions` is decreased by 1**
