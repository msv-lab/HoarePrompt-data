`x` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `n` is the first input integer. After decrementing `x` by 1, `x` will still satisfy the condition `1 ≤ x ≤ n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`1 ≤ x ≤ n`; `x` is `x - 1`; `n`, `m`, `k`, `y` are as per their initial conditions**
