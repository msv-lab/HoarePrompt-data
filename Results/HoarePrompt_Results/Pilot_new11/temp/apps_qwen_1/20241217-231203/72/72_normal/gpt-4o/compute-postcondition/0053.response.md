Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `col` is 1. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is set to -2 and `direction` is set to -1 if `row` equals `n`. Otherwise, `row` is increased by `direction`. If `direction` is not 1, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `row` is either `row + 2` or `row + 1`, depending on whether `row == -1`, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.***
