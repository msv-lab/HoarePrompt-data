Postcondition: ***`col` is 2, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1, `row` must still be either -2 or 2. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true whether the if condition `row == x and col == y` is true or false.***
