Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where `k` is less than the total number of pupils in the classroom. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions asked without considering the remaining questions after the full rounds of asking are completed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3 4 2 2
```

According to the problem description:
- The order of asking is: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).
- Since `k=4`, the teacher asks: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1).

In this case:
- The maximum number of questions asked is 2 (pupils (1,3) and (2,1)).
- The minimum number of questions asked is 1 (pupils (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2)).
- Sergei (2,2) is asked 1 time.

However, the program incorrectly calculates these values. Let's break down the calculation:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
```

For `k=4`, `n=3`, `m=3`, `x=2`, `y=2`:
- `max_asked = (4 + 2) // 6 = 1`
- `min_asked = max(1, 1 - 2) = 1`
- `sergei_asked = (4 + 2 - 1) // 6 + ((4 + 2 - 1) % 6 >= 3) = 1 + 1 = 2`

These calculations do not match the expected results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
