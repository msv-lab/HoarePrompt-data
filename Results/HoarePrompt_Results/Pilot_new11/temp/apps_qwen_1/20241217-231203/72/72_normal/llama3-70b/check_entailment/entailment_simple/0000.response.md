Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked using a formula that does not accurately reflect the actual polling pattern described. Let's break down why:

1. **Polling Pattern**:
   - The teacher asks pupils in a zigzag pattern, starting from the first row and moving up and down.
   - For an even number of rows (`n`), the pattern is: 1st row, 2nd row, ..., nth row, (n-1)th row, ..., 2nd row, 1st row, ...
   - For an odd number of rows (`n`), the pattern is similar but the middle row is asked twice in a full cycle: 1st row, 2nd row, ..., (n-1)th row, nth row, (n-1)th row, ..., 2nd row, 1st row, ...

2. **Calculations in the Program**:
   - `max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`:
     - This formula assumes a uniform distribution of questions across all pupils, which is not accurate for the zigzag pattern.
   - `min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`:
     - This formula is also based on a uniform distribution and does not account for the zigzag pattern.
   - `sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`:
     - This formula attempts to calculate the number of times Sergei is asked, but it still does not correctly simulate the zigzag pattern.

To properly implement the logic, the program needs to simulate the zigzag pattern and keep track of the number of times each pupil is asked. Hereâ€™s a more detailed approach to solve the problem:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize counters
    total_questions = [0] * (n * m)
    max_count, min_count, sergi_count = 0, float('inf'), 0
    
    # Simulate the polling pattern
    current_row = 1
    row_direction = 1
    question_count = 0
    
    while question_count < k:
        for col in range(m):
            total_questions[(current_row - 1) * m + col] += 1
            question_count += 1
            if (current_row == x and col + 1 == y):
                sergi_count += 1
            if question_count == k:
                break
        current_row += row_direction
        if current_row == 1 or current_row == n:
            row_direction *= -1
    
    # Calculate max and min counts
    max_count = max(total_questions)
    min_count = min(total_questions)
    
    print(max_count, min_count, sergi_count)

# Call the function
func()
```

This implementation correctly simulates the zigzag pattern and ensures that the calculations for the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's count are accurate. Therefore, the original program is incorrect because it does not follow the described polling pattern.
