Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked (`min_asked`). According to the problem description and the expected outputs, the minimum number of questions a pupil is asked should be influenced by the symmetry in the asking pattern. However, the current implementation does not account for the full symmetry, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

For example, consider the second test case provided:
```
4 2 9 4 2
```
The correct output should be:
```
2 1 1
```
However, the given code produces:
```
2 2 1
```

This discrepancy arises because the formula used to calculate `min_asked` does not properly account for the full symmetry in the asking pattern. Specifically, the current implementation uses:
```python
min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
```
This formula does not correctly reflect the minimum number of questions a pupil can be asked, especially when considering the full pattern of asking.

To fix this, a more accurate calculation for `min_asked` is needed, taking into account the full symmetry of the asking pattern. A revised approach would be to consider the number of complete cycles and the remainder after those cycles, ensuring the calculation accurately reflects the minimum number of questions a pupil can be asked.
