`sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. The value of `remaining_questions`, `m`, `row`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, `row`, and `direction` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is unchanged, `row` is unchanged, `direction` is unchanged, the current value of `row` is equal to `x`, and the current value of `col` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is unchanged, `row` is unchanged, `direction` is unchanged, the current value of `row` is equal to `x`, and the current value of `col` is equal to `y**.
