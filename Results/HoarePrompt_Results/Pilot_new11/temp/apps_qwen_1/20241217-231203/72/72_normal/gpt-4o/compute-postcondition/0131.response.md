`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The value of `remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, `max_questions`, `row`, and `direction` remains unchanged. The current value of `row` is still equal to `x`, and the current value of `col` is still equal to `y` since the condition `direction != 1` holds true.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is equal to its initial value minus 1, `row` is equal to `x`, `direction` is unchanged, and the current value of `row` is equal to `x` and the current value of `col` is equal to `y` since the condition `direction != 1` holds true.**
