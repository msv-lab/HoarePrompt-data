`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The value of `max_questions` is its initial value plus 1, so after decrementing by 1, `max_questions` is now equal to its initial value. The conditions for `col`, `remaining_questions`, `m`, `sergei_questions`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value, `row` must still be either -2 or 2.

Output State: **`col` is 2, `remaining_questions` must still be greater than 0, `m` must still be greater than 0, `sergei_questions` is equal to its initial value plus 1, `max_questions` is its initial value, `row` must still be either -2 or 2.**
