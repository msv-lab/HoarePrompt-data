Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func()` correctly implements the logic for calculating the maximum, minimum, and specific count of questions asked to each student based on the given order. The formulas used for `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` are appropriate and handle various scenarios, including edge cases such as a single row and large values of `k`.

The output hints confirm that the function accepts five integer parameters and prints the required values without returning anything. Although the code does not explicitly handle invalid inputs for `k` (e.g., negative values), the problem statement specifies that the input will be valid, so this omission does not affect the correctness of the program under the given assumptions.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
