Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` must be greater than 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `col` is 2; if `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1; `max_questions` is decreased by 1; `row` is increased by 2; `direction` is 1. Since the condition `row == -1` is not specified as true, the overall postcondition remains as the condition in the if part.***
