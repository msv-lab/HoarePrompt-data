Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\). It checks if `n` is less than 6. If true, it returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through values of `a` from 1 to \(\frac{n}{4}\), setting `b` to `a` and calculating `rem` as `n - 2(a + b)`. It counts the number of valid `(a, b)` pairs where `rem` is greater than 0 and even, and not equal to `a`. After the loop, it returns the count of such valid pairs.**

This summary covers all potential cases and includes the missing functionality, ensuring that the final state of the program after it concludes is accurately described.
