Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in this case is `a`, which is initialized to 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n // 2 + 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop condition is `1 <= a < n // 2 + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must start from 1 (which it does) and the upper limit `n // 2 + 1` must be greater than 1.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
   - `ways` is initially 0.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - Since `a` starts from 1, the initial value of `a` is already correct.
   - The critical factor for the loop to execute is that `n // 2 + 1` must be greater than 1. This simplifies to checking if `n >= 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Given the constraints on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needed to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `ways` is 0**.
