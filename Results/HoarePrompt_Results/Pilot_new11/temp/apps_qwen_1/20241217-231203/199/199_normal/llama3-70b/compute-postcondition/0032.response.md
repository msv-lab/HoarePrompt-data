Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is the next value in the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\), `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) plus 1 if `a != b` and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\) holds. Otherwise, `ways` remains unchanged.***
