Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Loop Logic**:
   - The outer loop iterates over \(a\) from 1 to \(n // 2\).
   - The inner loop iterates over \(b\) from \(a\) to \((n - a) // 2\).
   - A pair \((a, b)\) is considered valid if \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initially, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^9\).
   - `ways` starts at 0.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each valid pair \((a, b)\) found during the loop, `ways` is incremented by 1.

4. **Final State**:
   - After all possible iterations of the loops, `ways` will hold the count of all valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).
   - Since the loop checks all possible pairs up to \(n // 2\), if no valid pairs are found, `ways` remains 0.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(n\) is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `ways` remains 0.
   - If \(n\) is exactly 2, the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), but since \(a \neq b\), no valid pairs exist, so `ways` remains 0.
   - For \(n \geq 4\), the loop will find valid pairs until it exhausts all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Regardless of the number of iterations, `ways` will be the count of all valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless it was initially invalid (less than 2), in which case `ways` will still be 0.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).**
