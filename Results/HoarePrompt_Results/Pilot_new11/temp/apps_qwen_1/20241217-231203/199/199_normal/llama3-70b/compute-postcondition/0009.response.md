Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `ways` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether there exists a `b` such that `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`.
   - `b` will be the next value in the range starting from 1 up to `(n - a) // 2`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Range for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts at `a` and goes up to `(n - a) // 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 1, so the next value of `b` would start from 1 and go up to `(n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Check Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `b` must be within the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]`.
   - Since `a` is 1, the next value of `b` will be 1 (if it hasn't already been incremented), and the upper limit will be `(n - 1) // 2`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `a` remains 1.
   - `ways` remains the same as long as there is no new valid `b` found in the next iteration.
   - `b` will be incremented to the next value in the range.

6. **New State:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `ways` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether there exists a `b` such that `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`.
   - `b` will be 1 (if it hasn't already been incremented).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is 1, `ways` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether there exists a `b` such that `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`, `b` will be 1.**
