Let's analyze the given code and the initial state step by step to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Code
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial State
- `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2.
- `a` is the last value used in the loop plus 1.
- `b` is the first value within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\).
- `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `b` is within the specified range, i.e., from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `b`**:
   - `b` is set to be the first value within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\). This means `b` must be at least `a` and less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must satisfy the condition `a <= b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - If `a` is greater than `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, then there are no values of `b` that satisfy this condition, and the loop will not execute.

4. **Ensuring Validity**:
   - We need to ensure that there exists at least one value of `b` that satisfies the condition. This implies that `a` should be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

5. **Other States**:
   - The state of `ways` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution but will be updated within the loop based on the condition \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are the key states that affect the loop's execution.

### Conclusion

For the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.

### Final State

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `a` is less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`, `b` is the first value within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\), `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\)**
