Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The goal is to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.
   - For a rectangle to be formed, the four parts must have at least two different lengths.
   - For a square to be formed, all four parts must be of the same length.

2. **Current Implementation Issues:**
   - The program only considers the case where `a = b`, i.e., the first two parts are of equal length. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that a rectangle can be formed and a square cannot.
   - The logic inside the `for` loop checks if `rem` (the remaining length after accounting for the first two parts) is greater than 0 and even, and if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. This logic does not cover all valid configurations of lengths that can form a rectangle but not a square.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to consider all possible values for the four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.
   - Specifically, we need to ensure that the four parts are distinct or at least two pairs of parts are the same while ensuring no pair is identical (to avoid forming a square).

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a, n // 4 + 1):
            c = (n - a - b) // 2
            d = n - a - b - c
            if a <= b <= c <= d and a != b and b != c and c != d:
                count += 1
    return count
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Function:
- **Outer Loop (`a`):** Represents the length of the first part.
- **Inner Loop (`b`):** Represents the length of the second part, starting from `a` to ensure `a <= b`.
- **Calculate Remaining Lengths (`c` and `d`):** The remaining length is split between `c` and `d` such that `c + d = n - a - b`.
- **Check Conditions:** Ensure `a <= b <= c <= d` to form a rectangle and `a != b`, `b != c`, `c != d` to avoid forming a square.

This approach ensures that all valid configurations are considered, and the constraints of forming a rectangle but not a square are properly enforced.
