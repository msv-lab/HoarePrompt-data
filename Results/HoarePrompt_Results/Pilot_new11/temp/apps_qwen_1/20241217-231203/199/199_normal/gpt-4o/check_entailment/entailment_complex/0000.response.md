Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the steps and verify each aspect:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` from the input, ensuring it is a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9). The input handling is assumed to be valid as per the problem constraints.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if `n` is less than 6. If `n` is less than 6, it returns 0 because it's impossible to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. This check ensures that the function only proceeds when `n` is at least 6.

3. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - For each value of `a` from 1 to `n // 4`, the program sets `b` to `a` and calculates the remaining length `rem` as `n - 2 * (a + b)`.
   - The condition `rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0` ensures that `rem` is a positive even number, which means the remaining part can be divided into two equal segments.
   - The additional condition `a != rem // 2` ensures that the parts are not all equal, thus preventing the formation of a square.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The variable `count` is incremented for each valid pair `(a, b)` that satisfies the conditions above.
   - Finally, the function returns the count of such valid pairs.

### Verification:
- **Rectangular Formation**: The condition `rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0` ensures that the remaining part can be split into two equal segments, forming a rectangle.
- **Non-Square Formation**: The condition `a != rem // 2` ensures that the four parts are not all equal, preventing the formation of a square.

Since the program correctly implements the logic required to meet the problem description and handles all cases as specified, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is **True**.
