Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2.
- `a` is the last value used in the loop plus 1.
- `b` is the first value within the range \([a, (n - a) // 2 + 1)\).
- `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).

### Loop Code:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
        ways += 1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a` up to \((n - a) // 2 + 1 - 1\).
- For each value of `b`, it checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and if \(2 \times (a + b) == n\). If both conditions are met, `ways` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `a` will be updated to the last value it had during the loop, which is the value of `b` after the loop finishes (or remains unchanged if the loop did not run at all).

### Final State:
- `a` will be the last value of `b` evaluated by the loop, or the original value of `a` if the loop does not execute at all.
- `b` will not exist as a meaningful variable after the loop since it is overwritten in each iteration.
- `ways` will be the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\), incremented by 1 for each valid pair found.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop runs at least once, `a` will be the last value of `b` evaluated by the loop.
- If the loop does not run at all (i.e., no valid pairs are found), `a` will remain its initial value.
- `ways` will be the total count of valid pairs found during the loop execution.

### Output State:
**Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `a` is the last value of `b` evaluated by the loop or the initial value of `a` if the loop does not run, `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) == n\).**
