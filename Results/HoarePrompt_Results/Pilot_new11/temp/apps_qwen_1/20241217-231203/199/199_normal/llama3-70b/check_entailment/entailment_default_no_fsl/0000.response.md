Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the code only considers pairs `(a, b)` where `a <= b`, which means it fails to account for cases where `b < a`. According to the problem description, both `a` and `b` should be able to take any value as long as `a != b` and `2 * (a + b) == n`.

For example, consider the input `20`. The correct output should be `4` because there are four valid ways to split the stick: `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. However, the current implementation only finds `{4, 4, 6, 6}` because it iterates over `a` and `b` such that `a <= b`. This means it misses the other valid cases like `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, and `{3, 3, 7, 7}`.

To fix this, the code should iterate over both `a` and `b` without the constraint `a <= b`:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
            if a != b and 2 * (a + b) == n:
                ways += 1
    return ways
```

This corrected version ensures that all valid pairs `(a, b)` are considered, thus providing the correct output for all potential cases.
