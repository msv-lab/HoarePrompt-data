The code `positions.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `positions`. Before the code executes, `i` is increased by `2 * k + 1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `5 + 2 * k`.

Let's break it down:

1. Initially, `i` is increased by `2 * k + 1`. So, the new value of `i` is `i + 2 * k + 1`.
2. The `append` method adds this new value of `i` to the list `positions`.

After the code executes, the value of `i` is `i + 2 * k + 1`, and the value of `n` remains unchanged. The list `positions` now includes the original value of `i` plus the newly added value of `i + 2 * k + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `5 + 2 * k`; `positions` contains `i` and `i + 2 * k + 1`; `i` is increased by `2 * k + 1`**
