The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000, but since the function definition does not include any parameters, it does not actually accept any inputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters.**
