The code appends a value to the list `res`. The value being appended is `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, where `i` is an index that would typically be provided in a loop context (such as a `for` loop), but its specific value is not given here. However, we know the following:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\)
- `n > k + 2`

Since `i` is not defined in the given code snippet, let's assume `i` is some integer. The value that gets appended to `res` is calculated as `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`. We cannot determine the exact value of `res` without knowing `i`, but we can state that `res` now contains this value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\), and `n > k + 2`; `res` is a list containing the value `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`.**
