You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.

This time Miroslav laid out $n$ skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number $i$, it leads to turning $k$ closest skewers from each side of the skewer $i$, that is, skewers number $i - k$, $i - k + 1$, ..., $i - 1$, $i + 1$, ..., $i + k - 1$, $i + k$ (if they exist). 

For example, let $n = 6$ and $k = 1$. When Miroslav turns skewer number $3$, then skewers with numbers $2$, $3$, and $4$ will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number $1$, then skewers number $1$, $3$, and $4$ will be turned over, while skewer number $2$ will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).

As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all $n$ skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example $n = 6$ and $k = 1$, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number $2$ and $5$.

Help Miroslav turn over all $n$ skewers.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $0 \leq k \leq 1000$) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.


-----Output-----

The first line should contain integer $l$ — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all $n$ skewers. After than print $l$ integers from $1$ to $n$ denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 2

Output
2
1 6 

Input
5 1

Output
2
1 4 



-----Note-----

In the first example the first operation turns over skewers $1$, $2$ and $3$, the second operation turns over skewers $4$, $5$, $6$ and $7$.

In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers $2$ and $5$, but turning skewers $2$ and $4$, or $1$ and $5$ are incorrect solutions because the skewer $3$ is in the initial state after these operations.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    l = (n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)
    res = []
    for i in range(l):
        res.append(i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1)
    print(l)
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of actions `l` and the skewers to be turned over is flawed.

To see why, consider the following example:

### Example:
- Input:
  ```
  5 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  1 4
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  2
  1 6
  ```

In this example, the program outputs `6`, which is out of bounds since the maximum index is `5`. Additionally, turning skewers `1` and `6` is incorrect because skewer `6` does not exist.

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Actions (`l`)**:
   - The formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` does not correctly determine the minimum number of actions required. This formula assumes a uniform distribution of actions, which is not always accurate.

2. **Incorrect Selection of Skewers**:
   - The program incorrectly selects skewers based on the calculated indices, leading to out-of-bound errors and incorrect skewers being turned.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the problem correctly in at least one case, hence the correctness is `False`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from the standard input, where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\). It calculates the largest integer \(l\) such that \(n > (k + 1) \cdot l\), and then generates a list of integers starting from 1 up to \(n\) in steps of \(k + 1\). Finally, it prints the value of \(l\) followed by the list of integers. If \(n \leq k + 1\), the list generated will be empty. If \(n\) is exactly divisible by \(k + 1\), the last number in the list will be equal to \(n\). If \(n\) is not exactly divisible, the last number in the list will be less than \(n\).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
