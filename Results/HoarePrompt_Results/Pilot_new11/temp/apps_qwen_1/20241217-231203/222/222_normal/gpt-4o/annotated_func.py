#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000.
def func_1(n, k):
    positions = []
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        positions.append(i)
        
        i += 2 * k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `positions` is a list containing all odd numbers starting from 1 up to the largest odd number less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and 1000; `i` is greater than `n`.
    print(len(positions))
    print(' '.join(map(str, positions)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\). After executing the function, it prints the length of the `positions` list, which contains all odd numbers starting from 1 up to the largest odd number less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and 1000. Additionally, it prints the elements of the `positions` list separated by spaces.
