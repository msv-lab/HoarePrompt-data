Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The code calculates the number of operations needed to turn over all skewers and generates a list of starting skewers for each operation, but it does not actually simulate the process of turning over the skewers according to the specified rules. Specifically, the code assumes that turning over a skewer at position \(i\) will turn over all skewers within \(k\) positions on either side, but it does not properly simulate this behavior.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- Input: \(n = 7\), \(k = 2\)

According to the problem description, turning over skewer number 3 would turn over skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. However, the code would only turn over skewers 1 and 6, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the code does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over in the minimum number of steps. For instance, for \(n = 7\) and \(k = 2\), the correct solution would be to turn over skewers 1 and 6, as demonstrated in the example output. But the code does not produce this result.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
