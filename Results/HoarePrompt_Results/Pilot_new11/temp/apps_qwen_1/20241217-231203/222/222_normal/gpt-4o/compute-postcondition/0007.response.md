`i` is incremented by the value of `2 * k + 1`. The initial condition that `n` is greater than or equal to `5 + 2 * k` remains unchanged. The `positions` list still contains `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `5 + 2 * k`; `positions` contains `i`; `i` is increased by `2 * k + 1`**
