The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `positions`. Initially, `i` is 1, so the list `positions` is updated to contain the integer 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `positions` is `[1]`; `i` is 2**
