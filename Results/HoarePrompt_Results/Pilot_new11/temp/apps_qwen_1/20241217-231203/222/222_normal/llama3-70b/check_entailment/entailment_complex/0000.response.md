Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program generates a sequence of skewers to be turned over based on the formula \(i \times (k * 2 + 1) + 1\), which does not align with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Description Analysis:
- The problem requires turning over all \(n\) skewers using the minimal number of actions.
- Each action turns \(k+1\) skewers centered around a specific skewer \(i\).
- The goal is to cover all skewers \(1\) to \(n\) with the minimum number of such actions.

### Program Analysis:
- The variable `l` is calculated as \((n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\), which seems to be an attempt to find how many actions are needed.
- The list `res` is constructed using the formula \(i \times (k * 2 + 1) + 1\), which suggests turning every \(k+1\)th skewer starting from the first skewer.
- This approach does not guarantee that all skewers will be turned over, especially for cases where the number of skewers is not a multiple of \(k+1\).

### Example Counter-Example:
Consider \(n = 7\) and \(k = 2\):
- According to the problem, the optimal solution should involve two actions:
  1. Turn skewers 1, 2, and 3.
  2. Turn skewers 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- However, the program would generate skewers to turn as follows:
  - First action: Turn skewers 1, 3, 5, 7.
  - Second action: Turn skewers 2, 4, 6.
- This results in skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 being turned, but the actions are not optimal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of actions needed to turn all skewers. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
