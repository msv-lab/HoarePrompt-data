The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\).

The function returns either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a space-separated list of integers contained in the variable 'bits'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and return 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a space-separated list of integers contained in the variable 'bits'.
