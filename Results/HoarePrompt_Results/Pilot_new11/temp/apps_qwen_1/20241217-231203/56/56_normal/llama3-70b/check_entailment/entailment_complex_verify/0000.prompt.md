You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the correct output according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the required sequence length `k` is greater than the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`.

Consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 17`, `k = 4`
- Binary representation of 17 is `10001`, which has two bits set to 1.
- The program should output a sequence of four numbers that sum up to 17 and have the smallest maximum value, and among those, the lexicographically largest one.
- A valid sequence could be `[4, 3, 1, 0]` because \(2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 27\), but we need to adjust this to sum exactly to 17. One valid sequence is `[4, 3, 1, -1]` since \(2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^{-1} = 16 + 8 + 2 + 0.5 = 26.5\), and by adjusting further, we get `[4, 3, 1, -2]` which sums to 17.

However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly. It will only append bits from the binary representation of `n` until the length of `a` is less than `k`, which might result in a sequence that does not meet the lexicographical criteria or the exact sum requirement.

Here’s a specific counterexample:
- Input: `n = 17`, `k = 4`
- Expected Output: `Yes 4 3 1 -2`
- Actual Output: The program might output something incorrect or fail to output the correct sequence.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output, leading to a verdict of `False`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('No')
    else :
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            
            if x <= i:
                break
            
            a.append(x)
            
            n -= 2 ** x
            
            i += 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the bit lengths of the powers of 2 subtracted from the original `n` during each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations (which is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n` minus 1), `x` is the last bit length appended to `a`.
        if (len(a) < k) :
            print('No')
        else :
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the bit lengths of the powers of 2 subtracted from the original `n` during each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations (which is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n` minus 1), `x` is the last bit length appended to `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, the function continues with the current `a`. Otherwise, `a` is truncated to the first `k` elements and `i` is set to -1.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{5}\). If `n` is less than `k`, then 'No' is printed to the console. Otherwise, `n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the bit lengths of the powers of 2 subtracted from the original `n` during each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations (which is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n` minus 1), and `x` is the last bit length appended to `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, the function continues with the current `a`. Otherwise, `a` is truncated to the first `k` elements and `i` is set to -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers \(n\) and \(k\), where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{5}\). It determines whether it is possible to construct a sequence of exactly \(k\) distinct integers, each being a power of 2, whose sum equals \(n\). If such a sequence exists, the function prints 'Yes' followed by the sequence of integers. If not, it prints 'No'. Specifically:

1. The function first checks if \(n\) is less than \(k\). If true, it prints 'No' immediately.
2. Otherwise, it constructs a list `a` containing the bit lengths of the powers of 2 subtracted from \(n\) until \(n\) becomes 0.
3. If the length of `a` is less than \(k\), it prints 'No'.
4. If the length of `a` is at least \(k\), it truncates `a` to its first \(k\) elements and sorts these elements in descending order before printing 'Yes' followed by the sorted list of integers.
