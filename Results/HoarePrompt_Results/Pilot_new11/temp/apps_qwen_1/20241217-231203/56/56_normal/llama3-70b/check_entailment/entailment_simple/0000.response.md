Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the output sequence is the lexicographically largest among all valid sequences with the minimum maximum element. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling the Case When the Length of the Sequence is Less Than k:**
   - The program checks if the length of the list `a` (which contains the bit lengths of the powers of 2 subtracted from `n`) is less than `k`. If it is, it prints "No" directly. However, this check alone is insufficient. According to the problem, even if the length of `a` is less than `k`, the program should try to construct a sequence of length `k` by adding zeros at the end to meet the length requirement. The sequence should still be constructed in a way that the maximum element is minimized and the resulting sequence is lexicographically largest.

2. **Ensuring Lexicographically Largest Sequence:**
   - After truncating `a` to the first `k` elements, the program sorts `a` in reverse order (to get the lexicographically largest sequence). However, this sorting step is necessary only if the length of `a` is exactly `k`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, the program should append zeros until the length of `a` is `k` and then sort. But the program does not handle this correctly.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Construct the initial list of exponents
    a = []
    i = 0
    while n > 0:
        x = n.bit_length() - 1
        if x <= i:
            break
        a.append(x)
        n -= 2 ** x
        i += 1
    
    # Ensure the length of a is at least k
    if len(a) < k:
        a.extend([0] * (k - len(a)))
    
    # Sort the list to make it lexicographically largest
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    
    if n != 0:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
        print(' '.join(map(str, a)))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Construct the Initial List of Exponents:** The initial list `a` is constructed by finding the highest bit in `n` and subtracting the corresponding power of 2 until `n` becomes 0.
2. **Ensure the Length of `a` is at Least `k`:** If the length of `a` is less than `k`, append zeros to `a` until its length reaches `k`.
3. **Sort the List to Make It Lexicographically Largest:** Sort `a` in reverse order to ensure it is the lexicographically largest sequence.
4. **Check if `n` is Zero:** If `n` is not zero, it means the constructed sequence cannot meet the exact sum requirement, so print "No".
5. **Print the Result:** Print "Yes" followed by the constructed sequence.

By ensuring these steps, the program correctly meets the problem requirements.
