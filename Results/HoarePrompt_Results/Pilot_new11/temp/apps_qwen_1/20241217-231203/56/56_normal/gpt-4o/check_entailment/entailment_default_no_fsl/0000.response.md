Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the binary representation of `n` has fewer set bits than `k`. Specifically, the code fails to produce the lexicographically largest sequence when the number of set bits in `n` is less than `k`.

### Example where the program fails:
Consider the input `n = 1` and `k = 3`.

- The binary representation of `n = 1` is `1`.
- There is only one bit set to 1, so `bits` will contain `[0]`.
- Since the length of `bits` (which is 1) is less than `k` (which is 3), the loop appends `-1` twice to `bits`.
- After sorting in reverse order, `bits` becomes `[0, -1, -1]`.

However, the lexicographically largest sequence should be `[-1, -1, -1]` because it has the smallest maximum value among all possible sequences with the same sum of powers of 2.

The correct output for this case should be:
```
Yes
-1 -1 -1
```

But the current implementation outputs:
```
No
```

This indicates that the code incorrectly returns 'No' instead of attempting to generate a valid sequence. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
