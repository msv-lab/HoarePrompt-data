To ensure that the loop `while len(bits) < k:` executes at least once, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `len(bits) < k` becomes true.

Let's break down the given conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\).
- `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`.
- The length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`.

The loop `while len(bits) < k:` will continue until the length of `bits` is no longer less than `k`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the length of `bits` must be less than `k` right before the loop starts. Since `bits` is initially less than or equal to `k`, the only way to ensure the loop executes at least once is to make sure that the length of `bits` is less than `k`.

Therefore, the current state is already sufficient to allow the loop to execute at least once, as `len(bits)` is guaranteed to be less than `k` based on the problem constraints.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k`**
