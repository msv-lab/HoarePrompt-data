Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program does not handle cases where the required sequence includes negative exponents, which is a critical requirement according to the problem description. For example, for the input `1 2`, the correct output should be `Yes -1 -1` because \(2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\). However, the current implementation only considers non-negative exponents and thus would incorrectly output `No` for this case. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description.
