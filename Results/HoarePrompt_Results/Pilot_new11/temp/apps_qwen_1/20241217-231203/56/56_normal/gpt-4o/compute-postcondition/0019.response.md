The code `smallest = bits.pop()` removes the last element from the `bits` list and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` and `k`. The value of `bits` is updated by removing its last element.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\), `smallest` is the last element of `bits` before popping, `bits` is a list containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` with the last element removed and the length of `bits` is less than or equal to `k-1`.**
