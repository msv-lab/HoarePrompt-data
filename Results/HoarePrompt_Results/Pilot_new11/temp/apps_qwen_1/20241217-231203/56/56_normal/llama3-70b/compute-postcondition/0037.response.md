Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{5}\). If `n` is less than `k`, then 'No' is printed to the console. Otherwise, `n` is 0, `a` is a list containing the bit lengths of the powers of 2 subtracted from the original `n` during each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations (which is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n` minus 1), and `x` is the last bit length appended to `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, the function continues with the current `a`. Otherwise, `a` is truncated to the first `k` elements and `i` is set to -1.***
