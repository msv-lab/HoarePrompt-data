The code `print('No')` prints the string 'No' to the console. However, this does not change the values of the variables `n` and `k`. The condition that `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) and `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{5}\) with `n` being less than `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\); `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{5}\); `n` is less than `k`; 'No' is printed to the console.**
