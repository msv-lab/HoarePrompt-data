Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It initializes the number of stones to 0 and updates this count based on the operations specified in the input string. The code ensures that the number of stones does not drop below zero by using the `max(0, stones - 1)` expression when an operation is "-". This handles all potential cases as described:

- If the first operation is "+", the initial count of stones is set to 1.
- If the first operation is "-", the initial count of stones is set to 0, which is valid since the pile is non-empty before the operation.
- The code correctly processes all subsequent operations, ensuring the count never goes below zero.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code appears to handle all scenarios appropriately.
