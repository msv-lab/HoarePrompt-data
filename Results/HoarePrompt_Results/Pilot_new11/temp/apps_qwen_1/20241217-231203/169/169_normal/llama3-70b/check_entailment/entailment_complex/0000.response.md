Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of operations and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" characters.
2. **Counting Operations**: It counts the number of "-" and "+" characters in the string `s` using the `count` method. These counts are stored in `minus_count` and `plus_count` respectively.
3. **Logic Implementation**: 
   - If the count of "-" characters (`minus_count`) is greater than the count of "+" characters (`plus_count`), the program prints `0`. This is because if there are more removals than additions, the pile will eventually become empty.
   - Otherwise, it prints the difference `plus_count - minus_count`, which represents the minimal possible number of stones left in the pile after performing all the operations.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly determines the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations. The logic aligns perfectly with the problem statement and examples provided, ensuring the program meets the requirements for all valid inputs.
