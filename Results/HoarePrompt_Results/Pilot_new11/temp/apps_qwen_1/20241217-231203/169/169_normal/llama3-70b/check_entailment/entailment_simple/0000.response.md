Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the first line to get the integer \( n \), which represents the number of operations.
   - It then reads the second line to get the string \( s \) containing the operations (either `'-'` or `'+').

2. **Counting Operations**:
   - The program counts the number of removal operations (`'-'`) and addition operations (`'+'`) using the `count()` method. This is stored in `minus_count` and `plus_count`, respectively.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The program calculates the minimal possible number of stones remaining in the pile after all operations.
   - If the number of removal operations (`minus_count`) is greater than the number of addition operations (`plus_count`), the pile would have run out of stones, and the result would be `0`.
   - Otherwise, the result is the difference between the number of addition operations and the number of removal operations (`plus_count - minus_count`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated result, which is the minimal possible number of stones in the pile.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- **Logic Alignment**: The logic in the program aligns perfectly with the problem statement. It ensures that the pile remains non-empty until a removal operation is performed, which matches the requirement that the pile should never be empty before a removal operation.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If there are more removal operations than addition operations, the pile will be empty, and the program correctly outputs `0`.
  - If the number of addition operations is greater than or equal to the number of removal operations, the minimal possible number of stones is calculated as the difference between additions and removals.
- **Input Validity Assumption**: Although the problem states that the input will be valid, the program itself does not explicitly handle invalid inputs like negative integers or non-string inputs. However, since the problem assumes valid input, the program adheres to the problem constraints.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all valid cases.
