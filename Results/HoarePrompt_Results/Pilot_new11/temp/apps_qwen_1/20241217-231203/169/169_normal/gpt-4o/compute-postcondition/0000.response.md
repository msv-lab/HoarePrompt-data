The code reads an integer `n` from the first line of input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means `n` is now set to the value of the integer input. The string `s` remains unaffected as it is read in a subsequent line.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of operations. The second line contains a string s of length n, where each character is either "-" (indicating removing a stone) or "+", `n` is the integer input from the first line.**
