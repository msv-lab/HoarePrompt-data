Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is an integer.
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+".
- `stones` is 1.
- If the operation is '+', `stones` is incremented by 1.
- If the operation is '-', `stones` remains unchanged and is still 0.

### Loop Statement
```
for operation in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- The variable `operation` takes on each character from `s` one by one.
- Depending on the value of `operation`, `stones` is updated as follows:
  - If `operation` is '+', `stones` is incremented by 1.
  - If `operation` is '-', `stones` remains unchanged and stays at 1 (since it starts at 1 and never gets decremented).

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- Since `stones` is always 1 and never changes once the loop starts, we only need to consider how many iterations have occurred and which character `operation` was.

### Determining the Next Iteration
- Since `stones` is always 1, the loop will continue to execute until all characters in `s` have been processed.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `operation` was one of the characters in `s`.

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` must be the next operation.
- Since `s` is a non-empty string of length `n`, there will be `n` total iterations.
- If the loop has just completed its \( k \)-th iteration, the next character in `s` will be the \((k+1)\)-th character.

### Final Answer
- At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the loop has just processed the \( k \)-th character. Therefore, for the next iteration, `operation` will be the \((k+1)\)-th character in `s`.
- Since `stones` remains 1 regardless of the operation, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the current `operation`.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string, the next state should reflect that the loop will process the next character in `s`.

**State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+", `stones` is 1, and the next `operation` is the next character in `s`.**
