Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of `n` characters either "-" or "+", and `stones` is 0. If the operation is '-', the operation is set to '-'. There is no change in `n` and `s` since the else part is not provided and the operation is already set to '-' in the if part.***
