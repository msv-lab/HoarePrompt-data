Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the string of operations, adjusting the count of stones appropriately. For each "+", it increments the stone count, and for each "-", it decrements the stone count but ensures it doesn't go below zero. Given the constraints and the nature of the operations, the program will always produce the minimal possible number of stones that can be left in the pile after performing the operations. Since no edge cases were found where the program fails to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
