The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input stream, where the first line contains a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of operations, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, where each character is either "-" (indicating removing a stone) or "+" (indicating adding a stone). The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input string to count the number of "+" and "-" characters.

Functionality: **The function accepts input consisting of two lines: the first line is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of operations, and the second line is a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "-" and "+". The function counts the number of "+" and "-" characters in the string `s`.**
