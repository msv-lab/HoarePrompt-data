Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of two lines: the first line is a positive integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) representing the number of operations, and the second line is a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing characters "-" and "+". The function counts the number of "+" and "-" characters in the string \( s \). It then compares the count of "-" characters to the count of "+" characters. If the count of "-" characters is greater than the count of "+" characters, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the count of "+" characters and the count of "-" characters. This difference represents the net number of "+" characters in the string after considering the removals indicated by "-".**

Edge Cases:
- If the string \( s \) is empty, the function should handle this case appropriately, though the given code assumes \( n \geq 1 \). To cover this, we could add a check at the beginning of the function.
- If the string \( s \) contains characters other than "-" and "+", the function should handle this case by ignoring or raising an error. The given code assumes only "-" and "+" characters, so no additional handling is required in the current code.

Missing Functionality:
- There is no functionality to handle the case where the string \( s \) is empty. The code implicitly assumes \( n \geq 1 \), so to fully cover all edge cases, an initial check for an empty string would be necessary. For example:
  ```python
  if n == 0:
      print(0)
      return
  ```
