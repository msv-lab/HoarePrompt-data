Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. The logic counts the number of operations that add a stone (`+`) and subtracts the number of operations that take away a stone (`-`). If the number of `-` operations is greater than the number of `+` operations, the minimal number of stones in the pile would be `0`. Otherwise, it returns the difference, which represents the minimum number of stones remaining after the operations.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all possible cases correctly. There is no scenario provided or imaginable where the program fails to meet the requirements described in the problem statement.
