Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\), `a` is a non-empty list representing a valid path in the matrix, `px` is the last `nx` calculated, `py` is the last `ny` calculated, and for every element `v` in `a`, the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop checks if each step in the path represented by the list `a` is a valid move on the matrix. A valid move means that the Manhattan distance (sum of the absolute differences in the row and column indices) between the current position `(px, py)` and the next position `(nx, ny)` is exactly 1.
- After the loop completes, the final values of `px` and `py` will be the coordinates of the last cell visited in the path. Therefore, `px` and `py` will be the last `nx` and `ny` calculated, respectively.
- For the loop to execute `n` times, the list `a` must represent a valid path, meaning each move in the path is adjacent (either horizontally or vertically) to the previous cell in the path.
- If the loop does not execute at all, it implies that the list `a` is empty, but since the problem statement mentions "some number of times," we assume the list is non-empty and the loop does execute at least once.
