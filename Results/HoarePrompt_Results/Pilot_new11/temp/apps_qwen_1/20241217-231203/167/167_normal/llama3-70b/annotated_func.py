#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9. The matrix A is defined such that A[i][j] = y*(i-1) + j for every \(i \in [1..x]\) and \(j \in [1..y]\), and the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents a valid path in this matrix where each a_i is an integer between 1 and xy inclusive.
def func_1(x, y):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        
        px, py = nx, ny
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\), `a` is a non-empty list representing a valid path in the matrix, `px` is the last `nx` calculated, `py` is the last `ny` calculated, and for every element `v` in `a`, the absolute difference between `nx` and `px` plus the absolute difference between `ny` and `py` is equal to 1.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the dimensions of a matrix. It also takes a list `a` representing a path through this matrix. The function checks whether the path represented by `a` is valid, meaning each step in the path moves to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) in the matrix. If the path is valid, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases include:
1. The list `a` might be empty, in which case the function should return `False` since no path can be formed.
2. The values in `a` must be within the range `[1, xy]`, where `xy` is the total number of cells in the matrix (`x * y`). If any value in `a` is out of this range, the function should return `False`.

Missing functionality in the current code:
1. The function should handle the case where `a` is an empty list, which is currently not covered by the existing code.
