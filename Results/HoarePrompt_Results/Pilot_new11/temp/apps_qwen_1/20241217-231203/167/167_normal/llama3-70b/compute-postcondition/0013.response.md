Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list with at least one element, `v_new` is the next element in the list `a`, `nx` is \(\frac{v_new - 1}{y}\), `ny` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\), `px` is \(\frac{v_new - 1}{y}\), `py` is \((v_new - 1) \% y\)**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on `v_new`, `y`. Specifically, `nx` is set to \((v_new - 1) // y\) and `ny` is set to \((v_new - 1) \% y\). Since `px` and `py` are defined to be equal to `nx` and `ny` respectively, they also get updated accordingly. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `a`, `v_new`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
