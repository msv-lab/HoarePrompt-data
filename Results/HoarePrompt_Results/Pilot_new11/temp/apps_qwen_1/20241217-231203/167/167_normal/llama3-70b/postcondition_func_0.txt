The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the dimensions of a matrix. It also takes a list `a` representing a path through this matrix. The function checks whether the path represented by `a` is valid, meaning each step in the path moves to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) in the matrix. If the path is valid, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Potential edge cases include:
1. The list `a` might be empty, in which case the function should return `False` since no path can be formed.
2. The values in `a` must be within the range `[1, xy]`, where `xy` is the total number of cells in the matrix (`x * y`). If any value in `a` is out of this range, the function should return `False`.

Missing functionality in the current code:
1. The function should handle the case where `a` is an empty list, which is currently not covered by the existing code.
