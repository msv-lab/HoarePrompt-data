Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle negative angles correctly. Specifically, for a negative angle like `-60`, the program calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns incorrectly.

For `-60` degrees:
- The normalized angle is `-60 % 360 = 300` degrees (clockwise).
- The program calculates `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 60 // 90 % 4 = 0 % 4 = 0`.

However, the correct number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical is `3` (as per the example output).

To fix this, the program should handle negative angles properly. One way to do this is by converting negative angles to positive equivalents before performing calculations:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = (x + 360) % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)
```

This corrected version ensures that negative angles are handled correctly, aligning with the problem description for all potential cases.
