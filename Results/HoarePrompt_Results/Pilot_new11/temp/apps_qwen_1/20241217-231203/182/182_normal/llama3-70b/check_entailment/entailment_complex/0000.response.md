Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Normalization of Input Angle**: 
   - The program takes an integer input `x` representing the camera angle in degrees.
   - It normalizes `x` using the modulo operation (`x = x % 360`). This ensures that the angle `x` is within the range \([-359, 359]\) degrees, which is a critical step as the camera can rotate more than \(360^\circ\).

2. **Handling Zero Angle**:
   - If `x` is exactly `0`, the program directly prints `0`. This correctly handles the scenario where no rotation is needed.

3. **Determining Minimum Number of Turns**:
   - For non-zero angles, the program computes the minimum number of \(90^\circ\) clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from the vertical.
   - It does this by calculating `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4`. This formula effectively finds the closest multiple of \(90^\circ\) that brings the angle as close as possible to a multiple of \(360^\circ\).
     - Adding `90` shifts the angle to a range where modulo operations can easily determine the closest quarter-turn.
     - Subtracting `1` ensures that the result is rounded towards the smaller angle.
     - Dividing by `90` and taking modulo `4` normalizes the result to one of `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`, corresponding to the number of \(90^\circ\) clockwise turns needed.

By following these steps, the program correctly determines the minimum number of \(90^\circ\) clockwise turns required to align the image as closely as possible with the vertical direction, adhering to the constraints of the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
