The code prints the value of `turns`. The value of `turns` is determined by the value of `normalized_angle`, which is `x % 360`. After printing `turns`, the value of `turns` remains unchanged, but `x` and `normalized_angle` are no longer accessible since they are used only within the scope before the print statement. The output of the print statement is the value of `turns`, which depends on the value of `normalized_angle`.

Output State: **`turns` is printed; `normalized_angle` is `x % 360`; `x` is replaced by its value modulo 360**
