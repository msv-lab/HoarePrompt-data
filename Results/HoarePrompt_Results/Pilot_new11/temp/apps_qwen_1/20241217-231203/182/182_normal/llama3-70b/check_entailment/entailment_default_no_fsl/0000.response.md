Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. The code normalizes the input angle `x` to the range of -359 to 359 degrees and then calculates the result based on a specific formula, which does not always yield the correct number of turns.

For example, consider the input `-60` degrees. According to the problem description, the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise, which means the image is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. The correct number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical is 3 (since 60 degrees clockwise is equivalent to 300 degrees clockwise, and three 90-degree turns will bring it to 330 degrees clockwise, which is closest to 360 degrees or 0 degrees).

However, the code calculates `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` for `x = -60`. Let's break it down:

1. `x = -60`
2. `x % 360 = -60` (since -60 is already within the range -359 to 359)
3. `(-60 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4 = 29 // 90 % 4 = 0`

The code incorrectly outputs `0`, which means it thinks no turns are needed. This is not the correct answer as the minimum number of 90-degree turns needed is 3.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
