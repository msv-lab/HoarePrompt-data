Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly normalizes the angle `x` using `x % 360` to ensure it falls within the range of -359 to 359 degrees. This handling covers both positive and negative angles effectively.

The logic in the if-else block `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` is sound and correctly determines the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical. The annotations clarify that this approach accounts for all possible deviations by adjusting the angle and finding the closest quarter of 90 degrees.

Given the examples and the detailed explanation in the annotations, the program meets the problem requirements and is correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of **True** is appropriate.
