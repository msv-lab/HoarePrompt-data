Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for both positive and negative angles. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Handling Positive and Negative Angles**: The program first normalizes the angle `x` using `x % 360`, which handles both positive (clockwise) and negative (counter-clockwise) rotations.
   
2. **Finding Minimum Deviation**: The formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` ensures that the angle is adjusted to the closest 90-degree interval. This works by adding 90 degrees (to handle cases where the angle is close to a multiple of 90) and then taking modulo 4 to find the closest quarter of 90 degrees. This approach accounts for all possible deviations and finds the minimum number of 90-degree turns required.

Given the examples provided and the general logic, the program handles all cases correctly. For instance:
- For `x = 60` (or -300), the result is `1`.
- For `x = -60` (or 300), the result is `3`.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the given problem description.
