Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for both positive and negative angles. The output hints confirm that the program normalizes the angle using modulo 360 and then adjusts it to find the closest 90-degree interval by adding 90 degrees and taking modulo 90 followed by modulo 4. This approach ensures that the program handles all cases correctly, as demonstrated by the examples provided. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints.
