Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical direction. The logic in the program is flawed because it calculates the `normalized_angle` as `x % 360`, which gives the equivalent angle within the range of 0 to 360 degrees, but it does not consider the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) of the rotation.

Let's analyze the given program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   ```python
   x = int(input())
   ```
   This part is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Normalized Angle Calculation**:
   ```python
   normalized_angle = x % 360
   ```
   This correctly normalizes the angle to the range 0 to 360 degrees, but it does not account for whether the angle is positive (clockwise) or negative (counter-clockwise).

3. **Turns Calculation**:
   ```python
   turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
   ```
   This logic attempts to calculate the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed. However, it does not handle the direction of the rotation properly. For example, if `x = 60` (clockwise rotation), the normalized angle is `60`, and the turns calculation gives `3`. But the correct answer should be `1` because rotating `60` degrees clockwise by `90` degrees results in a smaller deviation than rotating `300` degrees clockwise.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider both the magnitude and direction of the rotation angle. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    # Normalize the angle to the range [0, 360)
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    # Determine the direction and calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns
    if normalized_angle <= 180:
        turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90
    else:
        turns = (720 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: Same as before.
2. **Normalized Angle Calculation**: Same as before.
3. **Direction and Turns Calculation**:
   - If the normalized angle is less than or equal to 180 degrees, it means the rotation is either directly clockwise or counter-clockwise without needing more than one 90-degree turn.
   - If the normalized angle is greater than 180 degrees, we need to adjust the angle to find the minimum deviation by considering the equivalent angle in the opposite direction (i.e., subtracting the angle from 360 degrees twice to bring it back to the first quadrant).

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical direction.
