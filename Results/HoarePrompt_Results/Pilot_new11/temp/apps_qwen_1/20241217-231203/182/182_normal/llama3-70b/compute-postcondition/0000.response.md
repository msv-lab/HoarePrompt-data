`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial value of `x` was an integer such that \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\). After running the code, the value of `x` will now be the integer input provided by the user, and this new value will be within the same range.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, such that \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\)**
