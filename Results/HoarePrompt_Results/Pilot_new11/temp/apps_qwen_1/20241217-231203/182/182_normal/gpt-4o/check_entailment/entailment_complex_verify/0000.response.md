Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The program correctly normalizes the angle to a range between 0 and 360 degrees using `x % 360`. For both positive and negative input angles, the program calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. The expression `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` ensures that the minimum number of turns is found while adhering to the constraint of rotating only 90 degrees at a time. The annotated version confirms that the program handles the normalization and calculation logic correctly, supporting the original assessment of correctness.
