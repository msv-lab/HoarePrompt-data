The code `final_y += 1` increments the value of `final_y` by 1. Since `final_y` was not previously initialized in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `final_y` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `operations` is a string consisting of at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are integers such that \(-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\); `final_y` is 1**
