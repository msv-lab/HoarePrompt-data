Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the output hints, the function `func_1` now correctly handles the case where the initial sequence of operations already reaches the target coordinates, returning `0` in such scenarios. Additionally, it correctly tracks and updates the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to move the robot to the target coordinates. The potential edge case where the target position cannot be reached is also appropriately handled by returning `-1`. Therefore, the program now meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.
