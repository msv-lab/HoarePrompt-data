`current_x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_x` was 1 (based on the initial state where `current_x` is determined based on `operations[1]`). Therefore, the new value of `current_x` is 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` is 2, `current_y` is determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is unchanged, `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1)`**
