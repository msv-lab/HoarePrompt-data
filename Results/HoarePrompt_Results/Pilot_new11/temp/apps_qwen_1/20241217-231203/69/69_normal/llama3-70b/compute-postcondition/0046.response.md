`dy` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `dy` is `y - uy`, and since `dy` is greater than 0, after decrementing by 1, the new value of `dy` will be `(y - uy) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` must be a non-empty string, `ux` is the final value of horizontal movement (sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements), `uy` is the final value of vertical movement (sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements), `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `(y - uy) - 1`, `res` is 0, and the current operation `op` is 'U'.**
