`res` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`ops`, `op`, `dx`, `dy`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `ops` must be a non-empty string, `op` is the current operation being processed, `dx` is the updated value of horizontal movement, `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement, and `res` is 1.

Output State: **`ops` must be a non-empty string, `op` is the current operation being processed, `dx` is the updated value of horizontal movement, `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement, and `res` is 1**
