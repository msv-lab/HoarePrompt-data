The code `final_y = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `final_y`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, or `final_x`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of n characters each being 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and `x`, `y` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; `final_x` is 0; `final_y` is 0.**
