`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds an integer input from the user. The sequence and variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, the sequence is a string of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and x, y are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.**
