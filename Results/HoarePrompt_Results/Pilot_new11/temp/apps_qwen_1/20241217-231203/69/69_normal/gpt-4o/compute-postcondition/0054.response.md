`current_x` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, and `operations[i]` is 'L'. The state of these variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `current_x` is its initial value minus 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `operations[i]` is 'L', `current_x` is `-1`.**
