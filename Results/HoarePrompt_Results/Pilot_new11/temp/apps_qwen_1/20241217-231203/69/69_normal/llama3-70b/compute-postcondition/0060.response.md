Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` must be a non-empty string, `ux` is the final value of horizontal movement (sum of all 'R' and 'L' movements), `uy` is the final value of vertical movement (sum of all 'U' and 'D' movements), `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 0. If the current operation `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is updated to 0. Otherwise, if the current operation `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux - 1`. For any other case, `res` is set to 1, `dx` remains unchanged, and `dy` remains unchanged. If the current operation `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is updated to `x - ux + 1`.***
