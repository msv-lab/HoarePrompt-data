The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`ops`, `op`, `dx`, `dy`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the next operation in the string, `dx` is the updated value of horizontal movement (less than or equal to 0 if 'R', otherwise unchanged), `dy` is the updated value of vertical movement (less than or equal to 0 if 'U', otherwise unchanged), and `res` is 1.
