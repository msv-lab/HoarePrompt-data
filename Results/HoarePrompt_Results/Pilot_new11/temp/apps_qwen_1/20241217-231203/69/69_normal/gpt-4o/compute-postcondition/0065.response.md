Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `current_x` is determined based on `operations[0]`, `current_y` is determined based on `operations[0]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`). If `target_pos` is present in `position_map`, then `min_length` is updated to `i - position_map[target_pos]` (a negative number). If `target_pos` is not in `position_map`, no changes are made to `min_length`.**
