Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user, `sequence` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are integers input from the user, `ops` is a string that must have at least one character, `ux` and `uy` are integers, if `op` is 'R', then `ux` is 1 and `uy` is 0. If `op` is 'L', then `ux` is -1 and `uy` remains 0. Otherwise, the values of `ux` and `uy` remain unchanged as 0.***
