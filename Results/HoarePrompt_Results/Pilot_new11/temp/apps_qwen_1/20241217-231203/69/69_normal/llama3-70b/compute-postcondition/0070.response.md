Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is the current operation being processed. If `op` is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, then `dy` is incremented by 1. If `op` is 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is decremented by 1. If `op` is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, then `dx` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` is set to 1. The values of `dy` and `res` reflect the outcomes of the respective conditions.***
