Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `current_x` and `current_y` are determined based on `operations[1]`, `target_pos` is (`current_x` + `dx`, `current_y` + `dy`), `min_length` is either unchanged or updated to the minimum of its current value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`, and `position_map` contains the key-value pair `((current_x, current_y), 1).`***
