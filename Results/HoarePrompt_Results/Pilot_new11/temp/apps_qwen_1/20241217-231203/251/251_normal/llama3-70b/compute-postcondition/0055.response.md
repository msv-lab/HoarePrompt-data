The code `print(dp[-1])` prints the last element of the `dp` list, which is `dp[n-1]`. This does not change any values in the `dp`, `cakes`, or `n` variables. The only effect is that the last element of `dp` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each `dp[i]` is the maximum volume of a cake that can be added to the previous cake without violating the height and radius constraints, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, and the value of `dp[-1]` (or `dp[n-1]`) is printed.**
