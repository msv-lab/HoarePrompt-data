Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is equal to `n`.
  - `dp[i]` is the maximum value between `volumes[i]` and `volumes[0] + volumes[i]`.
  - `n` remains the same.
  - `j` is 0.
- The loop statement is:
  ```python
  for j in range(i):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(i)` will execute as long as `j < i`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i = n`
   - `j = 0`
3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the first iteration, `j` will go from 0 to `i-1`, which is `n-1`.
   - After the loop, `j` will be `n`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`i`**: Since the loop runs until `j < i`, `i` remains unchanged at the start of the loop. Therefore, `i` is still `n`.
- **`j`**: The loop increments `j` starting from 0 up to `i-1`. After the loop, `j` will be `n`.
- **`dp[i]`**: This value does not change during the loop execution because the loop only iterates over `j` and does not directly affect `dp[i]`.
- **`n`**: This value remains unchanged as per the given information.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n`.
- `dp[i]` remains the same (maximum value between `volumes[i]` and `volumes[0] + volumes[i]`).
- `n` remains the same.

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value between `volumes[i]` and `volumes[0] + volumes[i]`, `n` remains the same.**
