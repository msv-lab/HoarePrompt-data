Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the radius and height of a cake. It processes this list to calculate the maximum volume of a subset of cakes that can be stacked together without violating the height and radius constraints. Specifically, it ensures that no two adjacent cakes in the stack have the same or larger radius and height. The function sorts the cakes by their volume in descending order and then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum volume that can be achieved under these constraints. Finally, it prints the maximum volume that can be obtained. If the input list is empty or any tuple does not contain exactly two positive integers, the function raises an error.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input list is empty, the function should raise an error, but the current code does not handle this case explicitly. It implicitly handles this case through the sorting and dynamic programming steps, which would fail if `n` is zero.
- The function does not provide an explicit error message for invalid inputs (tuples with less than two elements). Instead, it relies on the sorting and dynamic programming steps to fail, which might not be intuitive for users.
