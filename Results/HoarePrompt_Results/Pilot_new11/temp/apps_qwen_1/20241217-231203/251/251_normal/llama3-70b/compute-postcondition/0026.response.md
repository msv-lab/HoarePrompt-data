Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, `dp[2]` is equal to `cakes[2][0]`, and `dp[3]` is the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[j] + cakes[3][0]` for `j` in [0, 1, 2] if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]` holds true for some `j` in [0, 1, 2]. Otherwise, `dp[3]` remains unchanged.***
