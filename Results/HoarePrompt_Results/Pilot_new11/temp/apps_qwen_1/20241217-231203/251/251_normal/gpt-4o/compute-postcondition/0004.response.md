The code `print(f'{result:.6f}')` prints the value of `result` formatted to 6 decimal places. This does not change the value of `result` or any other variables; it only outputs the value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the value of `result` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively, and each tuple is formed by converting `int(data[2 * i + 1])` and `int(data[2 * i + 2])` into integers for i in range(n), `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`, and the value of `result` is printed formatted to 6 decimal places.**
