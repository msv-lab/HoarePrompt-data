The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n` and `j` is `n-1`, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `dp[i]` is `max(dp[i], dp[n-1] + volumes[n])`**
