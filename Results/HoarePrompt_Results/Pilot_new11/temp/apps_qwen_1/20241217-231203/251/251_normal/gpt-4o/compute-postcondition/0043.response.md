The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, and `cakes`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 <= r_i, h_i <= 10000. After executing the function body, the program returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the maximum value of `volumes[i]` plus the maximum sum of subproblems from indices 0 to i-2 for each i from 0 to n-1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples `cakes`, and return the maximum value in the list `dp` as described. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` (a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000) and a parameter `cakes` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 <= r_i, h_i <= 10000). It returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the maximum value of `volumes[i]` plus the maximum sum of subproblems from indices 0 to i-2 for each i from 0 to n-1.**
