Postcondition: ***`i` is at least 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by volume, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + cakes[i][0]` where `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` holds true. `dp[0]` is equal to `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` is equal to `cakes[1][0]`, and the rest of the elements in `dp` follow the updated rule.***

This postcondition consolidates both the if and else parts. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the changes and conditions specified in the if part.
