Postcondition: **`dp[k+1]` is updated to `max(cakes[k+1][0], dp[j] + cakes[k+1][0])`, `i` is `k + 1`, and the condition `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` must be satisfied. Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains as the postcondition of the if part.**
