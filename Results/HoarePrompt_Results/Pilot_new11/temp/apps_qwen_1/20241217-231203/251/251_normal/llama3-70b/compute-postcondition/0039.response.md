Postcondition: ***`dp[k+1]` is an integer. If there exists a `j` such that `j < k+1` and `cakes[k+1][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[k+1][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[k+1]` is updated to `max(dp[k+1], dp[j] + cakes[k+1][0])`. Otherwise, `dp[k+1]` remains unchanged. Additionally, `cakes[k+1][1] < cakes[k][1]` and `cakes[k+1][2] < cakes[k][2]` hold true.***

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the if-else block, ensuring that the postcondition reflects the updates made within the if condition and maintains the original constraints and states as specified in the precondition.
