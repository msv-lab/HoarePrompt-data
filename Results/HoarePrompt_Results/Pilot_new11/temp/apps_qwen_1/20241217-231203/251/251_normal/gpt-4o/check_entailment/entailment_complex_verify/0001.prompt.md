You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import sys
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution to find the maximum possible total volume of the special cake. The `func_1` function calculates the maximum volume that can be achieved by considering each cake and checking if it can be placed on top of any previous cake with a smaller volume. The `func_2` function reads the input and calls `func_1` to compute the result.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the implementation seems to handle all cases correctly. Here’s a brief verification:

1. **Volume Calculation**: The volume calculation for each cake using the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \) is correct.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The dynamic programming approach ensures that the cake with the largest volume is placed on top of the cake with the next largest volume, and so on, which is in line with the problem requirements.
3. **Input Parsing**: The input parsing logic in `func_2` correctly extracts the radius and height for each cake.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as per the examples, the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 <= r_i, h_i <= 10000.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `j` is `0`, `dp` is a list of length `n` where each element `dp[i]` is the maximum value of `volumes[i]` plus the maximum sum of subproblems from indices `0` to `i-2`, `n` remains the same, and `volumes` is a list of volumes calculated as \(\pi \times r_i \times r_i \times h_i\) for each cake \((r_i, h_i)\) in `cakes`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list dp, which represents the maximum value of volumes[i] plus the maximum sum of subproblems from indices 0 to i-2 for each i from 0 to n-1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) and `cakes` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10000). It calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi \times r_i \times r_i \times h_i \) and stores these volumes in a list called `volumes`. Then, it uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum value of `volumes[i]` plus the maximum sum of subproblems from indices 0 to i-2 for each i from 0 to n-1. This is stored in a list called `dp`. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the optimal way to select cakes to maximize the sum of their volumes considering the subproblem constraints.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 000, and cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively, with 1 <= radius_i, height_i <= 10 000.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, processes it to extract the number of cakes and their respective radii and heights, and then calls another function `func_1` with these values. It finally prints the result returned by `func_1`, formatted to six decimal places. The input consists of the integer `n` followed by `2n` integers representing the radii and heights of the cakes. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 100,000, the function will still read and process the input, but this case is not handled within the function itself. Additionally, if the radii or heights of the cakes are outside the range 1 to 10,000, no specific handling is provided for such cases.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
