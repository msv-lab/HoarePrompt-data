Let's break down the given information and the requirements of the for loop:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `j` is `n-2`
   - `dp[n]` remains unchanged
   - `n` remains the same
   - `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`

2. **For Loop:**
   ```
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop `for j in range(i)` will execute as long as `j < i`.
   - For this loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 because the range function in Python includes all integers from 0 up to but not including the upper bound. Therefore, if `i` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, the key condition here is that `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - `i` should be adjusted to be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Remaining States:**
   - `j` is `n-2` which is valid as long as `n > 2` (though `n > 0` already ensures `n-2` is non-negative).
   - `dp[n]` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]` which is valid as long as `i` (which is `n`) is within the bounds of the `dp` array.

Given these points, the states that need adjustment are:

State: **`i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-2`, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`**
