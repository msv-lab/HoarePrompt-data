According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because the `range(n)` function will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `n-1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

The initial state provided is:
- `n` is the integer entered by the user
- `cakes` is an empty list

Since the loop requires `n` to be greater than 0, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement. The value of `cakes` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop but should be noted as part of the initial state.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cakes` is an empty list**
