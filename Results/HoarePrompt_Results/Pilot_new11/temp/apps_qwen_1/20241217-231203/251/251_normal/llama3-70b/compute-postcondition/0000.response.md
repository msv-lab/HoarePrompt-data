`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This means that `n` now holds the number of tuples representing the radii and heights of cakes. The list of tuples is not directly modified by this line of code, so it remains unchanged in terms of its content.

Output State: **The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake, and the length of this list is a positive integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100 000; `n` is the integer entered by the user.**
