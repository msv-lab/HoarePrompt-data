Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `dp[0]` is equal to `max(volumes[0], dp[1] + volumes[0])`
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\)
   - `j` is 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(i)`, which means it iterates from `0` to `i-1`. Since `i` is 0 initially, the loop condition `j in range(i)` will never be true because `range(0)` is an empty range.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the initial conditions and the condition `if volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, we can infer that if `j` were to enter the loop, the value of `dp[0]` would remain unchanged.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is 0, `range(i)` is an empty range, meaning the loop will not execute at all.
   - There are no changes to `dp[0]`, `n`, or `j` as the loop does not run.

Therefore, the states do not change at the start of the next iteration because the loop does not execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `dp[0]` is equal to `max(volumes[0], dp[1] + volumes[0])`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), and `j` is 1**
