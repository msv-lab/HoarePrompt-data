`in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1. The value of `in_degree[neighbor]` can be -1 or 0, so after decrementing by 1, it can become -2 (if it was -1) or -1 (if it was 0). The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is -2 or -1, `queue` contains the remaining elements after processing the current `node`, and `node` is the next node from `queue`**
