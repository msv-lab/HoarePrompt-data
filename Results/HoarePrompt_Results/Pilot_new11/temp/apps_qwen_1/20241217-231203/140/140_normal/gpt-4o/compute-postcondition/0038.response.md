The code `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` to the right end of the queue. This operation does not affect the value of `in_degree`, the previous value of `count`, the previously removed node from `queue`, or the value of `in_degree[neighbor]`.

Therefore, the updated state includes the addition of `neighbor` to the queue.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph, `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 and the additional element `neighbor`, `count` is `count + 2`, `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.**
