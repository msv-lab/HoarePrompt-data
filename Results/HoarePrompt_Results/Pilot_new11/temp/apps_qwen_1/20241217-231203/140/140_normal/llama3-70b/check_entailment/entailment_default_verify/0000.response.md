Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not attempt to remove any edge before checking for cycles. The `func_1` function performs a DFS to detect cycles but does not consider removing any edge. According to the problem description, we need to check if the graph becomes acyclic by removing at most one edge. The current implementation fails to address this requirement, hence it cannot be considered correct.
