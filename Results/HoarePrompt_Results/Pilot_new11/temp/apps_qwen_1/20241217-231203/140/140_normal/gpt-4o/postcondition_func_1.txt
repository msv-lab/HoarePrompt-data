The function `has_cycle` accepts a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are integers (vertices) and values are lists of integers (outgoing edges). It also implicitly accepts `n` and `m`, where `n` is the total number of nodes and `m` is the total number of edges in the graph. The function determines whether the graph contains a cycle by performing a topological sort using Kahn's algorithm (a breadth-first search approach based on in-degrees).

After processing, the function returns `True` if the graph contains a cycle (i.e., `count != n`), and `False` otherwise. Here, `count` represents the number of nodes processed during the algorithm.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the graph is empty (`graph` is an empty dictionary), the function should return `False` since no nodes can form a cycle.
2. If the graph has less than 2 nodes (i.e., `n < 2`), the function should return `False` as cycles require at least two nodes.
3. The current implementation assumes the graph is a directed graph without self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, which might not always be the case in practical scenarios. However, the function does not explicitly handle these cases, and the behavior for such graphs would need to be clarified.
