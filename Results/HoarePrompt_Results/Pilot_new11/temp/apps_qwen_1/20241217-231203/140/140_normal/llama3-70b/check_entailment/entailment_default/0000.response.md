Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to detect cycles in a directed graph using Depth-First Search (DFS) with recursion. However, the program does not actually check if removing at most one edge can make the graph acyclic. Instead, it simply checks for the presence of any cycle in the graph. Hereâ€™s why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The function `func_1` detects cycles but does not attempt to remove any edges to check if the graph becomes acyclic. It only confirms the existence of a cycle.

2. **Potential Case**: Consider a graph with the following edges:
   ```
   3 4
   1 2
   2 3
   3 2
   3 1
   ```

   Running the current code will correctly identify a cycle involving nodes 2, 3, and 1. However, this code does not check if removing any single edge would make the graph acyclic. To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to try removing each edge and check if the resulting graph is acyclic.

3. **Missing Logic**: The program should iterate through each edge, temporarily remove it, and then check if the graph becomes acyclic. If any such removal makes the graph acyclic, the program should return "YES". Otherwise, it should return "NO".

Since the provided code does not implement the necessary logic to check the removal of edges, it cannot meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
