Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` is -2 or -1, `queue` contains the remaining elements after processing the current `node` plus `neighbor`, and `node` is the next node from `queue`. If `in_degree[neighbor]` becomes 0, this transition is included in the queue. Otherwise, the original state is maintained.***
