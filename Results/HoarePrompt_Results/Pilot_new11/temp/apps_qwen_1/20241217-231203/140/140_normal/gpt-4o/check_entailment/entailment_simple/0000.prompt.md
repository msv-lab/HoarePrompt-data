You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), m is an integer representing the number of edges (1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)), and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v).
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `edges` is a list of tuples, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, `graph` is a `defaultdict(list)` where for each key `u`, `graph[u]` includes all `v` as elements for each tuple `(u, v)` in `edges`.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `edges` is a list of tuples, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, `graph` is a `defaultdict(list)` where for each key `u`, `graph[u]` includes all `v` as elements for each tuple `(u, v)` in `edges`. The graph contains at least one cycle
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a `defaultdict(list)` where for each key `u`, `graph[u]` includes all `v` such that `(u, v)` was originally in `edges` and the graph still contains at least one cycle after removing and re-adding each edge `(u, v)` exactly once.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices (1 to n) and values are lists of integers representing outgoing edges from each vertex. n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000).
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `graph` must have at least one key for the loop to execute at least once; if the loop does not execute, `in_degree` remains unchanged.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `in_degree` is a dictionary where the in-degree of each node is updated to reflect the remaining incoming edges after processing, `queue` is empty, `count` is the total number of nodes processed, `node` is undefined.
    return count != n
    #The program returns count != n, where count is the total number of nodes processed and n is the total number of nodes in the graph


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
