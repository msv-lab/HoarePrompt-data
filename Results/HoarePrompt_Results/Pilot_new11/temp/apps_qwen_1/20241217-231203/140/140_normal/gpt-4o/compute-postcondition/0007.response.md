`in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The value of `v` is not specified in the initial state but is known to be an integer from 1 to `n`. The `graph` dictionary remains unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n` and each value is 0 except `in_degree[v]` which is 3, `graph` must have `u` as a key and `graph[u]` must have at least one element**
