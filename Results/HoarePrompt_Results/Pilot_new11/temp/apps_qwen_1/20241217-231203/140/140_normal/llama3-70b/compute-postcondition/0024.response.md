Output State: **`node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a list (possibly empty), `visited` is a set containing all vertices that can be reached from `node` through a series of edges, `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`. If any `neighbor` in `graph[node]` has already been visited and is also in `rec_stack`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False` if no such `neighbor` exists and the loop completes without returning.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to iterate over all neighbors of `node` in the `graph` until there are no more neighbors left to check.
- Each neighbor is checked to see if it has already been visited (`neighbor` in `visited`) and whether it is present in the `rec_stack` (`rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`).
- If any such neighbor is found, the function returns `True` immediately.
- If the loop completes without finding any such neighbor, the function returns `False`.

This final state reflects the behavior of the loop after all possible iterations have taken place, considering the conditions under which the function might return `True` or `False`.
