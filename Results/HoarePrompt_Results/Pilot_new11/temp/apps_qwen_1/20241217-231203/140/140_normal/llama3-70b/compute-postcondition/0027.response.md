The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. 

- `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex points to.
- `visited` is a set of integers representing vertices that have been visited during the recursion.
- `rec_stack` is a set of integers representing vertices in the current recursion stack.

The function has multiple return points:
- Case_1 to Case_6: The program returns True.
- Case_7: The program returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `node`, a graph represented as a dictionary, a set of visited vertices, and a set of vertices in the current recursion stack, and it returns True in multiple cases and False in one case.
