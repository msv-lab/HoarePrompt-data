Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `graph` must have at least one key for the loop to execute at least once; if the loop does not execute, `in_degree` remains unchanged.**
