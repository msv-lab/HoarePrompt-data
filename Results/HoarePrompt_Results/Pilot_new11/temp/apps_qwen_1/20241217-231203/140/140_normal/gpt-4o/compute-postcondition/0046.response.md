The code removes the first element from the `queue` using `popleft()`. This operation changes the state of the `queue` but does not affect the `in_degree` dictionary. 

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the updated number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` does not contain the node that was removed (the first element of `queue`).**
