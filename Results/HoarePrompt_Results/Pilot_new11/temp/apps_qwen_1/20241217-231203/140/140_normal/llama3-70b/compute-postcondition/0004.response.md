Postcondition: **`node` is an integer existing as a key in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `visited` is a set including `node`, `rec_stack` is a set where `rec_stack[node]` is `True`, the current value of `neighbor` has not been visited (`neighbor` is not in `visited`). The function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `True`**
