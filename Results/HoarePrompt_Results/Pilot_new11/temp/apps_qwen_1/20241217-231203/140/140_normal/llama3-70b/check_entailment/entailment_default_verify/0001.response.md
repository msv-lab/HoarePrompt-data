Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program uses DFS to detect cycles in a directed graph but does not account for the requirement to check if the graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. The function `func_1` correctly identifies cycles, but it does not attempt to simulate the removal of any edges or check if the graph becomes acyclic after such removals. The program needs to iterate through each edge, temporarily remove it, and then check if the graph becomes acyclic. The current implementation does not perform these additional steps, leading to an incomplete solution.
