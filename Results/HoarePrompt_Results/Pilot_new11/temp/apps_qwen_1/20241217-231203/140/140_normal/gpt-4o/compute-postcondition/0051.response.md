`neighbor` is appended to the `queue`. The `in_degree` of `neighbor` remains 0 because the code only appends to the queue without changing the `in_degree`. The `count` is increased by 1, and `graph[node]` still contains at least one neighbor. The state of `queue` changes to include the newly added `neighbor`.

Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, `queue` contains the node `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, and `graph[node]` contains at least one neighbor.**
