The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The value of `count` was initially `count + 1`, so now it becomes `count + 2`. The values of `in_degree`, `queue`, and `node` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 (but one node has been removed); `count` is `count + 2`; `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`.**
