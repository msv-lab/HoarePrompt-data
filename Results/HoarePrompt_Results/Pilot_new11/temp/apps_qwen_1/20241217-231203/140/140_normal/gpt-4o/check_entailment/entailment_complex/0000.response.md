Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the graph is empty or has fewer than 2 nodes, which is a potential edge case. According to the problem description, the graph must have at least 2 vertices. The function `has_cycle` does not account for this scenario, and if the graph is empty or has only one vertex, the program will incorrectly return `False` for both cases. 

For example, if the input is:
```
1 0
```
The graph is empty, and the program should return `True` because no edges exist to form a cycle. However, the current implementation will return `False`.

Additionally, the annotation mentions that the function should return `False` if the graph has less than 2 nodes, which is another valid point that the current implementation does not cover. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
