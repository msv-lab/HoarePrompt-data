Postcondition: **`in_degree` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `n`, and for every vertex `v` in the graph, the value of `in_degree[v]` is the total number of edges directed into `v` from all other vertices in the graph; `queue` is a deque containing nodes with an in-degree of 0 (excluding the node `node` that was just removed from the left end); `count` is `count + 2`; `node` is the node that was removed from the left end of `queue`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, resulting in `in_degree[neighbor]` being equal to 0.**
