`node` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue` using `popleft()`, which removes and returns that element from `queue`. The `count` variable is incremented by 1 since a node has been processed. The initial state where all nodes in `in_degree` have an in-degree of 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **all nodes in `in_degree` have an in-degree of 0; `queue` contains at least one less node; `node` is the first node from `queue`; `count` is the number of nodes processed plus 1.**
