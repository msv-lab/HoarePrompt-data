Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases correctly based on the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input values correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and splits them into integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\).

2. **Minimum Coins Calculation**: The calculation for `min_x` is done correctly:
   \[
   \text{min\_x} = \left\lceil \frac{L + M - 1}{M} \right\rceil
   \]
   This ensures that the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to satisfy the condition that at least \(L\) coins must be new.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition check `if M * min_x <= N - K:` ensures that the total number of unique coins gifted can be accommodated within the available \(N\) types of coins, after accounting for the \(K\) coins Ivan already has.

4. **Output Handling**: If the condition is satisfied, the program prints the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift (`min_x`). Otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
