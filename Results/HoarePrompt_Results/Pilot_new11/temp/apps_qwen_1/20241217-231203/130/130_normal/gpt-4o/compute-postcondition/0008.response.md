The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to check the given constraints and return based on the conditions provided. Specifically, the function checks if the integers `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` satisfy the following constraints: 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18, and M * (N - K) ≥ L.
