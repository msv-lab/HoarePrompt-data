The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. Since the input values are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values, but we know they follow the given constraints. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **$N$, $M$, $K$, and $L$ are integers such that $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$, $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$, and $M \times \text{minimum number of coins each friend can gift} \ge L$; `N` is set to the first input integer, `M` is set to the second input integer, `K` is set to the third input integer, and `L` is set to the fourth input integer.**
