Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the requirement that all coins given to Ivan must be different. 

Consider the following case:
- Input: `10 15 2 5`

In this case:
- \( N = 10 \) (total different coins)
- \( M = 15 \) (number of friends)
- \( K = 2 \) (coins Ivan already has)
- \( L = 5 \) (new coins required)

According to the problem, all friends must give different coins, and since \( M = 15 \), it means there should be 15 different coins given. However, there are only 10 different coins available, so it is impossible to give 15 different coins. Therefore, the output should be `-1`.

However, the current implementation checks only if \( M \geq N - K + 1 \) and \( M \geq L \). It does not ensure that all coins given are different. Thus, it will incorrectly output `1` in this case, indicating that it is possible to give 15 different coins, which is not feasible given the constraints.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the requirement that all coins given to Ivan must be different.
