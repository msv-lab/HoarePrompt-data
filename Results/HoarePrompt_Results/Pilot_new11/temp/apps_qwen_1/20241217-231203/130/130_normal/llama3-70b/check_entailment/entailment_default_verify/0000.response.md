Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions based on the problem description. The program checks two key conditions:
1. \(M \ge N - K + 1\) to ensure there are enough different coins to gift such that at least \(L\) of them are new.
2. \(M \ge L\) to ensure that the total number of friends can gift enough coins to meet the new coin requirement.

The output hints confirm that the program operates as expected, checking these conditions and printing `1` if both are met, otherwise `-1`. The program does not require additional handling for edge cases beyond the constraints provided, and the logic aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
