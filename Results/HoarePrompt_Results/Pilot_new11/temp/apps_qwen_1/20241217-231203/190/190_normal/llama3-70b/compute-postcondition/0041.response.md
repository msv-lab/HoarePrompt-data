To determine the final output state of the given loop, let's break down the loop logic and the changes it makes to the variables involved.

### Initial State
- `mid` is an integer.
- `cost` is initially undefined.
- `min_cost` is initially undefined.
- `min_t` is initially undefined.
- `sticks` is a list of integers.

### Loop Logic
The loop iterates over `i` starting from `mid + 1` up to `100` (inclusive).

For each iteration:
- `cost` is calculated as the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element `x` in `sticks` and `i` and `i-1`.
- If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, and `min_t` is set to the current value of `i`.

### Analysis of Iterations
Let's analyze the loop based on the provided output states for the first few iterations:

#### After 1 iteration
- `i` is `mid + 1`.
- `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences for `sticks` with respect to `i` and `i-1`.
- If `cost < min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `mid + 1`.
- If `cost >= min_cost`, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.

#### After 2 iterations
- `i` is `mid + 2`.
- `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences for `sticks` with respect to `i` and `i-1`.
- If `cost < min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `mid + 2`.
- If `cost >= min_cost`, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.

#### After 3 iterations
- `i` is `mid + 3`.
- `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences for `sticks` with respect to `i` and `i-1`.
- If `cost < min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `mid + 3`.
- If `cost >= min_cost`, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.

From these patterns, we can infer that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `100`, or until `min_cost` cannot be further improved by any subsequent iteration.

### Final Output State
- The loop will eventually execute for all `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`.
- `min_cost` will hold the minimum value of `cost` encountered during the loop.
- `min_t` will hold the value of `i` corresponding to the minimum `cost`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

**Output State: `i` is `100`, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences for `sticks` with respect to `i` and `i-1`, `min_cost` is the minimum value of `cost` encountered during the loop, and `min_t` is the value of `i` corresponding to `min_cost`.**

Note: If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `mid + 1` is greater than or equal to `100`), then `min_cost` and `min_t` will remain their initial undefined states.
