The code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` updates the value of `current_cost` by adding the difference between the length of the list `a` and `t + 1` to `current_cost`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is 2
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and each element is between 1 and 100
- `current_cost` is 0
- `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`
- `best_t` is 1
- the length of the list `a` is greater than `t + 1`

Let's denote the length of the list `a` as `length`. Since `length > t + 1` and `t` is 2, `length > 3`. Therefore, the value added to `current_cost` is `length - 3`.

Since `current_cost` was initially 0, after the addition, `current_cost` becomes `length - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and each element is between 1 and 100, `current_cost` is `length - 3`, `min_cost` is 0, `best_t` is 1, the length of the list `a` is greater than `t + 1`**
