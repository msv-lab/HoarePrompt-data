`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `i` remains `mid + 2`, and the value of `cost` remains the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`. The initial value of `min_cost` is no longer relevant since it has been updated.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`, `min_cost` is `cost`**
