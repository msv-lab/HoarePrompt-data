Postcondition: ***`t` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length `n` that must contain at least one element, `current_cost` is `n - 4`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is 2, and the length of the list `a` is greater than or equal to 2. If the length of the list `a` is greater than 4, the length of the list `a` is adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
