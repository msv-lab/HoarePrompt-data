Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 2, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is 0, and `best_t` is 1. This is because the condition `length > t + 1` is false, and there is no else part to consider, so the postcondition remains as the initial postcondition of the if part.***
