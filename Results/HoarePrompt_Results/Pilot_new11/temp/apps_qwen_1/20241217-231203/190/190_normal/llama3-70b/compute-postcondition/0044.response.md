Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts no parameters directly but relies on input from the user. It processes a list of integers `sticks` and determines the integer `t` that minimizes the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and either `t` or `t+1`. The function sorts the list `sticks` and initializes `t` and `min_cost` with the median of `sticks`. It then iterates from `mid - 1` down to `1` and from `mid + 1` up to `100`, updating `min_cost` and `min_t` if a lower cost is found. After the loops, the function prints the value of `min_t` and `min_cost`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If the input list `sticks` has fewer than 2 elements, the function will raise an error because the median calculation (`mid = sticks[n // 2]`) will be invalid.
- If the input list `sticks` is empty, the function will also raise an error due to the same reason as above.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where the input list `sticks` contains duplicate values. The median calculation and subsequent operations assume unique values in `sticks`.
