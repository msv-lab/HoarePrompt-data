Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list `sticks` contains duplicate values. The median calculation assumes that the list has unique values, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. This can lead to incorrect results if there are duplicates in the input list. For example, consider the input:

```
3
3 3 3
```

The correct output should be `3 0` because all sticks are already almost good for \( t = 3 \). However, the current implementation will fail to handle this case correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
