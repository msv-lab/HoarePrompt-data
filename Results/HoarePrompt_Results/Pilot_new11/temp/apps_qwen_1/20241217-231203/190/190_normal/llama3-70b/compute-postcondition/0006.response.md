The code assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. This does not change the values of any other variables and only updates `min_cost` to be equal to `cost`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `sticks` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100; `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`; `cost` is the sum of abs(x - mid) for each x in `sticks`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
