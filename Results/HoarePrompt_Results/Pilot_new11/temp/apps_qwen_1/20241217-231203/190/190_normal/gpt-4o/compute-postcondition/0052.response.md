The code `best_t = t` assigns the value of `t` (which is 2) to the variable `best_t`. Since `t` is 2, `best_t` will also be 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, each element is between 1 and 100, `current_cost` is the sum of increments based on the loop conditions and is currently less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is 2.**
