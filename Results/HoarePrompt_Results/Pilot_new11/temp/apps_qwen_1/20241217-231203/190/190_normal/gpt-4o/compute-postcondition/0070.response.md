`current_cost` is updated by adding the value of `t - 1 - length`. Given the initial state, `t` is 4, so the expression `t - 1` equals `3`. The variable `length` is the length of the list `a`, which is 4. Therefore, `t - 1 - length` equals `3 - 4`, which is `-1`. Thus, `current_cost` is increased by `-1`, meaning `current_cost` is decreased by `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers with length 4, `current_cost` is decreased by 1, `min_cost` remains unchanged, and `best_t` remains 2.**
