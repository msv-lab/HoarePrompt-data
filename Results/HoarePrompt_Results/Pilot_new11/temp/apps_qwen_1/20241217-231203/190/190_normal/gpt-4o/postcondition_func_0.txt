The function accepts an integer \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 100 \). It then iterates over possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100, calculating a cost for each \( t \) based on the differences between \( t \) and the elements in \( a \). The cost is defined such that if an element \( a_i \) is less than \( t - 1 \), the cost is increased by \( t - 1 - a_i \), and if \( a_i \) is greater than \( t + 1 \), the cost is increased by \( a_i - (t + 1) \). After evaluating all possible \( t \), the function identifies the value of \( t \) that results in the minimum cost and prints this value along with the corresponding minimum cost. If there are multiple values of \( t \) that result in the same minimum cost, the function will still identify one of them.
