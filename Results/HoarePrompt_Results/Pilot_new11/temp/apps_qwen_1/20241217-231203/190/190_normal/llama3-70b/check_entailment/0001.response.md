Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only considers changing the sticks to the nearest values around the median without considering the possibility of choosing a different \( t \) that could potentially result in a lower cost.

Let's consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
3
1 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1 0
```

Explanation: All sticks are already almost good for \( t = 1 \), so no changes are needed, and the cost should be 0.

However, the program outputs:
```
1 1
```

This is incorrect because the program calculates the cost based on the median value, which in this case is 1. It computes the cost as follows:
- Changing 1 to 1 has a cost of 0.
- Changing 1 to 1 has a cost of 0.
- Changing 2 to 1 has a cost of 1.

Thus, the total cost is 1, which is higher than the expected cost of 0.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
