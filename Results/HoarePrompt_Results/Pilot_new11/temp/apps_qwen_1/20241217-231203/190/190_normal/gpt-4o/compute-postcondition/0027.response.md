The variable `best_t` is assigned the value of `t`. Since `t` was initially 1, `best_t` is now 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `current_cost`, and `min_cost` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `current_cost` is the sum of \((length - 2)\) for all `length` in `a` that are greater than 2, and `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`; `best_t` is 1.**
