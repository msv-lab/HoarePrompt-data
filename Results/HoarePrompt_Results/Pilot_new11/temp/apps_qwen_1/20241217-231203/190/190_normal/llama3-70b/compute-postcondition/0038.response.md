The code assigns the value of the variable `cost` to `min_cost`. This means that the value of `min_cost` is updated to be the same as the current value of `cost`. The other variables, `i` and `sticks`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `mid + 3`, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`, `min_cost` is the same as the current value of `cost`.**
