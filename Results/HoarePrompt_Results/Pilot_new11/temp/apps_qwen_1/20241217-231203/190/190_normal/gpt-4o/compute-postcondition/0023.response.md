Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 and the length of `a` is equal to \(n - 2\); `current_cost` is updated as follows: if `length` (the length of `a`) is less than `t - 1`, then `current_cost` is `current_cost` + (-n + 2). Otherwise, `current_cost` is `current_cost` + (`length` - 2).***
