Postcondition: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is an integer such that `mid + 1` is less than 101, `cost` is the sum of minimum absolute differences calculated from the list `sticks` for each element `x` with respect to `i` and `i-1`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost` and `min_t` is set to `mid + 1`.**
