Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the array can have gaps that are more than 1 but still allow for consecutive elements to be erased without breaking the increasing order property. For example, consider the input:

```
Input:
5
1 3 6 9 12
```

In this case, JATC can erase the second, third, and fourth elements, leaving the array `[1, \_, \_, \_, 12]`. This means the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased is `3`, but the program only calculates the difference between consecutive elements and prints the maximum difference minus one, which would be `2` in this case. Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased in all cases.
