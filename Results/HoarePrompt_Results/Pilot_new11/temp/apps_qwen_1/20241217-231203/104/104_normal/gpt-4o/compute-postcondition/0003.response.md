Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop is iterating over `range(1, n)`, which means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `max_erase` is 0, but this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition.

3. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute even once, we need to ensure `n > 1`.
   - Additionally, `i` will be set to 1 at the beginning of the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1**
