According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is either `initial_j + 1` or the same as `initial_j`, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and `initial_j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The condition `i < n` must still hold true. Since `n` must be greater than 0, we don't need to change the condition for `n`. However, `j` can remain the same or increase based on the previous iteration's value.

Given that `j` is either `initial_j + 1` or the same as `initial_j`, and since `i` is now 1, `j` will start from `initial_j + 1` in the next iteration. Also, `max_erase` remains unchanged because the loop body (which is omitted) does not modify it unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is either `initial_j + 1` or the same as `initial_j` (since the exact value isn't specified, we can keep it as is)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `max_erase` remains the maximum of its original value and `initial_j`

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is either `initial_j + 1` or the same as `initial_j`, `max_erase` is the maximum of its original value and `initial_j`**
