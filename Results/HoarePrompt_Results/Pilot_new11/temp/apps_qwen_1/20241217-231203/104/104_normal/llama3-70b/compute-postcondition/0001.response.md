The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. The variable `n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100. After executing this line of code, `n` remains unchanged, and the new list `a` is created based on the user input.

Let's denote the user input as a sequence of space-separated integers. For example, if the user inputs "5 10 15", then `a` would be `[5, 10, 15]`.

Since the exact input is not specified, we can represent the output state in a general form:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100; `a` is a list of integers created from the user input**
