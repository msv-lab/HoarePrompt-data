Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Processing**: 
   - The program reads the integer `n` which represents the number of elements in the array.
   - It then reads the array `a` consisting of `n` integers.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum Erasable Elements**:
   - The program uses a nested loop to check all possible subarrays of the array.
   - For each subarray defined by indices `i` and `j`, it checks if the condition `all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))` holds true. This condition ensures that the subarray maintains the strictly increasing property with the correct index differences.
   - If the condition holds, it calculates the length of the subarray (`j - i`) and subtracts 1 to get the number of elements that can be erased.
   - The maximum value of these calculated values is stored in `max_erase`.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the maximum number of elements that can be erased.

The program correctly follows the problem constraints:
- It ensures that the array remains strictly increasing after erasing the elements.
- It handles all cases where the subarray maintains the required properties.
- It correctly calculates and outputs the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased.

Thus, the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem statement, making it correct.
