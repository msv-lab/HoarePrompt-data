To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the provided information and the structure of the for loop.

Given:
- `n` is an integer input from the user within the range 1 to 100.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the user input.
- `max_erase` is 0 (this variable is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
- `i` is 0.

The for loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. The loop should start with the value of `j` being greater than `i`.
2. The loop should continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `i` is initially 0, the loop will start with `j` being 1 (since `range(i + 1, n + 1)` translates to `range(1, n + 1)` when `i` is 0). Therefore, the loop will execute if `j` ranges from 1 to `n`.

Since `n` is a user input within the range 1 to 100, the loop can only execute if `n` is at least 1.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
