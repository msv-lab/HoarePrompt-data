The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, based on the constraints provided, it implies that the function might internally use variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` with specific constraints: 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5). The output provided does not specify a direct return value but rather conditions based on these parameters.

Given the information, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but uses internal variables n, m, r, and k with specified constraints and returns a value based on these variables.**
