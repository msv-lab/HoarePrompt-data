Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. Specifically, the `coverage` function calculates the number of cells in the rectangle `(x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1)` that are within the bounds of the pond. However, the logic in the `coverage` function has several issues:

1. The calculation of the minimum and maximum values to determine the number of cells covered by the scoop-net is incorrect. It should consider the boundaries of the pond more accurately.
2. The `coverage` function should correctly handle the edges of the pond, but the current implementation does not account for these boundary conditions properly.

To fix this, the `coverage` function needs to correctly calculate the number of cells covered by the scoop-net considering the boundaries of the pond. Here is a corrected version of the `coverage` function:

```python
def coverage(x, y):
    cover_x = max(0, x - r + 1) + min(n - r + 1, x + 1) - max(0, x - r + 1)
    cover_y = max(0, y - r + 1) + min(m - r + 1, y + 1) - max(0, y - r + 1)
    return cover_x * cover_y
```

With this corrected `coverage` function, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
