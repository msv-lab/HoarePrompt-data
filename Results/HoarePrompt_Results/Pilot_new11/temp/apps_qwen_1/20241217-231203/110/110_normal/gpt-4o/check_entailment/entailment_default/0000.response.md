Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the expected number of caught fishes. The issue lies in how the `coverage` function is implemented and how the `func_1` function processes the coverage values. 

The `coverage` function calculates the number of cells that can be covered by the scoop-net, but it does not consider the fact that the scoop-net should lie completely within the pond. The function should ensure that the coverage is calculated within the valid bounds of the pond. Additionally, the `func_1` function aims to maximize the expected number of caught fishes by placing `k` fishes in such a way that the average number of caught fishes is maximized. However, the current implementation does not correctly account for the optimal placement of fishes to achieve this goal.

A correct approach would involve identifying the most strategically placed cells for the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is placed randomly. The current implementation does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results.
