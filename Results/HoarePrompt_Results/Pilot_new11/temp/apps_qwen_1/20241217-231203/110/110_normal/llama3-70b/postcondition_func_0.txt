The function reads four integers \(n\), \(m\), \(r\), and \(k\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\), \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), and \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n \times m, 10^5)\). It calculates the minimum of \(k\) and the product of \((n - r + 1)\) and \((m - r + 1)\), then prints the ratio of this minimum value to the product \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\). This ratio represents the fraction of the area of a submatrix of size \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\) out of the total possible submatrices. The function does not handle any input validation and assumes the input adheres to the given constraints. If the input does not meet these constraints, the behavior is undefined.
