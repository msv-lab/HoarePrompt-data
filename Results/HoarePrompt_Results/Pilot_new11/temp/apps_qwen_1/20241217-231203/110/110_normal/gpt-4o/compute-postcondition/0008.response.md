Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `r` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), `k` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n * m, 10^5), `heap` contains tuples `(-coverage(i, j), i, j)` for all `i` in range(n) and `j` in range(m), and `y` is equal to `m-1`.**
