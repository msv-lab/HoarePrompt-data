Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. According to the problem description, the goal is to place \(k\) fishes in such a way that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized when the scoop-net is placed randomly. The current program does not address this objective; instead, it calculates a simple ratio based on the dimensions of the pond and the scoop-net, which is not related to maximizing the expected number of caught fishes.

To maximize the expected number of caught fishes, we should strategically place the fishes in a way that maximizes the overlap with the possible positions of the scoop-net. A correct approach would involve placing the fishes in the central region of the pond to ensure that no matter where the scoop-net is placed, there is a high probability of catching many fishes. However, the current program does not implement this strategy and simply calculates a fixed value without considering the placement of fishes.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
