    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `r` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `r` ≤ min(`n`, `m`), `k` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n * m`, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing tuples (`-coverage(i, j)`, `i`, `j`) for all `i` in range(`n`) and `j` in range(`m`), and `x` is `n-1`

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_coverage` is `0 - k * cov`, `_` is a positive integer less than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `cov` is the smallest element popped from the heap during each iteration, `x` is the second smallest element popped from the heap during each iteration, `y` is the third smallest element popped from the heap during each iteration.

    #`The program returns (0 - k * cov) / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k`, representing dimensions of a grid, the radius of coverage for scoops, and the number of scoops, respectively. It returns the average reduction in coverage due to the placement of `k` scoops on the grid, normalized by the total number of possible positions for scoops not intersecting within the radius `r`. Specifically, it constructs a priority queue of all possible scoop positions based on their coverage, pops the `k` positions with the smallest coverage, subtracts their combined coverage from the total, and then normalizes this reduction by the total number of valid scoop positions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the coordinates of a cell in the pond where a fish is placed, n and m are the dimensions of the pond (with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5), and r is the size of the scoop-net (with 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)).
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r +
    1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
    #(min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 2, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 2, 0))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `coverage` calculates the number of cells in a pond that can be covered by a scoop-net of size `r` when placed at coordinates `(x, y)`. Given the dimensions of the pond `n` and `m`, the function returns the product of the number of cells that can be covered horizontally and vertically from the point `(x, y)` considering the scoop-net's size `r`. The function handles edge cases where the scoop-net might extend beyond the boundaries of the pond. Specifically, it computes the effective range of the scoop-net in both the x and y directions, taking into account the boundaries defined by `n` and `m`, and then multiplies these ranges together to determine the total number of cells that can be covered.
