The function accepts a \(n \times m\) matrix \(A\) where each element is either 0 or 1, along with the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) (where \(2 \le n, m \le 50\)). It identifies all positions \((i+1, j+1)\) within the matrix where at least one of the four adjacent cells (top, bottom, left, right) is 1. It then checks if the number of such positions is greater than 2500. If it is, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the count of these positions followed by the positions themselves.
