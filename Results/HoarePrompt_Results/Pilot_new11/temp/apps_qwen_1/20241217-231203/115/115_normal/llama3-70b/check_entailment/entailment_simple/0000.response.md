Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Condition for Valid Operations**: The program checks if at least one of the four elements in a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix is `1` and considers that a valid operation can be performed. However, this is incorrect because the program needs to ensure that performing a \(2 \times 2\) operation on \(B\) can match the exact values in \(A\). Specifically, for each \(2 \times 2\) submatrix in \(B\), if all four elements are `0`, they should remain `0` until an operation is performed. 

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Valid Operations**: The logic inside the nested loops is flawed. It should check if the corresponding \(2 \times 2\) submatrix in \(B\) needs to be filled with `1`s to match \(A\). Instead, it only checks if any one of the four elements is `1`.

3. **Handling All \(2 \times 2\) Submatrices**: The program should consider all possible \(2 \times 2\) submatrices in \(B\) to determine if they can be used to transform \(B\) into \(A\). It should check the submatrix starting from \((i, j)\) to \((i+1, j+1)\) and ensure that the resulting submatrix matches the corresponding part of \(A\).

4. **Output Sequence of Operations**: The program prints the sequence of operations directly without ensuring that each operation is necessary and sufficient to achieve the transformation from \(B\) to \(A\).

To fix the program, it should iterate over all possible \(2 \times 2\) submatrices in \(B\) and determine whether performing an operation on that submatrix would help in transforming \(B\) to match \(A\). If so, it should add the operation to the list of operations. The final output should include all such operations that are needed to make \(B\) equal to \(A\).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if (A[i][j] == 1 and A[i+1][j] == 1 and A[i][j+1] == 1 and A[i+1][j+1] == 1) or \
               (A[i][j] == 0 and A[i+1][j] == 0 and A[i][j+1] == 0 and A[i+1][j+1] == 0):
                continue
            
            if (A[i][j] == 1 or A[i+1][j] == 1 or A[i][j+1] == 1 or A[i+1][j+1] == 1):
                ops.append((i+1, j+1))
    
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program properly checks and performs the necessary operations to transform \(B\) into \(A\).
