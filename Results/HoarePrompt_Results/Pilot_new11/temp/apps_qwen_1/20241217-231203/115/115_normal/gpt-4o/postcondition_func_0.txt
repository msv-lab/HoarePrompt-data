The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are the dimensions of a 2D list `A` containing only 0s and 1s. The function aims to identify and mark certain submatrices within `A` where all four corners are 1s, creating a new 2D list `B` of the same size as `A` where these marked submatrices are also set to 1s. It records the coordinates of these submatrices in a list called `operations`. After processing, the function checks if `A` and `B` are identical; if not, it returns -1 indicating that the two matrices do not match. If they match, the function prints the number of operations performed and the coordinates of the operations. The function can return -1 under various conditions, including when the matrices do not match or when no valid submatrices are found.
