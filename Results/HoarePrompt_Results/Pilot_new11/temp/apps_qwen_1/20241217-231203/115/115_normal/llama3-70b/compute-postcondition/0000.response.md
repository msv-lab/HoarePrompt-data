The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers between 2 and 50, and now they are assigned values from the input, those values will replace the initial placeholders.

However, since the actual values of `n` and `m` are not specified in the input, we will represent them as the input values read from the user. The matrix `A` is not defined in this code snippet, so its state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `m` is the second input integer, and `A` is a n Ã— m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.**
