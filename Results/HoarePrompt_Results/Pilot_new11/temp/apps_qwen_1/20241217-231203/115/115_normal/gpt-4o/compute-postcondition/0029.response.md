The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial state, `i` is an index, `j` is 1, and `B[i][1]` and `B[i][2]` are both 1, while `B[i + 1][1]` and `B[i + 1][2]` are also both 1. After executing the code, the value of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, but `operations` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, 2)`.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `i` is some index, `j` is 1, `B[i][1]` is 1, `B[i][2]` is 1, `B[i + 1][1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][2]` is 1, `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 2)`**
