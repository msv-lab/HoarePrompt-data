According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented again, and it must still be less than `m - 1`.

Given the conditions provided, we know:
- `A` is a 2D list of integers.
- `B` is a 2D list of integers.
- `i` retains its previous value.
- `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- The operations list either includes the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` if the condition is met or remains unchanged if the condition is not met.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from its current value (which is one more than the previous value) to be less than `m - 1`.

Let's denote the previous value of `j` as `j_prev`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j_prev + 1`.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be `j_prev + 2` and should still be less than `m - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` is the same as the previous value, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, and `operations` either includes the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` if the condition is met or remains unchanged if the condition is not met.**
