According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop condition is `j < m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the value of `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `m` must be greater than 1 (since `j` will be incremented to 1)
- `j` is now 1
- The value of `A[i][j]` will be equal to `B[i][j]` (since they were equal at the previous step and no change is mentioned in the loop body)

State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the value of A[i][j] is equal to B[i][j]**
