Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` and `j` are indices within the lists, and `operations` is a list of tuples. For each (i, j) in `operations`, the submatrix defined by `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` in `A` are all 1s, and the corresponding cells in `B` are set to 1. The `operations` list contains all the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` where the conditions were met during the loop iterations. If no such (i, j) pairs exist, then `B` and `operations` remain unchanged.**
