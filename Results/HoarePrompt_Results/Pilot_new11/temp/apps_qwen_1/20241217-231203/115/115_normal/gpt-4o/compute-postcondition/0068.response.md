According to the given code, the loop runs over the range defined by `m`. The condition for continuing the loop is that `j` should be within the range `[0, m-2]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `j` is in the range [0, m-2]
- If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `A[i][j]` remains equal to `B[i][j]`.

For the loop to continue executing, `j` must still be within the range `[0, m-2]`. If `j` were to reach `m-1` or exceed it, the loop would terminate.

Given that the loop just completed an iteration and did not return -1 (implying that `A[i][j]` was equal to `B[i][j]`), `j` must have been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` must be in the range `[1, m-1]` (since it was previously in `[0, m-2]` and has now incremented by 1).

The state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is in the range [1, m-1]**
