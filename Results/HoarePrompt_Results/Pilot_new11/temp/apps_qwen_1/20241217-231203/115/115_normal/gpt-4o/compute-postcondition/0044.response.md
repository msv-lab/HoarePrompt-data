The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified, but we know that `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, and `j` is `previous_j + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers where B[i][j], B[i][j + 1], B[i + 1][j], and B[i + 1][j + 1] are 1, and j is previous_j + 1; `operations` is a list containing a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it.**
