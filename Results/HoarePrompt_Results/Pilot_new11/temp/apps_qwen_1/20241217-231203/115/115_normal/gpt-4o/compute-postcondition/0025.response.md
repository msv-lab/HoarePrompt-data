The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial conditions, we know that `i` and `j` are indices in the 2D lists `A` and `B`, and `j` is 0. Also, `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1. 

Since `j` is 0, `j + 1` is 1. Therefore, the tuple appended to `operations` is `(i + 1, 1)`. The values of `A`, `B`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` is some index, `j` is 0, `B[i][0]` is 1, `B[i][1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][0]` is 1, `B[i + 1][1]` is 1, and `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 1)`**
