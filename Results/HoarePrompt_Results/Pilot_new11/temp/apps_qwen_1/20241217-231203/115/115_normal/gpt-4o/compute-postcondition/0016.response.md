Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is at least 1, and the 2D arrays `A` and `B` are updated according to the following rules:
- For every `(i, j)` such that `0 <= i < n-1` and `0 <= j < m-1` and `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to 1.
- The list `operations` contains all tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` that satisfy the above conditions.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each cell in the 2D array `A` except the last column (`m-1`).
- If the condition `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is met, the corresponding cells in the `B` array are set to 1 and the coordinates of these cells are added to the `operations` list.
- Since the loop continues to check all possible valid cells until the end of the iteration, the final state of the `B` array and the `operations` list will reflect all such valid cells.
- If the loop does not execute any iterations (i.e., no cells satisfy the condition), then `B` remains unchanged from its initial state and `operations` remains an empty list.
