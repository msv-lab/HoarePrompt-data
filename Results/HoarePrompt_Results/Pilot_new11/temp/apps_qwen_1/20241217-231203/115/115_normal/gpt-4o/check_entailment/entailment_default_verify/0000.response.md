Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program fails to handle cases where individual '1's in matrix `A` need to be set to '1' in matrix `B` through separate operations. The current logic only considers marking 2x2 submatrices where all four corners are '1', which leads to missing cases where individual '1's are required to be set through separate operations. 

For example, the input:
```
3 3
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1
```
The program incorrectly outputs `-1`, indicating it cannot transform matrix `B` into matrix `A`, whereas the correct output should be the sequence of operations to set the individual '1's. This demonstrates that the program does not fully meet the problem description.
