Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples. For each tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` in `operations`, the submatrix defined by `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` in `A` are all 1s, and the corresponding cells in `B` are set to 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible submatrices of size 2x2 in the 2D array `A`. Each iteration checks if the four elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1s.
- If the condition is satisfied, the corresponding cells in `B` at positions `(i, j)`, `(i, j + 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, and `(i + 1, j + 1)` are set to 1, and the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is appended to the `operations` list.
- After the loop finishes, `B` will contain 1s at the positions specified by the `operations` list, indicating that the corresponding 2x2 submatrices in `A` contained all 1s. If no such submatrices were found, `B` remains unchanged.
- The values of `n` and `m` are determined by the dimensions of `A`, and they do not change throughout the loop. The `operations` list contains all valid tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` where the conditions were met during the loop iterations.
