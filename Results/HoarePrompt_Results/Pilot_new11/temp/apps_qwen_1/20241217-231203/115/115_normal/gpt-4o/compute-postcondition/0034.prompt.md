You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We start with the following information:
   - `A` is a 2D list of integers.
   - `B` is a 2D list of integers.
   - `i` and `j` are indices within the lists.
   - `operations` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` represents a valid operation.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2` (since the upper limit is `m - 1`). This means the loop will run for `m - 1` iterations.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume:
   - `i` was the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `j` was the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `operations` contains all the valid operations performed up to this point.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m - 1`. Therefore, if we want the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `j + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `i` remains the same as there is no information indicating it should change in this context.
   - The value of `operations` remains unchanged since the loop is continuing and no new operations have been added.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` remains the same.
- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `operations` remains the same.

**State**: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` is the same as the previous value, `j` is `j + 1`, and `operations` remains the same list of tuples**.
if condition:
```
if (A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
