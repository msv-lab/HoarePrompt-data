The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. The function does not provide any specific conditions under which it would return a value other than -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `A`, and in all cases, return -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `A`, and returns -1.**
