The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect any variables directly; it merely skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `m`, `A`, `ops`, or `j`, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; the 2D list `A` has the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) all equal to 1; if at least one of the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i+1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j+1] == 1\), or \(A[i+1][j+1] == 1\) is true, then `ops` is a list containing the element \((i+1, j+1)\); `j` is \(m-1\).**
