Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 1; the 2D list `A` has the elements A[i][j], A[i + 1][j], A[i][j + 1], and A[i + 1][j + 1] all equal to 1; if at least one of the conditions A[i][j] == 1, A[i + 1][j] == 1, A[i][j + 1] == 1, or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1 is true, then `ops` is a list containing the element (i + 1, j + 1). No other changes occur in the program.***
