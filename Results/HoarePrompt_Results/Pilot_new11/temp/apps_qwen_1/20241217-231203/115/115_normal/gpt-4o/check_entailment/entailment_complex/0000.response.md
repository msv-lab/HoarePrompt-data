Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the solution for transforming matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \) by performing operations on \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices of \( B \). Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Submatrices**: The program currently checks if all four corners of a \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix in \( A \) are 1s and sets the corresponding elements in \( B \) to 1. However, this logic is not sufficient to solve the problem. The goal is to make \( B \) equal to \( A \) by performing operations, not just marking submatrices.

2. **Output Format Mismatch**: The problem requires the program to output the sequence of operations that transform \( B \) into \( A \). The current implementation only marks submatrices in \( B \) and does not generate the sequence of operations needed to achieve this transformation.

3. **No Sequence of Operations**: The program does not generate the sequence of operations required to make \( B \) equal to \( A \). Instead, it simply checks if the initial marked submatrices in \( B \) match \( A \), which is not the intended functionality.

To meet the problem description, the program needs to:
- Identify the necessary \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrices in \( A \) where all four corners are 1s.
- Generate a sequence of operations to transform \( B \) into \( A \).
- Ensure that the output includes the number of operations and the coordinates of each operation.

Here is a brief outline of how the correct solution might look:

```python
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    
    # Check if A and B are equal
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for op in operations:
        x, y = op
        B[x-1][y-1] = B[x-1][y] = B[x][y-1] = B[x][y] = 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
    
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)
```

This revised program correctly identifies the necessary submatrices and generates the sequence of operations to transform \( B \) into \( A \).
