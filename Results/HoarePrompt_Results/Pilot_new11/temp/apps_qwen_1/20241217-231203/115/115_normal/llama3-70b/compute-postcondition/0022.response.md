Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples representing coordinates `(i + 1, j + 1)` that meet certain conditions.
   - `j` is `m - 2`.
   - `i` is the last row index considered.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n - 1)`, meaning it will iterate from `0` to `n - 2`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the last row index considered.
   - Since the loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2`, if we are at the end of the previous iteration, the current value of `i` must be `n - 2`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n - 1`.
   - The value of `j` does not change based on the loop itself but is set as `m - 2`.
   - `m` remains unchanged as the loop does not affect it.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `i` needs to be updated to `n - 1` (to start the next iteration).
   - `j` remains `m - 2`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `m` must still be greater than 1.
   - `ops` remains the same.
   - `j` is `m - 2`.
   - `i` is now `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples of coordinates `(i + 1, j + 1)` for which the conditions `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are true, `j` is `m - 2`, and `i` is `n - 1`**.
