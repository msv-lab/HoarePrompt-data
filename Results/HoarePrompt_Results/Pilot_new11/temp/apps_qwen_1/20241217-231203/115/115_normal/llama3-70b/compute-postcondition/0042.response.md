Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
1. `m` must be greater than 1.
2. The 2D list `A` has the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) all equal to 1 for all valid indices within the bounds of the list.
3. `ops` is a list containing all valid pairs \((i+1, j+1)\) for which the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i+1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j+1] == 1\), or \(A[i+1][j+1] == 1\) are true.
4. `j` is 0.
5. `i` is \(n-2\).

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.
- Initially, `j` is set to 0.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `m - 1`.

Given the initial state where `j` is 0, we need `j < m - 1` to be true for the loop to start its first iteration.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. **Ensure `j` is less than `m - 1`:**
   - Since `j` is initially 0, we need to ensure that `m - 1` is greater than 0.
   - This means `m` must be greater than 1 (which is already given).

Since `j` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 1, the condition `j < m - 1` is satisfied if `m > 1`.

### Final State:
- We need to ensure that the loop can start its first iteration, which requires `m > 1` and `j` being 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0**
