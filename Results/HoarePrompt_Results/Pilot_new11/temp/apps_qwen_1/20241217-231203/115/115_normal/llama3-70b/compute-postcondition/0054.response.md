Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - \( m > 1 \)
   - \( j = 1 \)
   - If \( A[i][j] == 1 \) or \( A[i + 1][j] == 1 \) or \( A[i][j + 1] == 1 \) or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1 \), no change is made to the variables.
   - Otherwise, the variables remain as they were initially.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(m - 1):
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from \( j = 0 \) to \( j = m - 2 \).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( j = 1 \).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( j \) must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, \( j \) should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Conditions for No Change**:
   - The condition \( A[i][j] == 1 \) or \( A[i + 1][j] == 1 \) or \( A[i][j + 1] == 1 \) or \( A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1 \) does not affect the value of \( j \) directly.
   - If this condition is true, the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, they remain as they were initially.

6. **Updated State**:
   - \( m > 1 \) (remains unchanged)
   - \( j = 2 \) (incremented by 1)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`m > 1` and `j = 2`**
