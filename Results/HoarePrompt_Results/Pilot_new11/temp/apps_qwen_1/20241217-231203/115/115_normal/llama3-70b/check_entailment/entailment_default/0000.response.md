Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly transform matrix \( B \) into matrix \( A \). According to the problem description, each operation involves setting a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix of \( B \) to \(1\). However, the current implementation only checks if the four elements of a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix are already \(1\) and skips those positions. Instead, it should set the four elements to \(1\) if at least one of them needs to be changed to \(1\) to match \( A \).

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
```
The correct sequence of operations would be:
```
1 1
1 2
2 2
```
This sequence changes the appropriate \(2 \times 2\) submatrices to match \( A \). However, the provided code does not perform these operations correctly. It simply checks if the conditions are already met without actually changing the matrix \( B \).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
