Postcondition: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` has the same value as the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`, and `operations` remains the same list of tuples. Additionally, `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are true.**
