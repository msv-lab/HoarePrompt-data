The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The elements `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `B[i + 1][0]`, and `B[i + 1][1]` are also unchanged. The only change is the addition of the tuple to the `operations` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `i` is an index in the 2D array, `j` is 1, and the elements `B[i][0]`, `B[i][1]`, `B[i + 1][0]`, and `B[i + 1][1]` are set to 1; `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, 2)`.**
