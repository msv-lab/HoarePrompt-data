The code `continue` is used within a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0. The elements `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1.**
