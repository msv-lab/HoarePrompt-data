The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `m` and `j` remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are also not affected.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1 and `j` is 2**
