Let's break down the given problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
   - `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50.
   - `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
   - `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0.
   - `operations` is a list of tuples.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `m-1`.
   - The value of `print(len(operations))` is executed.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the `operations` list using `for op in operations`.

3. **Determining Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the `operations` list must contain at least one element. If `operations` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on the length of the `operations` list, we need to ensure that `len(operations)` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `operations` contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one element, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and the value of `print(len(operations))` is executed.**
