The code prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` from the `operations` list. These values are already determined before the print statement is executed, so the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` remain unchanged. The only action taken by this line of code is printing these values. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `m` is a positive integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of size `n` by `m` where each element is 0, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is the index of the next tuple's first element, `j` is the index of the next tuple's second element, and `op[0]` and `op[1]` are printed from the `operations` list.**
