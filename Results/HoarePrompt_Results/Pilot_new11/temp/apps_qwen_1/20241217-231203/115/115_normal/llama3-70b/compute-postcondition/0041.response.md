According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to \(n-2\). At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` is \(n-1\), which means that the loop should stop since it would not execute for `i = n-1`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be decreased by 1, so it becomes \(n-2\). Since `i` starts from \(n-1\), it will only decrement once for the current loop, making it \(n-2\).

Additionally, `j` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than \(n-1\), which it now is.

The state of the 2D list `A` and the list `ops` does not change unless the loop body modifies them, but since the problem statement mentions that these elements are already set and no modifications are specified, we assume they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`m` must be greater than 1; the 2D list `A` has the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) all equal to 1 for all valid indices within the bounds of the list; `ops` is a list containing all valid pairs \((i+1, j+1)\) for which the conditions \(A[i][j] == 1\), \(A[i+1][j] == 1\), \(A[i][j+1] == 1\), or \(A[i+1][j+1] == 1\) are true; `j` is 0; `i` is \(n-2\)**.
