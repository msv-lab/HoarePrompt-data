The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are unknown initially, but `j` is known to be 2. The value of `i` is unknown, so the exact values in the tuple cannot be determined. However, the operation is performed based on the current values of `i` and `j`.

Since the condition for changing the state is not met (it only changes the state if `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)`), the state remains unchanged. The only change is the addition of the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `i` is unknown; `ops` is a list containing the element `(i + 1, j + 1)`.**
