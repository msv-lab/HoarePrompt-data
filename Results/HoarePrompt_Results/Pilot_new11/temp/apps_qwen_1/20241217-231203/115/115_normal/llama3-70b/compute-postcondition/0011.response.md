According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop condition is `for j in range(m - 1)`, meaning `j` must be less than `m - 1` for the loop to continue.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
- Since `j` must be less than `m - 1`, `m` must still be greater than 2 (because if `m` were 2 or less, `m - 1` would be 1 or less, and `j` could not be 1).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `m` must be greater than 2.
- `j` will be 1.

State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 1**
