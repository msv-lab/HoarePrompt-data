The code appends a new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is the same as its previous value, and `j` is `j_prev + 2`. Therefore, the new tuple added to `operations` will be `(i + 1, j_prev + 3)`. The 2D lists `A` and `B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers with elements `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` set to `1`, `i` is the same as the previous value, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, and `operations` includes the new tuple `(i + 1, j_prev + 3)` if the condition is met or remains unchanged if the condition is not met.**
