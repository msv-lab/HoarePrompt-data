The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `i` is unknown.**
