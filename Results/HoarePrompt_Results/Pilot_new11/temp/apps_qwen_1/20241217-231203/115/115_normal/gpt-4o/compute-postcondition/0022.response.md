Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers, and `B` is also a 2D list of integers. `i` and `j` are indices within the list such that the submatrix defined by `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j+1]`, `A[i+1][j]`, and `A[i+1][j+1]` all equal 1. If this condition is met, then `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `operations` is a list with an additional element `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it. Otherwise, the values of `A`, `B`, `i`, `j`, and `operations` remain unchanged.***
