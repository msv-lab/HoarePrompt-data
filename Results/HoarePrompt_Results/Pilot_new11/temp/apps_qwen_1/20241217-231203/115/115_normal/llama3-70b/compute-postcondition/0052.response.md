The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. However, since the initial state does not provide the value of `i` and `A` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values being appended. But we know that `i + 1` and `j + 1` are added to the list `ops`.

Given the conditions in the initial state, `m > 1` and `j = 1`, these conditions are not directly affected by the code. The only change is the addition of a tuple to the list `ops`.

Output State: **`m > 1`, `j = 1`, `ops` contains a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
