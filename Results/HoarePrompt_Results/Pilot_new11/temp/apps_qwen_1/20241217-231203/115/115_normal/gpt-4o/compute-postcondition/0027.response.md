To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m - 2`.
2. The condition inside the loop sets certain elements of `B` and appends to `operations` if specific conditions are met.

Given the conditions at the end of the previous iteration:
- `A` is a 2D list of integers.
- `B` is a 2D list of integers.
- `i` is some index.
- `j` is 0.

The loop increments `j` at each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `1`.

The key points to consider are:
- Whether the loop can execute again based on the value of `j`.
- No specific changes are mentioned to `A` or `B` outside of the condition being checked.
- The condition to check involves `A[i][j]` and `A[i][j + 1]` as well as `A[i + 1][j]` and `A[i + 1][j + 1]`.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, the new value of `j` will be `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `A` is a 2D list of integers.
- `B` is a 2D list of integers.
- `i` is some index.
- `j` is `1`.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of integers, `i` is some index, `j` is 1**
