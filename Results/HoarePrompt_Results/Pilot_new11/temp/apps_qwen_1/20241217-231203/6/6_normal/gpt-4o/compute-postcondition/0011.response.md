`move_to_r` is assigned the value of `abs(pos - r)`. The value of `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and the value of `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `(r != n)`. The `abs(pos - r)` function calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `r`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `(r != n)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, and `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `(r != n)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`**
