The code `print('Yes')` does not affect any variables. It simply prints 'Yes' to the console. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `y` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order (potentially different from the original order), and the current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`**
