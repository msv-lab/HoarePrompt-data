The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. The initial state of `n` (an input integer) and `y` (a list of n integers) remains unchanged. 

Since the input is not specified in this example, let's denote the input as `input_str`. The code will split `input_str` into a list of integers and assign it to `x`. The length of this list will be `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, and the values in `x` are the integers from the input string converted to integers.**
