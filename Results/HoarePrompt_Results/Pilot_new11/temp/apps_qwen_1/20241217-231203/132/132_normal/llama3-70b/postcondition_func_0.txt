The function accepts an integer `n` and two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` integers. It first checks if the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`. If not, it prints 'No' and exits. If the sums are equal, it sorts both lists `x` and `y` in ascending order. After sorting, it checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` and `y` are either printed as 'Yes' or 'No', and the input values are no longer modified within the function. Potential edge cases include when `n` is at its boundaries (1 or 50), and when the lists `x` and `y` contain identical elements in different orders.
