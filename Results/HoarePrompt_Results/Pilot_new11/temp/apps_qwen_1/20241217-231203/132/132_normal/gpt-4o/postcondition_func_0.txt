The function `func()` accepts no explicit parameters but reads two lists of integers `x` and `y` from the standard input, where each list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive. The function calculates the sum of the elements in both lists (`total_x` for `x` and `total_y` for `y`). After calculating these sums, the function checks if `total_y` is greater than `total_x`. If `total_y` is greater, the function prints "No" to the console; otherwise, it prints "Yes". The final state of the program includes the input integer `n`, the lists `x` and `y`, and the sums `total_x` and `total_y`. There are no explicit outputs returned by the function, but it modifies the standard output based on the comparison of `total_x` and `total_y`.
