Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, and `y` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order (potentially different from the original order). If `x` is equal to `y`, the function continues without any change. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the console prints 'No'.***
