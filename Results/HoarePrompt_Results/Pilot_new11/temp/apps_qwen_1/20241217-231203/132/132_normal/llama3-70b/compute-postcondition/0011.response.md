The code `print('No')` prints the string 'No' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `x`, or `y`. The only change is the output to the console. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `y` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order (potentially different from the original order), and `x` is not equal to `y`. The console prints 'No'.**
