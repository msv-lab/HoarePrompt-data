The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the only thing affected is that the string 'No' is printed, but this is not included in the variable states.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`, and `total_y` is the sum of all elements in the list `y`. The total value of `total_y` is greater than the total value of `total_x`.**
