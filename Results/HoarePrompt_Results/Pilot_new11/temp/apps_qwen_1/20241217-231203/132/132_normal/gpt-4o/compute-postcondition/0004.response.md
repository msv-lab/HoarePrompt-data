`total_y` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `y`. The previous value of `total_y` was 0 (as it was not initialized or mentioned before), and now it is updated to the sum of all elements in `y`. The values of `n`, `y`, `x`, and `total_x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`, and `total_y` is the sum of all elements in the list `y`.**
