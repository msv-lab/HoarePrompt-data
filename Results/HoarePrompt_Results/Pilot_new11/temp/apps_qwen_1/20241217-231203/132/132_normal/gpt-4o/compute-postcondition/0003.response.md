`total_x` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `x`. The sum function adds up all the integers in the list `x`, resulting in an integer value for `total_x`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `y`, and `x`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, and `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 1000 inclusive, and `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`**.
