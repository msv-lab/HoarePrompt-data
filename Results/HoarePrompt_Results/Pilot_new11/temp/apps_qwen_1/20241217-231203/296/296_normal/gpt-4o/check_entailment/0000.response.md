Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that the sum of the fractions must equal \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). The current implementation only constructs a sequence of fractions where each denominator is a divisor of \(n\) and the numerators are 1. However, it does not ensure that the sum of these fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\).

For example, consider \(n = 6\). The divisors of 6 are 2 and 3. The program constructs the fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\), but their sum is \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}\), which is indeed \(1 - \frac{1}{6}\). This specific case works correctly.

However, consider \(n = 8\). The divisors of 8 are 2 and 4. The program constructs the fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\), but their sum is \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\), which is not \(1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}\).

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement for some values of \(n\), making it incorrect.
