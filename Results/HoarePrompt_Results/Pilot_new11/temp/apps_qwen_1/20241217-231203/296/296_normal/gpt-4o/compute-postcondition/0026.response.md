The code creates a list of tuples `fractions` where each tuple contains the pair `(1, d)` for each divisor `d` in the list `divisors`. The variable `divisors` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`i` and `k`) also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 < n \leq 10^9\), `divisors` is a list containing all divisors of `n` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `i` is the last divisor found (or `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` if no divisors were found), `k` is the length of the list `divisors`, and `fractions` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(1, d)` for each `d` in `divisors`.**
