The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9. The function has two possible return values: 

- Case_1: The function returns 'NO'.
- Case_2: The function returns 'NO'.
- Case_3: The function returns 'YES\nk\n' followed by each tuple (a, b) from the list `fractions` in the format 'a b', where `k` is the length of the list `divisors` and `fractions` is a list of tuples (1, d) for each divisor `d` in `divisors`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 'NO', 'YES\nk\n' followed by specific tuples, or handle cases based on the conditions involving divisors and fractions.
