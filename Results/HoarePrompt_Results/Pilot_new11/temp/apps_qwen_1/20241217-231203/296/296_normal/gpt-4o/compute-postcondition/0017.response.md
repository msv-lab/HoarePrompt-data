The code `divisors.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `divisors`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is `prev_i + 2`. Therefore, `i` is appended to `divisors`. No other changes are made to the variables.

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `divisors` includes `prev_i`, `n // prev_i`, or `n // (prev_i + 1)`, `i` is `prev_i + 2`, `divisors` now includes `i`, and if `prev_i + 2 != n // (prev_i + 1)`, then `n // (prev_i + 2)` is added to `divisors`.**
