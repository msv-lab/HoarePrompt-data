The code snippet `divisors.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state where `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration of the loop and `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1, the value of `i` at the end of the current iteration is added to `divisors`.

Since the value of `i` is updated in the loop, the new value of `i` will be one more than its previous value. However, without knowing the exact initial value of `i`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

After appending `i` to `divisors`, the following variables are affected:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `divisors` includes the current value of `i`.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `divisors` includes the value of `i`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
