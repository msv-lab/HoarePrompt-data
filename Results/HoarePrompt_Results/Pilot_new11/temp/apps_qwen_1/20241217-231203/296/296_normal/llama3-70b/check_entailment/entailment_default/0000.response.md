Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to generate a sequence of fractions that satisfies the given conditions for all possible values of \( n \).

For \( n = 2 \), the code correctly outputs "NO". However, for other values of \( n \), the code generates a sequence with only two fractions, which is insufficient to achieve the sum \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). For example, consider \( n = 6 \):

- The code outputs:
  ```
  YES
  2
  1 3
  1 6
  ```

This sequence sums to:
\[ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \neq 1 - \frac{1}{6} \]

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed to generate a sequence of fractions that can accurately sum to \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \) for any \( n \). The current implementation is not sufficient to cover all cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
