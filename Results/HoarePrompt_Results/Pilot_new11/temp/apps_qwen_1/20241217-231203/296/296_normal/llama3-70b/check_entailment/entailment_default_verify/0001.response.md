Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle cases where \( n \) is a prime number. For such cases, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" and provides a sequence of fractions, which is not valid since no such sequence exists for prime numbers. The output hints do not address this specific issue, as they focus on the general behavior of the program without specifying how it handles prime numbers. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
