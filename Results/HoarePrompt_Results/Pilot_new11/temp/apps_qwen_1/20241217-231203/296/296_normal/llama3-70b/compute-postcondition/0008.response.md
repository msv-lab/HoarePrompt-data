The code `print('1', n)` prints the string '1' followed by the value of `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `k` remains unchanged. The initial print statement also outputs 'n' to the console.

Output State: **`YES` is printed to the console, `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to \(10^9\), inclusive, and not equal to 2; `k` is 2; printed values are '1' and `n // 2'; '1' and `n` are printed to the console.**
