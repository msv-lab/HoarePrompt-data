The code `print(k)` simply prints the value of `k` to the console and does not change the value of `k`. Since `k` is initially set to 2, the output state remains the same for `n` (which is an integer within the range of 2 to \(10^9\), inclusive, and not equal to 2) and `k` (which is 2). The initial action of printing "YES" to the console does not affect the variables `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`YES` is printed to the console, `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to \(10^9\), inclusive, and not equal to 2; `k` is 2**
