The code `print('1', n // 2)` prints '1' followed by `n // 2`. Here, `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to \(10^9\), inclusive, and not equal to 2, and `k` is 2. The print statement does not change the values of the variables, but it outputs '1' and `n // 2`.

Output State: **`YES` is printed to the console, `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to \(10^9\), inclusive, and not equal to 2; `k` is 2; printed values are '1' and `n // 2`.**
