Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 < n \leq 10^9\), `divisors` is a list containing 2 and `n // i` (where `i` is either 2 or the smallest divisor of `n` other than 1), `i` is 2, `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` + 1, and `i` is not equal to `n // i`.***

Explanation: The if condition checks if `i` is not equal to `n // i`. If true, it means `i` is a divisor of `n` and we add `n // i` to the `divisors` list. Since the else part is not present, the condition for the else part does not apply. Therefore, the postcondition includes the case where `i` is added as a divisor if it is not equal to `n // i`.
