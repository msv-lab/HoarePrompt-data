Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not related to the problem statement. The problem requires counting the number of permutations of integers \(1, 2, ..., n\) such that \(f(p) = f_{max}(n)\), where \(f(p)\) is defined based on the GCD of the prefix of the permutation.

The program's current implementation only calculates the factorial of `n-1` and returns it, which does not address the required logic to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n-1` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This does not compute the number of permutations with the desired property as described in the problem statement.

2. **Missing Core Logic**: The core logic to determine \(f(p)\) and find permutations that maximize \(f(p)\) is entirely missing. The program needs to handle the logic for calculating \(f(p)\) for each permutation and counting those that achieve \(f_{max}(n)\).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Implement the logic to calculate \(f(p)\) for each permutation.
- Find the maximum value of \(f(p)\) over all permutations.
- Count the number of permutations that achieve this maximum value.

The provided program fails to meet these requirements and hence is incorrect according to the problem description.
