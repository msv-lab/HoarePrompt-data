According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` starting from `f_max_n` and decrementing until `j` reaches 0. At the end of the last iteration, we need to determine the updated values of the relevant variables for the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp[0]` is 1.
   - For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` starts from `f_max_n` and decrements.
   - For each `j`, `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2 (remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop).
   - `j` is now `f_max_n - 1` because the loop decremented `j` from `f_max_n` to `1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will now be `f_max_n - 2` (since the loop decrements `j` again).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The value of `dp[j]` for `j = f_max_n - 1` is already updated to be the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `f_max_n - 1` (last digit form).
   - `dp[j - 1]` (which is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`) will be incremented by `dp[f_max_n - 1]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

- `i` remains 2.
- `j` becomes `f_max_n - 2`.
- `dp[j]` (which is `dp[f_max_n - 2]`) is updated to be the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `f_max_n - 2`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `MOD` is 10; `dp[0]` is 1; for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`; `i` is 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; for each `j`, `dp[j]` is incremented by `dp[j - 1]`.**
