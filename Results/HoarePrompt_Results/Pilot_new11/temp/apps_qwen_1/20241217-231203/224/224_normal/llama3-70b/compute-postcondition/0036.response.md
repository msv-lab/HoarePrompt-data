Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10, `i` is `n`, `j` is `f_max_n`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Constraints**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer, representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`.
   - `MOD` is set to 10.
   - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` containing only zeros except for `dp[0]` which is 1.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `n`, incrementing `i` from `1` to `n`.
   - The inner loop runs from `f_max_n` down to `1`, decrementing `j` from `f_max_n` to `1`.

3. **Effect of the Inner Loop**:
   - For each iteration of the outer loop (`i`), the inner loop updates `dp[j]` for each `j` from `f_max_n` down to `1`.
   - The update rule is `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]`, and the result is taken modulo `10`.
   - This means that for each `j`, `dp[j]` becomes the cumulative sum of all integers from `1` to `j` modulo `10`.

4. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` because the outer loop runs from `1` to `n`.
   - `j` will be `f_max_n` because the inner loop starts from `f_max_n` and goes down to `1`.
   - `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` will be the cumulative sum of all integers from `1` to `j` modulo `10`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop ensures that `dp[j]` for all `j` from `1` to `f_max_n` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from `1` to `j`, taken modulo `10`.
   - Since the loop always runs from `1` to `n`, `i` will be `n` and `j` will be `f_max_n` after the loop completes.

Thus, the final output state is that `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `f_max_n`.
