Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` simply calculates the factorial of `n-1`, which does not address the problem of finding permutations with the maximum value of \( f(p) \).

To understand why this program is incorrect, let's consider the following:

1. **Understanding \( f(p) \)**: The function \( f(p) \) is defined based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the prefixes of the permutation \( p \). The goal is to maximize the number of distinct GCD values among these prefixes.

2. **Example Analysis**: For \( n = 3 \), the permutations are:
   - [1, 2, 3]: \( g_1 = 1 \), \( g_2 = \text{gcd}(1, 2) = 1 \), \( g_3 = \text{gcd}(1, 2, 3) = 1 \) → \( f(p) = 1 \)
   - [1, 3, 2]: \( g_1 = 1 \), \( g_2 = \text{gcd}(1, 3) = 1 \), \( g_3 = \text{gcd}(1, 3, 2) = 1 \) → \( f(p) = 1 \)
   - [2, 1, 3]: \( g_1 = 2 \), \( g_2 = \text{gcd}(2, 1) = 1 \), \( g_3 = \text{gcd}(2, 1, 3) = 1 \) → \( f(p) = 2 \)
   - [2, 3, 1]: \( g_1 = 2 \), \( g_2 = \text{gcd}(2, 3) = 1 \), \( g_3 = \text{gcd}(2, 3, 1) = 1 \) → \( f(p) = 2 \)
   - [3, 1, 2]: \( g_1 = 3 \), \( g_2 = \text{gcd}(3, 1) = 1 \), \( g_3 = \text{gcd}(3, 1, 2) = 1 \) → \( f(p) = 2 \)
   - [3, 2, 1]: \( g_1 = 3 \), \( g_2 = \text{gcd}(3, 2) = 1 \), \( g_3 = \text{gcd}(3, 2, 1) = 1 \) → \( f(p) = 2 \)

   Here, \( f_{max}(3) = 2 \), and there are 4 permutations achieving this maximum value.

3. **Program Analysis**: The program attempts to calculate the factorial of \( n-1 \), which is irrelevant to the problem of finding permutations with the maximum \( f(p) \). This approach does not account for the GCD logic or the requirement to count permutations with the maximum \( f(p) \).

Since the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem, it fails to produce the correct output for the given examples and potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
