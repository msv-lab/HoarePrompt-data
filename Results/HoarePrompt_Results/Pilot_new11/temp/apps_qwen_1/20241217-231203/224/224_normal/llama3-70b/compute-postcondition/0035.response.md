Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `dp[j]` is the last digit of `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` (modulo 10).**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp[0]` is 1.
   - For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
       dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
       dp[j] %= MOD
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `f_max_n` down to 1.
   - In each iteration, `dp[j]` is updated to be the sum of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, and then taken modulo 10.
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be 0.
   - The final state of `dp[j]` for each `j` from 2 to `f_max_n` will be the cumulative sum of the last digits of the sums of all integers up to `j`, modulo 10.

4. **Final Values**:
   - `n` remains within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` remains a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `MOD` remains 10.
   - `dp[0]` remains 1.
   - For all `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the last digit of the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j`.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `j` will be 0 after the loop completes.
   - `dp[0]` will be the last digit of `dp[0] + dp[0 - 1]` (which is `dp[0] + dp[-1]`, but since `dp[-1]` is not defined, we take `dp[0]` as the starting point).

Thus, the final output state after the loop executes all iterations is as described above.
