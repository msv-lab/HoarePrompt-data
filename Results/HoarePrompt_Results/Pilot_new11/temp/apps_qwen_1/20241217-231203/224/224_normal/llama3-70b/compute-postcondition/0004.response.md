State before the loop starts: `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` containing only zeros except for `dp[0]` which is 1.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Initialization of `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in reverse from `f_max_n` to `1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `f_max_n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

2. **State of `dp` list:**
   - `dp` is initialized as a list of length `f_max_n + 1` containing only zeros, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 1.
   - This initialization is already correct and does not require adjustment.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `n`, `f_max_n`, and `MOD` are already given in the initial state and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the key state that needs to be adjusted is that `f_max_n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) to ensure the loop can start executing.

State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` containing only zeros except for `dp[0]` which is 1**
