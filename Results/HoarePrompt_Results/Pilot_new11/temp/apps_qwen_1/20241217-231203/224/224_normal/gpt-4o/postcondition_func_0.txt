The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and `mod` (an integer representing \(10^9 + 7\)). It calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function iterates from 2 to `n`, multiplying each number to the `result` variable and taking modulo `mod` at each step to prevent overflow. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 2 or 10^6, as these will still be within the defined range. There is no missing functionality noted based on the provided code and annotations.
