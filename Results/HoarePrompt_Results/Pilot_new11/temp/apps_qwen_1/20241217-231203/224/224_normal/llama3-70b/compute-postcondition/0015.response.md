Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop variable `j` iterates from `f_max_n` down to `1`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range of `f_max_n` to `1`.

2. **Initial Values and States**:
   - `n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
   - `MOD` is set to 10.
   - `dp[0]` is 1.
   - For all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10.
   - `i` is `i + 1` (this seems to be an increment operation, but it doesn't affect the loop itself).

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 1.

Given this, the key state adjustments needed are:
- `f_max_n` should be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to start.
- The loop runs backwards from `f_max_n` to 1, so `j` must be within this range.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure the loop can start executing.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is within the range 2 to \(10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 10, `dp[0]` is 1, for all `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all integers from 1 to `j` modulo 10, `j` starts at `f_max_n` and decreases to 1**
