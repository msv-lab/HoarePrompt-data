Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented for calculating the GCD, but `func_3` does not accurately compute the number of permutations that achieve the maximum value of \( f(p) \).

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Understanding \( f_{max}(n) \)**: For a permutation \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \), \( f(p) \) is defined as the number of distinct GCDs of all prefixes of \( p \). The maximum value \( f_{max}(n) \) is the highest possible value of \( f(p) \) over all such permutations.

2. **Calculating \( f_{max}(n) \)**: The function `func_2` attempts to calculate \( f_{max}(n) \), but it has a flaw. It calculates the GCD of a sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \) iteratively, which is not the same as finding the maximum number of distinct GCDs achievable by any permutation of those numbers. For instance, for \( n = 6 \), the correct \( f_{max}(6) \) is 3, but `func_2` would incorrectly return 1.

3. **Permutations Calculation**: The function `func_3` uses dynamic programming to count the number of permutations achieving \( f_{max}(n) \). However, it relies on an incorrect calculation of \( f_{max}(n) \), making the entire approach flawed.

To illustrate, let's consider the case when \( n = 6 \):

- The correct \( f_{max}(6) \) is 3, which can be achieved by permutations like \([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\) and others where the GCDs of prefixes are 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3.
- The program will not correctly handle this case because it misidentifies \( f_{max}(6) \).

Thus, since the program does not correctly identify \( f_{max}(n) \) for at least one case, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
