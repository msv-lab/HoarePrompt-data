The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). After executing the function body, the function returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and return their greatest common divisor (GCD).
