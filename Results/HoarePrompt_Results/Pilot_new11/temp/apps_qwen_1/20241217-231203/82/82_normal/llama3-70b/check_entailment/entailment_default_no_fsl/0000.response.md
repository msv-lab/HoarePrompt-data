Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code uses a brute-force approach to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. However, this approach may not be efficient for large values of \( a \) and \( b \) due to its time complexity. More importantly, the code does not handle all potential edge cases correctly.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not consider the case where \( a \) and \( b \) are equal. When \( a = b \), the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is always \( a + k \), and the minimum \( k \) should be 0. However, the provided code does not handle this scenario properly.

2. **Brute-Force Search**: The brute-force search for the minimum LCM can be inefficient for large values of \( a \) and \( b \). A more efficient approach would be to use properties of LCM and GCD.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
- Input: \( a = 10 \), \( b = 10 \)
- Expected Output: \( k = 0 \)
- Actual Output: The code will increment \( k \) until it finds a value that minimizes the LCM, which in this case is \( k = 0 \).

However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this edge case, leading to potential inefficiency and incorrect behavior for specific inputs.

A more robust solution would involve leveraging the properties of LCM and GCD to directly compute the optimal \( k \).
