The code snippet updates the values of `a` and `b`. Specifically, `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Based on the initial state, `a` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, and `b` is the original value of `a` from the previous iteration.

After executing the code:
- `a` is updated to the original value of `b`.
- `b` is updated to the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`a` is the original value of `b`; `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.**
