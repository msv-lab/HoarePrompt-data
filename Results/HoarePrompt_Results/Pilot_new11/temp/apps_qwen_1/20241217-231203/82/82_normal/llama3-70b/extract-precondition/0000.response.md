Precondition: **a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.** 

**func_1(a, b)** is a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b, as indicated by its usage in the least common multiple (LCM) calculation within the `func_2` function. However, since the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot extract more specific preconditions for the variables a and b beyond their basic constraints.
