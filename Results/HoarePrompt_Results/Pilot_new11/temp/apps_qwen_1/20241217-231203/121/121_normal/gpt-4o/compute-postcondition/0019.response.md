Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` now contains at least one character, `target_count` is `n // 4`, and for each key in `counts` ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'), the value is 1. If `char` is a character from `s`, then `counts[char]` is set to 1. If `char` is not in `counts`, `counts[char]` remains unchanged.***
