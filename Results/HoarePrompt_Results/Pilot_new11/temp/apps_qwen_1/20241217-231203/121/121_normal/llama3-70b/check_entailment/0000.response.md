Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the genome by replacing each '?' with one of the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that the count of each nucleotide is equal. Here's why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a dictionary `count` to keep track of the number of each type of nucleotide present in the string except for '?'.

2. **Counting Nucleotides**: It iterates through the input string and increments the count for the respective nucleotide if the character is not '?'.

3. **Calculating Average Count**: The average count (`avg`) of each nucleotide needed to ensure equal counts is calculated as `n // 4`.

4. **Replacing '?'**: For each '?', it tries to replace it with a nucleotide that has not yet reached its average count.

5. **Validation**: After attempting to replace all '?', it checks if any nucleotide still has an imbalance. If so, it prints '===', indicating it's not possible to decode the genome. Otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

This approach ensures that the program works for all valid inputs as per the problem description. It handles the edge cases where it might not be possible to decode the genome (e.g., when the total number of nucleotides cannot be evenly divided among the four types).
