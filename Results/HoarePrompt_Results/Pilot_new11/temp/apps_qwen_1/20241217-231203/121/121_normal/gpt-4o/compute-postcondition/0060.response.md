`counts[char]` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `counts[char]` increases by 1. The value of `char` remains unchanged, and the value of `result[i]` also remains `char`. The initial conditions that `counts` is not an empty dictionary and `char` exists in `counts` with a value less than `target_count` still hold.

Output State: **`counts[char]` is increased by 1, `char` exists in `counts` and the value of `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`, `result[i]` is `char`**
