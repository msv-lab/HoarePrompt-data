Postcondition: ***`nc` is the next character in the sequence 'ACGT' after the previous `nc`. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, and `res` is updated to its previous value plus `nc`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the values of `count[nc]` and `res` remain unchanged.***
