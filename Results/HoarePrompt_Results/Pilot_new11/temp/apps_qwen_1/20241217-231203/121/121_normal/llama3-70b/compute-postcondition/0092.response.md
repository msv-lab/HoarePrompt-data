Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values updated based on the characters in `s`, `avg` is `n // 4`. If `any(count.values())` is `True`, `res` is the longest prefix of `s` that consists of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the order 'ACGT' based on their counts in `count`, and the console output is '==='. Otherwise, `res` is an empty string, and `any(count.values())` is `False`.***
