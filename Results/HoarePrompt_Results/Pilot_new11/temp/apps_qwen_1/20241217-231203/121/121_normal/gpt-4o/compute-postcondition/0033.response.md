Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value from the string in `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `target_count` is `n // 4`, and `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is the count of occurrences of that character in the string `s`. If the count of `char` in `counts` is greater than `target_count`, the function does not perform any specific action (the postcondition remains as the precondition). Otherwise, the function also does not perform any specific action (the postcondition remains as the precondition).***
