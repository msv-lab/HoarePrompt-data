The code `print('===')` simply prints the string '===' to the console. It does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the string from `data[0]`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the string representation of the new integer `n` and the second element is `s`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a non-empty dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where the value of each key is the count of occurrences of that character in the string `s`, and `char` is the next character in the keys of `counts` (either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'), and the console prints '==='**
