`res` is assigned the value of `res` plus `nc`. The value of `nc` is the next character in the sequence 'ACGT' after the previous `nc`, and `count[nc]` and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nc` is the next character in the sequence 'ACGT' after the previous `nc`, `count[nc]` remains unchanged, and `res` is equal to its previous value plus `nc`.

Output State: **`nc` is the next character in the sequence 'ACGT' after the previous `nc`, `count[nc]` remains unchanged, and `res` is equal to its previous value plus `nc`**
