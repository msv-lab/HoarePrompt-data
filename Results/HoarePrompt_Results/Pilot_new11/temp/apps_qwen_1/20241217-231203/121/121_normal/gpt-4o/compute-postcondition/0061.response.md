The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. In this case, it will exit the loop or conditional statement where `counts[char]` is being checked and updated, and where `result[i]` is being assigned `char`. However, the code does not change the values of the variables themselves; it only breaks out of the loop or conditional statement.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`counts[char]` is increased by 1, `char` exists in `counts` and the value of `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`, `result[i]` is `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
