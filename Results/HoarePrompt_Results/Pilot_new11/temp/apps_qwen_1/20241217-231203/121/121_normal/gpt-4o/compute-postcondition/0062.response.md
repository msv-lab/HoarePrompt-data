Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary where `char` exists, and if `counts[char]` was less than `target_count`, it is now increased by 1, `result[i]` is set to `char`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `counts[char]` was not less than `target_count`, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
