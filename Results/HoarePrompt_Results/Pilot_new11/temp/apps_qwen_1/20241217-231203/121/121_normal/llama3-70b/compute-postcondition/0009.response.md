Postcondition: ***`n` is the integer value of the first input line, `s` is the remaining string after removing the first character, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values representing the count of corresponding characters in the remaining string `s`. If the character `c` is not '?', then `count[c]` is incremented by 1. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
