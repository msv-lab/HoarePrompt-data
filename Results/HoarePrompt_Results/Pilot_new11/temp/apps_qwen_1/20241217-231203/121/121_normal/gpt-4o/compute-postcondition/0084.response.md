`counts[char]` is incremented by 1, which means the count of the character `char` in the `counts` iterable is increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`next_char`, `next_count`, and `result[i]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`counts` is a non-empty iterable, `next_char` is the next character in the iterable, `next_count` is greater than or equal to `target_count`, and `result[i]` is equal to `next_char`; the count of `char` in `counts` is increased by 1.**
