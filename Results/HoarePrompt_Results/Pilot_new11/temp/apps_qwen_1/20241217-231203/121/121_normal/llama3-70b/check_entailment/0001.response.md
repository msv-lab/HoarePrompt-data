Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases correctly based on the problem description. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Counting Nucleotides**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the input string `s`, excluding the question marks ('?').

2. **Calculating Averages**: The program calculates the average number of each type of nucleotide required (`avg = n // 4`), ensuring that each type will have an equal number.

3. **Replacements**: For each question mark ('?'), the program replaces it with the most suitable nucleotide to maintain the balance. It iterates through 'ACGT' and uses the first available nucleotide that still has a positive count.

4. **Validation**: After making replacements, the program checks if all nucleotide counts are zero. If they are, it prints the decoded string; otherwise, it prints '===' indicating it's not possible to decode the genome.

This logic ensures that the program works for all valid inputs, including scenarios with an equal number of each type of nucleotide and cases where it’s impossible to achieve this equality due to insufficient question marks. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
