The value of `counts[char]` is incremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`. After incrementing, `counts[char]` will become `target_count`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`counts[char]` is `target_count`, `result[i]` is `char`, `counts` is a non-empty iterable, and the value of `counts[char]` is equal to `target_count`.**
