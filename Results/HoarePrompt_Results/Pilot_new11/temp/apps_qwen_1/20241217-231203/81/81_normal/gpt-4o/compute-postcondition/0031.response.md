Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and \(y\) is divisible by \(x\), \(z = y // x\) and \(z \geq 1\), `count` can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `a = \lfloor \sqrt{z} \rfloor \times x`, `b = z // i * x` and is within the range \([l, r]\), the gcd of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, the product of `a` and `b` divided by their gcd is equal to `y`, if `a = b`, then `count` will be 1, otherwise, `count` will be 2, 3, or remain unchanged, `i = \lfloor \sqrt{z} \rfloor`, `b = z // i * x`***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks whether \(l \leq a \leq r\) and \(l \leq b \leq r\) and \(\text{gcd}(a, b) == x\) and \(\frac{a \cdot b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} == y\).
- If the condition is true, the `count` value can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 depending on the specific logic within the if block, and `a` and `b` maintain their values as specified.
- Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains the same as the if condition, ensuring that all the specified constraints and values of the variables are preserved.
