Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\). `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and `y` is divisible by `x`. `z = y // x` and \(z \geq 1\). `count` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. `a` is \(i_{\text{prev}} + 1\) times `x`. `b = (y // x) // i * x\) and is within the range \([l, r]\). The gcd of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`, and the product of `a` and `b` divided by their gcd is equal to `y`. If `a = b`, then `count` will be 1. Otherwise, `count` will be 2, 3, or remain unchanged after executing the if-else block.***
