Postcondition: **`l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\); `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and \(y\) is divisible by \(x\); `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\) and \(y\) is divisible by \(x\); `z` is \(y // x\) and must be at least 1; `count` is 0; `a` is `i * x` and is currently within the range \([l, r]\); `b` is \((y // x) // i * x\) and is currently within the range \([l, r]\); the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is equal to `x`; the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor is equal to `y`; `a` is equal to `b`.**
