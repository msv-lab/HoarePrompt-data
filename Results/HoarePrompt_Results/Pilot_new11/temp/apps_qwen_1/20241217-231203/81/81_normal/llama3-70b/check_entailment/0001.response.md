Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) respectively. However, the main part of the solution to count the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, and l ≤ a, b ≤ r, is missing.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple case:
- Input: `l = 1`, `r = 6`, `x = 2`, `y = 8`
- Expected Output: `1` (the pair (2, 8) satisfies the conditions)

However, the provided program does not contain any logic to check for good pairs within the given range, compute the number of such pairs, or even utilize the GCD and LCM calculations effectively to solve the problem.

Since the program lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described, it cannot be considered correct. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
