The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` satisfies \(1 \leq \text{GCD}(a, b) \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the function returns `a` which is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` becomes 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, compute their GCD, and return `a` (the GCD) and set `b` to 0.
