Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop, `a` contains the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This function does not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is zero; in such cases, the loop will terminate immediately, and `a` will be returned as the non-zero value. If both `a` and `b` are zero, the function will not enter the loop and will return 0, setting `b` to 0.**

This summary includes the actual functionality of the function based on the code, along with the potential edge cases where either `a` or `b` is zero, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the function's behavior.
