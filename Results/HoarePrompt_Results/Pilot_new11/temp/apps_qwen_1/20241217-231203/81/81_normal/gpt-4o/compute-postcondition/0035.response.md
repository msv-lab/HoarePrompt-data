The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`. All parameters are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= 10^9 and 1 <= x <= y <= 10^9.

- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns `count`, which is the total number of valid pairs (a, b) found during the loop execution, where a and b are within the range [l, r], their GCD is x, and their product divided by their GCD equals y.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integers `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` and return either 0 or the count of valid pairs (a, b) based on the given conditions.
