Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y within the given range [l, r]. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program checks if \( y \% x \neq 0 \), which ensures that a valid pair (a, b) exists. If not, it returns 0, as no pairs satisfy the conditions.

2. **Factorization and Validation**: The program correctly factors \( z = \frac{y}{x} \) and iterates through possible values of \( i \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{z} \). For each factor \( i \), it calculates \( a = i \cdot x \) and \( b = \frac{z}{i} \cdot x \). It then validates these values against the constraints and the conditions for being a good pair.

3. **Duplicate Pairs Handling**: If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, the program counts them once; otherwise, it counts both (a, b) and (b, a) separately.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
