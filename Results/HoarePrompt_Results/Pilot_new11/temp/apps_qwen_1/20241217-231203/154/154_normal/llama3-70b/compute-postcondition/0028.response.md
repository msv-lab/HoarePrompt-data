Postcondition: ***`i` is 46, `k` is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions \((k+1) \times (M+1)\). If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[45]`, `dp[46][j]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[45][j - t[45]] + 1`. Otherwise, the state of `dp[46][j]` remains unchanged.***
