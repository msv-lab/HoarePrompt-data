You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where solving additional subtasks after completing some tasks might yield more points. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum points by considering only the points from completed tasks and the subtasks solved from the remaining time without fully exploring the possibility of solving subtasks from multiple tasks optimally.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 3 10
2 3 5
```

- If Polycarp completes 2 tasks fully, he gets \(2 \times (3 + 1) = 8\) points and spends \(2 \times (2 + 3 + 5) = 16\) minutes, which exceeds the available 10 minutes.
- Instead, Polycarp could complete 1 task fully (3 + 1 = 4 points) and spend 10 minutes solving 2 subtasks from another task (2 out of 3 subtasks, since \(10 - 8 = 2\) minutes are left and each subtask takes 2 minutes). This would give him a total of \(4 + 2 = 6\) points, which is the maximum possible.

The current implementation does not account for this optimal strategy, hence it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and understand what happens during each iteration and after the loop completes.
    #
    #### Initial Analysis
    #
    #- **Variables and Their Constraints:**
    #  - `max_points` starts at 0.
    #  - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
    #  - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
    #  - `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
    #  - `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
    #  - `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.
    #
    #### Loop Execution
    #
    #1. **Outer Loop:**
    #   - The outer loop iterates over `complete_tasks` from 0 to `n`.
    #   - For each `complete_tasks`, it calculates `time_used` as `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
    #   - If `time_used` exceeds `M`, the loop breaks.
    #
    #2. **Inner Loop:**
    #   - The inner loop processes each subtask in the list `t`.
    #   - It calculates `subtasks_solved` and updates `remaining_time`.
    #
    #3. **Update `max_points`:**
    #   - After the inner loop, `subtasks_solved` is adjusted to be the minimum of its current value and \((n - complete_tasks) \cdot k\).
    #   - `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.
    #
    #### Final Values
    #
    #- **After the loop finishes:**
    #  - `max_points` will hold the highest possible value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.
    #  - `n` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `k` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `M` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `t` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `total_time_per_task` remains as it was initially.
    #  - `complete_tasks` will be `n` (the last value it took in the loop).
    #  - `time_used` will be `n * total_time_per_task`.
    #  - `points` will be `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point).
    #  - `remaining_time` will be 0 (since the loop ensures `time_used` does not exceed `M`).
    #  - `subtasks_solved` will be the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop.
    #
    #### Output State
    #
    #The final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed will be:
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #- `max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.
    #- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
    #- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
    #- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
    #- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
    #- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.
    #- `complete_tasks` is `n`.
    #- `time_used` is `n * total_time_per_task`.
    #- `points` is `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point).
    #- `remaining_time` is 0.
    #- `subtasks_solved` is the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop.
    return max_points
    #`max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `complete_tasks` is `n`, `time_used` is `n * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point), `remaining_time` is 0, and `subtasks_solved` is the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop
