Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution. The annotations further clarify that the program initializes the DP table `dp` with dimensions `(k+1) Ã— (M+1)` and fills it appropriately to find the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn. The final step sums up the points from the last row of the DP table and adds the extra points for fully completed tasks, which aligns with the problem requirements. The annotations confirm that the program considers all possible ways to maximize points within the given time limit. Since the original assessment was correct and the annotations support this, the program remains correct according to the problem description.
