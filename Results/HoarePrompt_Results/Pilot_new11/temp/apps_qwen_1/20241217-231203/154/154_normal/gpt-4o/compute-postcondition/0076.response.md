`remaining_time` is decremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. Given the initial state, `remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is increased by 0 (meaning it remains unchanged), and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0. Therefore, `remaining_time` becomes 0 - (0 * subtask_time) = 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is increased by 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is increased by 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0**
