You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string, 'str' has 3 or more characters
```
eturn str
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns string 'str' that has 3 or more characters **


Example2:
Initial State: `numbers` is an empty list, `total` is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `average` is equal to `total / count`
```
return A
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns average whuih is equal to total/count , where total is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list**

Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
return n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the program returns either 4 or 6.
Output State: **The program returns 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is 1, `y` is  greater than 3 , `z` is 0
```
retrun y+x
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
`y' is 0 and 'x' is one so the program returns  0+1=1.
Output State: **`The program returns y that is greater than 3 plus 1**

Example4:
Initial State: `count' contains the number of numbers greater than 1 in the list `numbers`, 'numbers' is a list of integers, 'total' is 0
```
retrun count
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
Output State: **`The program returns the number of integers greater than 1 in list 'numbers' **


Your Task:
Initial State: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and understand what happens during each iteration and after the loop completes.

### Initial Analysis

- **Variables and Their Constraints:**
  - `max_points` starts at 0.
  - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
  - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
  - `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
  - `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
  - `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.

### Loop Execution

1. **Outer Loop:**
   - The outer loop iterates over `complete_tasks` from 0 to `n`.
   - For each `complete_tasks`, it calculates `time_used` as `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
   - If `time_used` exceeds `M`, the loop breaks.

2. **Inner Loop:**
   - The inner loop processes each subtask in the list `t`.
   - It calculates `subtasks_solved` and updates `remaining_time`.

3. **Update `max_points`:**
   - After the inner loop, `subtasks_solved` is adjusted to be the minimum of its current value and \((n - complete_tasks) \cdot k\).
   - `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points + subtasks_solved`.

### Final Values

- **After the loop finishes:**
  - `max_points` will hold the highest possible value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.
  - `n` remains as it was initially.
  - `k` remains as it was initially.
  - `M` remains as it was initially.
  - `t` remains as it was initially.
  - `total_time_per_task` remains as it was initially.
  - `complete_tasks` will be `n` (the last value it took in the loop).
  - `time_used` will be `n * total_time_per_task`.
  - `points` will be `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point).
  - `remaining_time` will be 0 (since the loop ensures `time_used` does not exceed `M`).
  - `subtasks_solved` will be the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop.

### Output State

The final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed will be:

**Output State:**
- `max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\).
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\).
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\).
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`.
- `complete_tasks` is `n`.
- `time_used` is `n * total_time_per_task`.
- `points` is `n * (k + 1)` (if the loop did not break before this point).
- `remaining_time` is 0.
- `subtasks_solved` is the maximum value calculated across all iterations of the inner loop.
```
return max_points

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate what the program returns. Any variable or value that is included in the return, describe all the information we have for it.
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
