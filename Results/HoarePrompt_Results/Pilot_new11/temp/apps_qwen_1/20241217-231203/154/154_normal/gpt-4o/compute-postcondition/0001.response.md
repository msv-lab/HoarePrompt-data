The line of code `max_points = 0` initializes the variable `max_points` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, or `total_time_per_task`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `max_points` and retains the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`max_points` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k positive integers where each element t_j satisfies 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`**
