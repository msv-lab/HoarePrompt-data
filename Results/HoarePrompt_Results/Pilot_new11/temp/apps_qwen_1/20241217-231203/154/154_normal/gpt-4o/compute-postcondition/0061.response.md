`subtasks_solved` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `max_points` is the maximum of its current value and `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`.
