The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but indicates the exit from a loop or conditional block. Given the initial state, the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block we were in.

Output State: **`t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `subtasks_solved` is 1, `remaining_time` must be non-zero (greater than or equal to the smallest element in `t`), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `max_points` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `points`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
