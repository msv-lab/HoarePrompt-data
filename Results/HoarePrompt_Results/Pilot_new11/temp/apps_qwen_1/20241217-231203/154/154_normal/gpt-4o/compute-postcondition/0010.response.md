To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements for the `for` loop to run based on the given code snippet:

1. The loop iterates over each element in the list `t`.
2. Each element in `t` is denoted as `subtask_time`.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- The list `t` must have at least one element, meaning `k` must be at least 1.

Given the initial states:
- `max_points` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\)
- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\)
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\)
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`
- `time_used` is greater than `M`
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`
- `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`
- `subtasks_solved` is 0

The key point is that the list `t` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `k` is at least 1.

State: **`max_points` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 45\), `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 45\) (and specifically, `k` must be at least 1), `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` positive integers where each element `t_j` satisfies \(1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000\), `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`, `time_used` is greater than `M`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)\), `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0**
