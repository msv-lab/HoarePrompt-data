Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It uses a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn by spending `j` minutes on the first `i` subtasks. The program iterates over the subtasks and updates the DP table accordingly. After filling the DP table, it calculates the total points by summing up the points from the last row of the DP table and adding the extra points for fully completed tasks. This approach ensures that the program considers all possible ways to maximize the points within the given time limit, adhering to the problem description. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, no counterexample was found where the program fails to produce the correct output.
