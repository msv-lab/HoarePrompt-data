Postcondition: **`t` has at least one element, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `remaining_time` is 0. If `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Otherwise, no change is made to `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.**
