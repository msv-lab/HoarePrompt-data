Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of tasks), `k` (a positive integer representing the number of subtasks per task), `M` (a non-negative integer representing the maximum available time), and `t` (a list of `k` positive integers representing the time required for each subtask). The function calculates the maximum possible points that can be earned by completing a certain number of tasks within the given time constraint. Points are earned based on the number of tasks completed and the number of subtasks solved within the remaining time. The function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum value of the sum of points and subtasks solved achieved across all iterations of the outer loop.**

**The function iterates over the number of tasks from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to determine the optimal number of tasks to complete within the given time limit `M`. For each task count, it calculates the total time used and checks if it exceeds the available time. If it does, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it calculates the points based on the number of tasks completed and the number of subtasks solved. The function ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the available time and adjusts it accordingly. It then updates `max_points` with the maximum value of the sum of points and subtasks solved found so far. Finally, the function returns `max_points`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function handles the case where `time_used` exceeds `M` by breaking out of the loop.
- The function correctly adjusts the number of subtasks solved based on the remaining time.
- The function ensures that the number of subtasks solved does not exceed the theoretical maximum of `(n - complete_tasks) * k`.

No additional edge cases or missing functionality were identified in the provided code.
