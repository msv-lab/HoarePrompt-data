The code `total_time_per_task = sum(t)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `t` and assigns the result to the variable `total_time_per_task`. This affects the value of `total_time_per_task` but does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `M`, or the contents of the list `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k positive integers where each element t_j satisfies 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in list `t`**
