`subtasks_solved` is incremented by the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is determined by `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Since `t` must have at least one element, its value remains unchanged. The output state is: `t` must have at least one element; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`.

Output State: **`t` must have at least one element; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`; `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`**
