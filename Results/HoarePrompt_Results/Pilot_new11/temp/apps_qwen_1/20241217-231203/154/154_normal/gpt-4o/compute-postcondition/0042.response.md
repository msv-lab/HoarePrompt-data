Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `t` must have at least one element.
   - `remaining_time` is decreased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, where `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`.
   - `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute again:**
   - The loop iterates over each `subtask_time` in `t`.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since we are moving to the next iteration, `t` must still have at least one element.
   - The `remaining_time` is already updated based on the previous iteration, and we don't need to change it since it's derived from the loop's condition.
   - `subtasks_solved` will be incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task` in the next iteration, but we don't need to change this value either since it's derived from the loop's condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` must still have at least one element.

State: **`t` must have at least one element**
