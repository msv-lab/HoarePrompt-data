Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45
   - `M` must be at least 1
   - `t` is a sorted list of integers
   - `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k+1) x (M+1)`
     - `dp[1][j]` is 1 for all `j` such that `1 ≤ j ≤ M` and `j >= t[0]` if `j >= t[i-1]`
     - All other elements of `dp` are 0

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, M + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs over the range `1` to `M` inclusive, so it will run as long as `j` is within this range.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been some value between `1` and `M`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` should now be `2`.

5. **Maintaining Other States:**
   - `i` remains unchanged as the loop is iterating over `j`.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `M` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `dp` remains unchanged as no new values are being computed for `dp` outside the loop condition.

Based on the above analysis, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` must be at least 1, `t` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(k+1) x (M+1)` where `dp[1][j]` is 1 for all `j` such that `1 ≤ j ≤ M` and `j >= t[0]` if `j >= t[0]`, and all other elements of `dp` are 0, `j` is 2**.
