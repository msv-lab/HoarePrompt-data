The code splits the input into two parts, `name` and `type_`, and assigns them to the respective variables. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0 and `files` is a list containing tuples `(name, int(type_))`. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `files` remain unchanged, but now `name` and `type_` have the values split from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `files` is a list containing tuples `(name, int(type_))`, `name` is a string from the input, `type_` is an integer from the input.**
