`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial condition is that `temp_counter` must be in `files_set` and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. After incrementing `temp_counter` by 1, it will still be in `files_set` and will still be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is in `files_set` and `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `temp_counter` is increased by 1**
