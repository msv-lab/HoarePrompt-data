According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `script`. For the loop to execute, `script` must be a non-empty iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) because the loop iterates over each element in `script`.

At the start of the loop, the length of `script` is printed. This means that `script` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `script` has at least one element.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- The length of `script` is printed, which means `script` must be a non-empty iterable.
- To ensure the loop can execute, `script` must have at least one element.

So, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

State: **`script` must be a non-empty iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) containing at least one element**.
