`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `temp_counter` is less than or equal to 2 * n, and `i` is 2. After incrementing, the value of `temp_counter` becomes `temp_counter + 1`. The state of `i` and the content of `moves` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, and `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'**
