Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 3`
   - `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'
   - If `examples[1]` is not equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `temp_counter` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range of `len(examples)`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, we need to determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

4. **Checking the Condition for Incrementing `temp_counter`:**
   - The condition checks if `examples[1]` (which is a string) is not equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`.
   - If the condition is true, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.
   - If the condition is false, `temp_counter` remains unchanged.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - We need to check the value of `examples[1]` and compare it with the string representation of `temp_counter`.
   - If `examples[1]` is not equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`, then `temp_counter` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `examples[1]` is equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`, then `temp_counter` remains unchanged.

Given that the current state is:
- `i` is 1
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 3`
- `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2
- `temp_counter` will either be `2 * n + 3` (if `examples[1]` is equal to the string representation of `2 * n + 3`) or `2 * n + 4` (if `examples[1]` is not equal to the string representation of `2 * n + 3`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 2
- `temp_counter` is either `2 * n + 3` or `2 * n + 4`
- `moves` will still contain the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'

The final state for the next iteration is:
**`i` is 2, `temp_counter` is either `2 * n + 3` or `2 * n + 4`, and `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'**
