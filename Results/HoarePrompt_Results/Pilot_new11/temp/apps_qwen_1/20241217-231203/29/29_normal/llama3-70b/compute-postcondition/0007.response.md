`files` is a list containing tuples, and each tuple consists of `name` and `int(type_)`. The code appends a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the `files` list. The values of `n` and `files` are updated as follows:

- `n` is updated to `n - 1`.
- `files` now includes the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is `n - 1`; `files` is a list containing tuples `(name, int(type_))` and the newly added tuple `(name, int(type_))`**
