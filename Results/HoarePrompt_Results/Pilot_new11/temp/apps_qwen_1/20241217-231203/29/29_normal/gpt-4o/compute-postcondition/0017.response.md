The code appends the value of `name` to the list `regulars`. Given that `name` is updated to "new_name", the list `regulars` will now contain "new_name". The values of `name` and `type_` are updated as described, and the lists `files`, `examples`, and `regulars` retain their other elements from the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`name` is "new_name", `type_` is "1", `files` is a list of strings with at least two files, `examples` is a list containing "example", `regulars` is a list containing "example" and "new_name".**
