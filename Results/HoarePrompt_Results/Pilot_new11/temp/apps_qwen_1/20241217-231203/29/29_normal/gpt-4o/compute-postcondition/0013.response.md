Postcondition: ***`name` is "example", `type_` is "1", `files` is a list of strings with at least one file (reduced by one), `examples` is a list containing "example", `regulars` is either an empty list or contains "example".***

Explanation: 
- In the if part, the state of the variables changes such that `examples` becomes a list containing "example".
- In the else part, the state of the variables does not change regarding `examples` other than ensuring it is either empty or contains "example".
- Since the else part does not alter the value of `examples` further when it already contains "example", the overall postcondition remains consistent with the if part's state.
