Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive.
   - `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least two elements.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `file` is the second element in `examples`.
   - `script` is a list containing the strings `'move {file} {i}'` and `f'move {file} 2'`.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Enumerate Function**:
   - The `enumerate` function starts the index from 1.
   - After the first iteration, `i` would be 2, and `file` would be the second element in `examples`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `file` is the second element in `examples`.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` must be increased by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 3.
   - Since `enumerate` starts from 1, the next element in `examples` would be the third element.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - `file` should now be the third element in `examples`.

7. **Maintaining Other States**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `examples` remains the same since we are only advancing the index.
   - `script` does not change because it contains hardcoded strings based on the current values of `file` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive, `examples` is a list of strings that must have at least two elements, `i` is 3, `file` is the third element in `examples`, and `script` is a list containing the strings `'move {file} {i}'` and `f'move {file} 2'`**.
