Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`.
   - If `examples[0]` is not `str(1)`, then:
     - `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`.
     - `moves` contains the strings `'move <value_of_examples[0]> 2 * n + 1'` and `'move {examples[0]} 1'`.

2. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i < len(examples)`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0 (since it starts from 0 and we're at the first iteration).
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`.
   - We need to consider the condition based on `examples[0]`:
     - If `examples[0]` is not `str(1)`, then `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set` and `moves` contains specific strings.
     - If `examples[0]` is `str(1)`, then `i` and `temp_counter` remain unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `1`.
   - The value of `temp_counter` remains `2 * n + 2` because there was no change in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(examples)`. 

5. **Condition Check for Next Iteration**:
   - If `examples[0]` is not `str(1)`, the conditions for `str(2 * n)` in `files_set` and the contents of `moves` still hold.
   - If `examples[0]` is `str(1)`, `i` and `temp_counter` remain unchanged, but the loop will still proceed to the next element in `examples`.

6. **Updated States for Next Iteration**:
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `temp_counter` remains `2 * n + 2`.
   - The condition for `examples[0]` needs to be checked again.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`**.

If `examples[0]` was `str(1)` in the previous iteration, then the condition check will be the same for the next iteration. If `examples[0]` was not `str(1)`, then the conditions regarding `str(2 * n)` in `files_set` and the contents of `moves` will still hold true.
