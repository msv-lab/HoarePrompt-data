Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the output state after all iterations have executed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2
- `temp_counter` is \(2 \times n + 3\)
- `moves` contains the string `'move {examples[1]} 2'`
- The loop condition is `while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:`

### Loop Analysis:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `temp_counter` is \(2 \times n + 3\)
   - Check the condition: \(2 \times n + 3 \leq 2 \times n\) and `str(2 * n + 3)` must be in `files_set`
   - Since \(2 \times n + 3 > 2 \times n\), the loop will not execute on the first iteration.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - Increment `i` by 1, so `i` is now 3
   - `temp_counter` remains \(2 \times n + 3\)
   - Check the condition: \(2 \times n + 3 \leq 2 \times n\) and `str(2 * n + 3)` must be in `files_set`
   - Since \(2 \times n + 3 > 2 \times n\), the loop will not execute on the second iteration.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - Increment `i` by 1, so `i` is now 4
   - `temp_counter` remains \(2 \times n + 3\)
   - Check the condition: \(2 \times n + 3 \leq 2 \times n\) and `str(2 * n + 3)` must be in `files_set`
   - Since \(2 \times n + 3 > 2 \times n\), the loop will not execute on the third iteration.

4. **General Iteration:**
   - This pattern continues until the condition \(2 \times n + k \leq 2 \times n\) fails for some \(k\).
   - The loop will continue to increment `temp_counter` by 1 until `temp_counter` exceeds \(2 \times n\).

### Final State After All Iterations:
- `i` will be incremented by the number of iterations, which is determined by the number of times `temp_counter` exceeds \(2 \times n\).
- `temp_counter` will be the smallest value greater than \(2 \times n\) that is not in `files_set`.
- `moves` will still contain the string `'move {examples[1]} 2'`.

### Output State:
Since the loop will continue to increment `temp_counter` until it exceeds \(2 \times n\), the final value of `temp_counter` will be the smallest value greater than \(2 \times n\) that is not in `files_set`. The value of `i` will be incremented by the number of times the loop executes.

**Output State:**
**`i` is the initial value of `i` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `temp_counter` is the smallest value greater than `2 * n` that is not in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the string `'move {examples[1]} 2'`**
