To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop and the current state:

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
- `i` is `len(examples) + 1`
- `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` and is still less than `2 * n + 1`
- `temp_counter` is in `files_set`
- `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index
- `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`
- `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`

For the loop to continue executing one more time, both conditions inside the `while` loop must be true at the beginning of the next iteration:
1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

Given the current state:
- `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` and is still less than `2 * n + 1`, so `temp_counter` is less than `2 * n` (since `temp_counter + 1 < 2 * n + 1` implies `temp_counter < 2 * n`).
- `temp_counter` is already in `files_set`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `temp_counter` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Since `temp_counter` is already in `files_set`, no adjustment is needed for this condition.

The only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.

So, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`i` is `len(examples) + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `temp_counter` is in `files_set`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index, `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[i]} {target}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is `2 * len(examples) + 2`**
