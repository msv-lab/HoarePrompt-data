Postcondition: **`i` is 7, `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` + 1, `examples` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {regulars[7]} {temp_counter}'`, `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1, `target` is 18, `regulars[7]` is `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and the current value of `temp_counter` is updated to the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` since `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`**
