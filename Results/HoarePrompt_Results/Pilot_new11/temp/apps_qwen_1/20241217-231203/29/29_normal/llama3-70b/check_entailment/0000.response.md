Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where there are no example tests. In such a case, the program would incorrectly move regular tests into the positions intended for examples, violating the requirement that all examples should come before any regular tests.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4
abc 0
def 0
ghi 1
jkl 0
```

The expected output should be:

```
4
move ghi 1
move abc 4
move def 3
move jkl 2
```

However, the provided program sorts the files by the `type_` value in descending order, which means it will move all regular tests (with `type_ == 0`) to the end, regardless of the initial order. This results in the examples being moved to the wrong positions. Specifically, the example file `ghi` should be moved to position 1, but instead, it gets moved to a later position because all regular tests are moved first.

To fix this, the program needs to sort the files in a way that ensures examples come before regular tests, regardless of their initial order. One way to achieve this is by sorting the files based on their type and then by their names. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    files = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (name, type_) = input().split()
        files.append((name, int(type_), name))  # Append the name to sort by name if types are the same
    
    files.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[2]))  # Sort by type and then by name
    
    examples = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 1]
    regular = [file[0] for file in files if file[1] == 0]
    
    script = []
    for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
        script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
    
    print(len(script))
    for line in script:
        print(line)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the examples are sorted and moved to the correct positions before the regular tests, satisfying the problem requirements.
