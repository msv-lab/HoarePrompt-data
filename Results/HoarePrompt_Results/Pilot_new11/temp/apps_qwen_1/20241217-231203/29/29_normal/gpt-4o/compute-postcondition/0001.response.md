The code `regulars = []` creates an empty list named `regulars`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `files`, or `examples`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `regulars` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is a list of strings where each string represents a file with its name and type separated by a space, and the type is either "1" for an example test or "0" for a regular test; `examples` is an empty list; `regulars` is an empty list.**
