Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(examples)`, `temp_counter` is at most `2 * n + len(examples)`, `examples` is a list where each element is equal to its index (i.e., `str(index + 1)`), `moves` is a list containing the move operations required to achieve the correct order.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization and Loop Structure**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `examples` list.
   - For each element, it checks if the current file name in `examples` matches its expected position (i.e., `str(i + 1)`).
   - If the file name does not match, it tries to find a free position in the `files` list (`temp_counter`) to move the file to.
   - After moving the file, it updates the `examples` list and increments `temp_counter`.

2. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop continues until all elements in `examples` are correctly positioned (i.e., `examples[i] == str(i + 1)` for all `i`).

3. **Final State**:
   - Once the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `examples` because the loop increments `i` for each iteration.
   - `temp_counter` will be at most `2 * n + len(examples)` because it starts at `n + 1` and can increment up to `2 * n` for each mismatched file name in `examples`.
   - `examples` will be a list where each element is equal to its index, i.e., `examples[i] == str(i + 1)` for all `i`.
   - `moves` will contain the sequence of move operations required to reorder the files as described by the loop.

4. **Case Where the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If the loop does not execute at all, this would imply that all elements in `examples` are already in the correct order, so `i` would still be 0, and `temp_counter` would be `n + 1`. However, since we know the loop must execute at least once to change the state, this scenario is not possible based on the provided information.
