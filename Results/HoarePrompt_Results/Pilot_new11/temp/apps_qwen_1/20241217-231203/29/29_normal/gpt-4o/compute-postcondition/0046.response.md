The code snippet `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. However, the initial state does not provide the current value of `moves` or the value of `examples`. The only variables affected by the code are `moves` and `i`. Since `i` is set to 1 and `temp_counter` is defined based on `files_set` and `n`, the output state includes these changes.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `temp_counter` is the maximum value among all elements in `files_set` that are less than or equal to 2 * n

After executing the code:
- A string `f'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}'` is appended to `moves`.

Since the exact value of `examples` and `moves` is not specified, we can only describe the action taken on `moves`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `temp_counter` is the maximum value among all elements in `files_set` that are less than or equal to 2 * n; `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} {temp_counter}'**
