The code sets `target` to the sum of `len(examples)`, `i`, and 1. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 8
- `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` + 1
- `examples` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, so `len(examples)` is 8
- `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} 18'`
- `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `target` is 18

Since `i` is 8 and `len(examples)` is 8, the new value of `target` is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{target} = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \]

The value of `temp_counter` remains unchanged because the assignment does not affect it. All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 8; `temp_counter` is the smallest value such that `temp_counter > 2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set` + 1; `examples` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`; `moves` includes the move operation `f'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} 18'`; `len(regulars)` must be greater than or equal to 1; `target` is 17**
