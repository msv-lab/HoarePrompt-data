The code creates a new list `regular` which contains the `name` values from the tuples in `files` where the `type_` is 0. This means that `regular` is a subset of `examples` but only includes names where the corresponding `type_` is 0.

- The original `files` list is sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value, so this sorting is preserved.
- The original `examples` list remains unchanged as it only contains names where the `type_` is 1.
- The new list `regular` is created with names where the `type_` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 inclusive; `files` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value; `examples` is a list of strings which are the `name` values from the tuples in `files` where the `type_` is 1; `regular` is a list of `name` values from the tuples in `files` where the `type_` is 0.**
