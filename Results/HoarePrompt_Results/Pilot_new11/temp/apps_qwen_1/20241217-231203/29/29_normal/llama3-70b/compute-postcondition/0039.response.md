Functionality: **The function processes a list of filenames and their types, sorting them based on their type, and generates a series of commands to move the example test files first, followed by the regular test files. After processing, it prints the total number of move commands and the commands themselves. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of filenames and their types.
- It then reads `n` pairs of strings and integers, storing them as tuples in a list called `files`. Each tuple contains a filename and its type (`1` for example test and `0` for regular test).
- The `files` list is sorted in descending order based on the type of the files.
- Example test files are extracted and their filenames are stored in the `examples` list, while regular test files are stored in the `regular` list.
- A script is generated to move each example test file, starting from position `n` and decrementing down to position `1`.
- For each regular test file, a move command is added to the script, starting from the next available position after the last example test file.
- Finally, the total number of move commands is printed, followed by each command in the script.

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles the case where there are no example test files (`examples` list is empty), and it will still generate move commands for the regular test files.
- The function also handles the case where there are no regular test files (`regular` list is empty), and it will only generate move commands for the example test files.
- There is no explicit handling for invalid input formats (e.g., filenames not being strings, types not being `1` or `0`). The function assumes valid input based on the problem constraints.

In summary, the function processes the filenames and their types, generates a sequence of move commands, and prints the total number of commands along with the commands themselves.
