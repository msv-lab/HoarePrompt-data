Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`.
  - `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`.
   - `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     - `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
     - `str(temp_counter) in files_set`

3. **First Condition (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`)**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `2 * n + 1` is not less than or equal to `2 * n`. This means the first condition is false.

4. **Second Condition (`str(temp_counter) in files_set`)**:
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, which is in `files_set`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the first condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` is false, the loop will not execute another iteration based on the current state.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the first condition becomes true. Specifically, we need to set `temp_counter` to a value that satisfies `temp_counter <= 2 * n`.

### New State:

- To make the loop execute one more time, `temp_counter` should be set to a value less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- Additionally, `temp_counter` must still be in `files_set`.

Therefore, the new state should be:
State: **`temp_counter` must be in `files_set` and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`**
