The code `moves.append(f'move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}')` appends a formatted string to the list `moves`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `examples[i]` is a specific element from the list `examples`. Since `i` is 0, `examples[0]` is used.
2. `temp_counter` is calculated as `2 * n + 1`. From the initial state, `n` is not specified, but it is used in the calculation of `temp_counter`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 0
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`
- `examples[0]` is not equal to `str(0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `str(1)`
- `str(2 * n)` must be in `files_set`

After the code runs:
- `i` remains unchanged at 0.
- `temp_counter` remains `2 * n + 1`.
- `examples[0]` remains the same because no assignment to `examples[0]` occurs.

Therefore, the updated `moves` list contains the string `'move <value_of_examples[0]> 2 * n + 1'`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `examples[0]` is not equal to `str(1)`, `str(2 * n)` must be in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the string `'move <value_of_examples[0]> 2 * n + 1'`**
