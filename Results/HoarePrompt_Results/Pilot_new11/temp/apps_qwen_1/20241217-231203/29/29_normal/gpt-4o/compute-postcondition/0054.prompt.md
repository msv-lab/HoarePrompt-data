You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state right before the loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one time, please simply repeat the program state right before the loop. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer. `n` beinng an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, students is 2 less than its initial value, So for the loop to  executed the first time time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State right before the while loop: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 3`
   - `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'
   - If `examples[1]` is not equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `temp_counter` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range of `len(examples)`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, we need to determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

4. **Checking the Condition for Incrementing `temp_counter`:**
   - The condition checks if `examples[1]` (which is a string) is not equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`.
   - If the condition is true, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1.
   - If the condition is false, `temp_counter` remains unchanged.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - We need to check the value of `examples[1]` and compare it with the string representation of `temp_counter`.
   - If `examples[1]` is not equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`, then `temp_counter` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `examples[1]` is equal to the string representation of `temp_counter`, then `temp_counter` remains unchanged.

Given that the current state is:
- `i` is 1
- `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 3`
- `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2
- `temp_counter` will either be `2 * n + 3` (if `examples[1]` is equal to the string representation of `2 * n + 3`) or `2 * n + 4` (if `examples[1]` is not equal to the string representation of `2 * n + 3`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 2
- `temp_counter` is either `2 * n + 3` or `2 * n + 4`
- `moves` will still contain the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'

The final state for the next iteration is:
**`i` is 2, `temp_counter` is either `2 * n + 3` or `2 * n + 4`, and `moves` contains the string 'move {examples[1]} 2'**
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
