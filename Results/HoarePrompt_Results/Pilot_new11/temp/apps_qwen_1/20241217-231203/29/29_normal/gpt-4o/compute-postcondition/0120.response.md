The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of files, and `files`, which is a list of strings where each string represents a file with its name and type separated by a space, and the type is either "1" for an example test or "0" for a regular test. After executing the function body, the function returns `moves`, which is the value it held prior to executing the return statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of strings `files`, and return a value stored in `moves`.
