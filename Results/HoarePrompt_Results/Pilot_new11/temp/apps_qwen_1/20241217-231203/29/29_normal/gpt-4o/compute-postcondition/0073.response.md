`temp_counter` is initially 2 * n, which means its value is determined by `2 * n`. The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `temp_counter` will be `2 * n + 1`. The precondition that `temp_counter` must be in `files_set` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `2 * n + 1`, `temp_counter` must be in `files_set`**
