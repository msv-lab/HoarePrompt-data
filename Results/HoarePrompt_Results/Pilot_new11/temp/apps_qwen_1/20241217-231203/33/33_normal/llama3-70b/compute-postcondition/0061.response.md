The code `print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')` checks if `curr_lat` is 90. If it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. However, this code does not modify any of the variables listed in the initial state. It only checks the condition and prints the result.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t_i` ≤ 10^6 for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ `n`), `dir_i` is a string representing the direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"), `curr_lat` is the final latitude after all valid directions are applied, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]. The printed output is either 'YES' if `curr_lat` is 90, or 'NO' if `curr_lat` is not 90.**
