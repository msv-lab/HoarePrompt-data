The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console and does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is in the printed output, but since we are focusing on the state of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is either 90 + `t` / 111.195 if `dir` is 'North', or 90 - `t` / 111.195 if `dir` is 'South', or 90 if `dir` is not 'North', and the printed output is 'NO'**
