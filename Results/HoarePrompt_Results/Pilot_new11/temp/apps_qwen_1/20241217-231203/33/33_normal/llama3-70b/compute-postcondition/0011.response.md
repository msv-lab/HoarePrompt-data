The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop present in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer (converted from the original string `t`), `dir` is a string from the input split by space, and `dir` is not equal to 'South'**
