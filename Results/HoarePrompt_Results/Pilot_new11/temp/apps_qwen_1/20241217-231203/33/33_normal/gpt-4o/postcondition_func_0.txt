The function processes a series of movements in a 20000-unit long corridor, starting from a position of 0. It reads `n` movements where each movement consists of a distance `t` and a direction (`North`, `South`, `West`, `East`). The function checks if each movement is within valid limits and updates the position accordingly. If any movement causes the position to go out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than 20000), or if the position ends up not being 0 after all movements, the function sets the `valid` flag to `False`. If the `valid` flag remains `True` after processing all movements and the final position is 0, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Potential edge cases include positions going out of bounds during any movement, and the final position not being 0.
