Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the direction specified by `dir` (unless `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North'), `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, and `dir` is the second value from input split by a space. If `curr_lat` equals 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the program prints 'NO' to the console and terminates. Otherwise, the program continues without printing anything.***
