`t` and `dir` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The input can be any string that is split into two parts, which are then assigned to `t` and `dir` respectively. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `curr_lat` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` remains unchanged, `t` is a part of the input string, `dir` is another part of the input string**
