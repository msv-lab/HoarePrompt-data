Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Pole Movements**: The code does not enforce the rule that if Limak is on the North Pole, he can only move to the South, and if he is on the South Pole, he can only move to the North. The code does not check the current position before moving, so Limak could move to the North from the South Pole or to the South from the North Pole, which violates the conditions.

2. **Final Position**: The code checks if the final position is 0 (which corresponds to the North Pole) to ensure the journey ends there. However, the code does not enforce the rules about moving between poles correctly, so the final position check alone is insufficient.

Here is an example demonstrating the issue:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  20000 South
  1000 North
  1000000 West
  ```
- Expected output: "NO"
- Actual output with the provided code: "YES"

In this example, after moving 20000 kilometers South from the North Pole, Limak should be at the South Pole. Moving 1000 kilometers North from the South Pole puts him 19000 kilometers away from the South Pole. Then moving 1000000 kilometers West keeps him on the same latitude but far from the North Pole. Therefore, the journey does not end on the North Pole, and the conditions are not satisfied.

To fix this, the code needs to explicitly check the current position before each move and ensure that Limak moves correctly between the poles.
