Postcondition: ***`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `valid` is False, `t` is an integer. If `dir` is 'North', `position` remains unchanged and `valid` is False. If `dir` is 'South', `position` is updated to `position` + `t`. If `dir` is neither 'North' nor 'South', `position` is set to `t`. In all cases, `n` remains unchanged, `dir` is set to its original value, and `valid` is always False. `t` and `valid` retain their original values unless `position` is set to `t` and meets certain conditions (0 or 20000 with `dir` as 'West' or 'East'), in which case `valid` is set to False.***
