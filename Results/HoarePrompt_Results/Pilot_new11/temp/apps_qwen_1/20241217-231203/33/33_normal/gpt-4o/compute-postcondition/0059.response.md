Postcondition: ***`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is 1 or more, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer. If `position` is less than 0 or greater than 20000, the values of all variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of all variables remain unchanged as well.***
