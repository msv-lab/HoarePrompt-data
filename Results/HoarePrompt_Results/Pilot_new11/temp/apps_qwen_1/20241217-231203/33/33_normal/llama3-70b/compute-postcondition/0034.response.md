The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is updated based on the direction `dir`. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is increased by `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. Otherwise, `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Both `t` and `dir` are as per the initial conditions, where `t` is an integer and `dir` is another part of the input string.**
