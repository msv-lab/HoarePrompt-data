`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t_{i}` and `dir_{i}` for each `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are not affected by this input. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), `t_{i}` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6 and `dir_{i}` is a string representing the direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"); `n` is now an input integer.
