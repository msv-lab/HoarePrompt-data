The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` remains unchanged, `t` is an integer (converted from the original string), `dir` is another part of the input string**
