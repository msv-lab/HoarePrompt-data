The code subtracts `t / 111.195` from `curr_lat`. Since `n` is at least 1 and does not interact with the code, `n` remains unchanged. `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, and `dir` is the second value from input split by a space, which also remain unchanged. After executing the code, `curr_lat` is updated to its previous value minus `t / 111.195`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is its initial value minus `t / 111.195`, `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, `dir` is the second value from input split by a space.**
