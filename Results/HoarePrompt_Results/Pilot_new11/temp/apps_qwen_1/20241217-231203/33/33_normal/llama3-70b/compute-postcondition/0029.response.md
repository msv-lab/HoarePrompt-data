`curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The value of `t` is an integer converted from the original string, but since `t` is an integer and the division is by a constant, the new value of `curr_lat` will be the original value of `curr_lat` plus this specific fraction. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is its original value plus `t / 111.195`, `t` is an integer (converted from the original string), `dir` is another part of the input string**
