Postcondition: ***`position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 (inclusive), `dir` is a string representing a direction ("North", "South", "West", "East"), `n` is 0, `valid` is either True or False based on the condition `position != 0`, and `t` is an integer. If `position` is not 0, `valid` is set to False, and if `position` is 0, the function prints 'NO' and does not change the value of `valid`.***
