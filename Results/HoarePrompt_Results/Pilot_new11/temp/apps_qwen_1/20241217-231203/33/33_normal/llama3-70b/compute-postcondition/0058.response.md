The `exit()` function call causes the program to terminate without further execution of the code. Any variables that were in the initial state remain in their initial state since no new assignments or changes occur after this point.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` is adjusted according to the direction specified by `dir` (unless `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not 'North'), `t` is the integer value of the original string `t`, and `dir` is the second value from input split by a space, the program prints 'NO' to the console and terminates.**
