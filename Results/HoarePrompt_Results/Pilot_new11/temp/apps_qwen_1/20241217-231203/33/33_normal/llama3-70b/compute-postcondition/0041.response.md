The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. This means that no variables are updated or assigned new values. The only information that remains from the initial state is that `n` is at least 1, and `curr_lat` remains within its initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `curr_lat` remains within its initial state**
