The code sets `valid` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `position`, `dir`, `n`, or `t`. Therefore, the only change is that `valid` is now `False`.

Output State: **`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is `n-1`, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer representation of the second word from the input.**
