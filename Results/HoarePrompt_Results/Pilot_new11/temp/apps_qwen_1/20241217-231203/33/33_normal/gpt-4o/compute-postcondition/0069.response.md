The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The parameters `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i` are implied by the problem statement but not listed in the function signature. The function processes `n` integers `t_i` and `n` directions `dir_i`. Based on the given constraints, the function does not return any value directly from the function body but rather processes the input data. However, since the function signature does not include these parameters, we can only describe what the function is expected to process.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes `n` integers `t_i` and `n` directions `dir_i`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`, `1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6`, and `dir_i` is a string representing a direction ("North", "South", "West", "East").**
