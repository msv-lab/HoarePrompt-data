`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the string `t` to an integer. The value of `t` is now an integer, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an integer (converted from the original string `t`), `dir` is a string from the input split by space.
