`curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. The original value of `curr_lat` is 90, and `t` is an integer converted from the original string `t`. Therefore, the new value of `curr_lat` will be `90 + t / 111.195`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `dir`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `curr_lat` is 90 + t / 111.195, `t` is an integer (converted from the original string `t`), `dir` is a string from the input split by space, and the current value of `dir` is 'North'**
