Postcondition: ***`position` is an integer, `dir` is a string representing a direction, `n` is 1 or more, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer. Since the if condition `position == 0 or position == 20000` does not change the values of any variables and only checks the condition, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
