Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is either prime or not divisible by any integer `i` in the range \([2, \lfloor \sqrt{num} \rfloor + 1]\). If `num` is found to be divisible by any integer `i` in this range during the loop, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function completes and `num` remains unchanged.**
