To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - The postcondition states that `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, i_current + 1]`.
   - If `num % i == 0` holds true for any `i` in the range `[2, i_current + 1]`, the function returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, the function continues to check divisibility.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Current Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 2 up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `num` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, i_current + 1]`.

4. **Next Iteration Considerations**:
   - For the loop to continue, the next value of `i` (which is `i_current + 1`) must be within the range defined by the loop, i.e., `2` to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i_current` will be `i_current + 1`.

Given this analysis, we need to update the state such that the loop condition for the next iteration is satisfied.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `num` remains the same because the function continues checking divisibility if it hasn't returned `False`.
- `i_current` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\), and `num` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, (i_current + 1) + 1]`**.

In simpler terms:
State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\), and `num` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the range `[2, i_current + 2]`**.
