Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to be correct based on the problem description and the output hints. The code aims to find an integer \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number for a given \( n \). The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a number is prime based on the provided output hints. The main loop iterates through possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000, and as soon as it finds an \( m \) for which \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not prime, it prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

Since the problem guarantees that an answer exists and the code correctly implements the logic to find such an \( m \), the program meets the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
