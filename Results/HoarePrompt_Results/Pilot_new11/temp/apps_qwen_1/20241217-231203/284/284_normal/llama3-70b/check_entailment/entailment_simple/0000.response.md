Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to find a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` as input, ensuring it is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop through possible values of m**:
   - The program iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000 (inclusive).
   
3. **Check if the expression n·m + 1 is not a prime number**:
   - For each value of `m`, the program computes `n * m + 1`.
   - It then uses the `func_1` function to check if the computed value is a prime number.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number is prime by iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

4. **Output the smallest m that makes n·m + 1 not a prime number**:
   - As soon as `func_1(n * m + 1)` returns `False`, indicating that `n * m + 1` is not a prime, the program prints `m` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Guaranteed Answer Existence**:
   - The problem statement guarantees that there exists at least one `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for any given `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Therefore, the loop is designed to terminate with a valid `m`.

6. **Range and Constraints**:
   - The program strictly adheres to the constraints: `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000`, ensuring that it will not exceed the allowed range.

7. **Function Implementation**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly identifies prime numbers by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient and accurate method.

Given these points, the program correctly finds and outputs an `m` such that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number for any valid `n` in the specified range. Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
