The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The initial condition is that `(i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x` and the expression evaluates to `False` if `x % i == 0` or `x % (i + 2) == 0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 144, and `i` is such that `(i + 6) * (i + 6) <= x`; the expression evaluates to False if `x % i == 0` or `x % (i + 2) == 0`, otherwise it evaluates to None; `i` is increased by 6.**
