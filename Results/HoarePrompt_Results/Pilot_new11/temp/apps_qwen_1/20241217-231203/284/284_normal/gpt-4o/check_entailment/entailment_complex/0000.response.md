Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program is designed to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis, which states that there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that for each positive integer \( m \), the number \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number. The program aims to find an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, thereby disproving the hypothesis.

Hereâ€™s how the program works:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) from the input.
2. **Loop Through Possible Values of \( m \)**: It iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000.
3. **Prime Check Function**: For each \( m \), it calls a helper function `func_1` to check if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is a prime number.
4. **Output**: If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number, the program prints \( m \) and breaks out of the loop.

### Analysis:

- **Problem Description Requirements**: The program needs to find an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. This aligns with the requirement that the program should find a counterexample.
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` correctly implements a primality test for numbers between 1 and 1000.
  - It handles small numbers (less than or equal to 3) directly.
  - For larger numbers, it checks divisibility by 2 and 3, and then uses a loop to check for other potential divisors up to the square root of \( x \).
  - This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers.

### Example Walkthrough:

1. **Example 1**: Input `n = 3`
   - For \( m = 1 \): \( 3 \cdot 1 + 1 = 4 \)
     - `func_1(4)` returns `False` (4 is not a prime number).
     - The program outputs `1` and stops.
   
2. **Example 2**: Input `n = 4`
   - For \( m = 1 \): \( 4 \cdot 1 + 1 = 5 \)
     - `func_1(5)` returns `True` (5 is a prime number).
   - For \( m = 2 \): \( 4 \cdot 2 + 1 = 9 \)
     - `func_1(9)` returns `False` (9 is not a prime number).
     - The program outputs `2` and stops.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to find a counterexample for any given \( n \). The function `func_1` accurately determines whether a number is prime, and the main loop iterates through possible values of \( m \) until it finds a non-prime result. Therefore, the program is correct.
