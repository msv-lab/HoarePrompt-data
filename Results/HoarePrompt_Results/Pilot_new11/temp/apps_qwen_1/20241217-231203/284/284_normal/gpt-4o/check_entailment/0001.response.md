Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. For any given \( n \), it checks values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and finds the smallest \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether a number is prime. Since the problem guarantees that an answer exists within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \). Thus, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
