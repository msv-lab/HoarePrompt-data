Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not accurately calculate the minimum number of segments needed to draw \( n \) squares.

Let's consider the example where \( n = 4 \). According to the problem description, the optimal way to draw 4 squares involves drawing 4 segments initially (2 vertical and 2 horizontal), and then using these segments as guides to draw the remaining segments. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the minimum number of segments needed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

- For \( n = 4 \):
  - The program iterates over possible values of \( a \) and \( b \).
  - When \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \), it calculates \( 2 * (a + b) = 2 * (2 + 2) = 8 \), which is incorrect.

The correct approach involves recognizing that to draw \( n \) squares, the minimum number of initial segments required is \( n \). Each additional square can be drawn using previously drawn segments as guides.

A corrected version of the program would be:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    # Since each square requires 2 initial segments, and subsequent squares can use previous segments,
    # the minimum number of segments needed is simply n.
    return n
```

This corrected version correctly handles all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the original program is incorrect for certain cases.
