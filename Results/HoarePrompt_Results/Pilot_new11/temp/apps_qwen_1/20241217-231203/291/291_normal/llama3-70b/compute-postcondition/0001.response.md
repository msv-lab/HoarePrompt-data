The code snippet calculates and prints a value based on the bit length of `n`. Let's break down the steps:

1. `n.bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), its bit length ranges from 1 to 30 (because \(2^{29} = 536870912 < 10^9 < 2^{30} = 1073741824\)).
2. The expression `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` calculates twice the number of bits minus 2 and then adds 2. This results in `2 * n.bit_length()`.
3. The value is printed but not stored in any variable.

Since the initial state only specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), and no new variables are defined, the output does not affect the value of `n`. The only change is the printed output, which is `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\); printed value is \(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2\)**
