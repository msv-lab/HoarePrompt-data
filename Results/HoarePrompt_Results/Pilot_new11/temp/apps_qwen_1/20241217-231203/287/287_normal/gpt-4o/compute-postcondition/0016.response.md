According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition `i * i <= num`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 4.
- `count` is either 3 or 4 (this variable does not affect the loop condition).
- `i` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i * i <= num` must be true after incrementing `i`. Initially, `i` is 3, so the condition checks if \(3^2 \leq num\), which simplifies to \(9 \leq num\).

Since `i` will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration, the new condition will check if \(4^2 \leq num\), which simplifies to \(16 \leq num\).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num` must be at least 16.

The state `count` is either 3 or 4 and does not affect the loop condition, so no adjustment is necessary for `count`.

State: **`num` must be at least 16**
