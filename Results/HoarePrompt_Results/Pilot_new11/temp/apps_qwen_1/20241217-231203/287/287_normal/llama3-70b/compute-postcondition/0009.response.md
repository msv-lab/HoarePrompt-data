To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
- **`res` is 1 because there exists an integer `i` such that `n % i == 0` and `i * i == n`.**

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:** The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer â‰¥ 1.
   - `res` is 1, indicating that a divisor `i` was found such that `i * i == n`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` from 1 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is within this range.

2. **Check the End Condition:**
   - If the loop completes all iterations without finding a new valid `i` (where `n % i == 0` and `i * i == n`), then `res` would remain 1.
   - However, since `res` is currently 1, it implies that the loop must have found at least one such `i` in the previous iterations.

3. **Next Iteration Considerations:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, the next value of `i` will be 2 if the current value of `i` is 1.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `i` will increment by 1.
   - The variable `res` remains unchanged unless a new valid `i` is found, but since `res` is already 1, it doesn't change based on the loop execution alone.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `res` is 1 because there exists an integer `i` such that `n % i == 0` and `i * i == n`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

So, the updated state is:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `res` is 1 because there exists an integer `i` such that `n % i == 0` and `i * i == n`, and `i` is 2.**
