Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to calculate the number of divisors of \( n \) within the range \( 1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n} \) and adjusts for perfect squares. However, this approach does not accurately determine the number of different weights of splits of \( n \).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to understand that the number of different weights of splits of \( n \) is essentially the number of distinct values that the weight (the number of elements equal to the first element) can take. This value ranges from 1 to \( n \), inclusive, because for any \( k \) where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), there exists a split of \( n \) with weight \( k \) (e.g., \( [k, 1, 1, ..., 1] \)).

Thus, for any given \( n \), the number of different weights of its splits is \( n \). The provided code does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results for many inputs. For example, for \( n = 7 \), the correct output should be 7, but the code outputs 4. Therefore, the code is incorrect for at least one input case.
