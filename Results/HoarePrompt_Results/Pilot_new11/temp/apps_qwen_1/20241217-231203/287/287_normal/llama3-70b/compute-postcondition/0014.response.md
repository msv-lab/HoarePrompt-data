According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs for `i` values from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- If `n` is 4, `res` is 2.
- If `n` is not 4 and is not even, `res` remains 1.
- If `n` is not 4 and is even, `res` is 1.

The loop will continue if `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

Let's consider the possible cases for `n`:

1. **If `n` is 4:**
   - `res` is 2.
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 2` (since `int(4 ** 0.5) + 1 = 3`).

2. **If `n` is not 4 and is odd:**
   - `res` is 1.
   - The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **If `n` is not 4 and is even:**
   - `res` is 1.
   - The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i` and ensure the condition `i < int(n ** 0.5) + 1` holds true.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the current value of `i`:**
   - Let's assume the loop just finished an iteration where `i` was `k`.
   - The next iteration will start with `i = k + 1`.

2. **Ensure the loop condition is met:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1` and this value should be less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given these points, we need to check if the loop can continue based on the current `n` and adjust the states accordingly.

### Conclusion:

- The value of `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.

### Adjusted States:

- If `n` is 4 and `i` was 2, the next `i` will be 3 and the loop will not continue because `3 >= 3`.
- If `n` is not 4, `res` remains 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `res` remains 1 if `n` is not 4.**

Note: `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we use `k` to represent it.

Thus, the final answer is:

**State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `res` remains 1 if `n` is not 4.**
