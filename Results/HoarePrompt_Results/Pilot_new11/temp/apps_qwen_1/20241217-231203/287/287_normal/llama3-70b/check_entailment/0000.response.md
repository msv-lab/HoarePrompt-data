Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to calculate the number of different weights of splits for a given \( n \). However, it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates the number of divisors of \( n \), which is not equivalent to finding the number of different weights of splits.

To understand why this program is incorrect, consider the following:

- The program iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{n} \) and checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( n \).
- If \( i \) is a divisor, it increments the result by 2 (except when \( i^2 = n \), in which case it decrements by 1).

This logic only counts the number of divisors of \( n \), not the number of different weights of splits. For example, for \( n = 7 \), the correct output should be 4, but the program will incorrectly output 2 because the divisors of 7 are 1 and 7, and there are only two different weights (1 and 7).

A correct approach would involve generating all possible splits and counting the distinct weights, which is more complex than simply counting divisors. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
