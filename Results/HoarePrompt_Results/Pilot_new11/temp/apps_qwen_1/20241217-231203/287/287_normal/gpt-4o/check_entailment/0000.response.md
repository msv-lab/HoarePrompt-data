Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of divisors of `num`, but this approach is incorrect for determining the number of different weights of splits of `n`.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the input `n = 8`. According to the problem description, we need to find the number of different weights of splits of `8`. The valid splits and their weights are as follows:

- Weight 1: `[8]`
- Weight 2: `[4, 4]`, `[3, 3, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2, 2]`
- Weight 3: `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- Weight 4: `[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

Thus, there are 4 different weights (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`).

However, the provided program returns `5`, which is incorrect because it counts the number of divisors of `8` instead of counting the different weights of splits. The program should focus on generating all possible splits and determining their weights, rather than simply counting divisors.

Since the program does not correctly handle the problem description for the given input, the correctness is **False**.
