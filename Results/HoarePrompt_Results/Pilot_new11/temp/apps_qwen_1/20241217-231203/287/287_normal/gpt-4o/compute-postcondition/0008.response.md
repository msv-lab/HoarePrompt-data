Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` (which starts at 1) is a divisor of `num`. Specifically, if `i` is a divisor of `num` and `i` is not equal to `num // i`, `count` is set to 2; otherwise, `count` is set to 1. The variable `i` is incremented after each iteration, but its specific value is not mentioned in the postcondition as it is not relevant to the final state of `count`.***
