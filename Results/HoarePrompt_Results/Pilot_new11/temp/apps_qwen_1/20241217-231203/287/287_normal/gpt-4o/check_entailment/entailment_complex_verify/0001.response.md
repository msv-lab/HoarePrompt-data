Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` is indeed counting the number of divisors of `num`, not the number of different weights of its splits. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of `n`, which is a different task from counting divisors. The annotated version shows that the logic in the function does not match the problem description. Specifically, the function does not generate or process splits of `n` and determine their weights, but rather counts divisors of `num`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem, and the original assessment remains correct.
