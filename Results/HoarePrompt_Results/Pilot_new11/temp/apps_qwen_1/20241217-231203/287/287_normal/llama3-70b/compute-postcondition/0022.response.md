Functionality: **The function calculates the number of divisors of a given integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)), and if \( n \) is a perfect square, it subtracts one from the count. Specifically, for each divisor \( i \) of \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n} \)), it increments the result by 2. If \( i \times i = n \), it decrements the result by 1 to adjust for the double counting of the square root. The function then prints the final count of divisors.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function handles the case where \( n \) is a perfect square correctly by decrementing the result by 1.
- The function correctly counts each divisor only once by considering divisors up to \( \sqrt{n} \) and adjusting for perfect squares.
- The function assumes valid input \( n \) within the specified range \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). However, it does not explicitly handle invalid input such as non-integer or negative values, which would cause the program to raise a `ValueError` or unexpected behavior. To improve robustness, additional input validation could be added.
