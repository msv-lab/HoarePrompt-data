Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The for loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
   ```
   This means that the loop variable `i` will take values from 1 up to (and including) `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 because the range function in Python starts from the first argument (which is 1 in this case).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, the upper bound of the range function (`int(n ** 0.5) + 1`) must be greater than the starting value of `i`, which is 1. Therefore, `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 1, but more importantly, `n` itself must be greater than or equal to 1 since the square root of `n` will be used in the range calculation.

4. **Consider the State Before the Loop Starts**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user and is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
   - `res` is 0.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop condition is met, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

- Since `i` starts at 1, the only variable that directly controls the loop's execution is `n`.
- `res` being 0 does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `res` is 0**
