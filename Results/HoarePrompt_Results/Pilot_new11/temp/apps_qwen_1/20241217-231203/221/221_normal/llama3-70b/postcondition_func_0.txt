The function accepts two integers `s` and `x` where \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\) and \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{12}\). It iterates through all possible values of `a` from 1 to `s-1`, calculates `b` as `s - a`, and checks if the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` equals `x`. It counts the number of pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy both conditions and prints the count. If no such pairs exist, the count will be 0. The function does not return anything; it only prints the count. Potential edge cases include when `s` is very large, which might cause performance issues due to the iteration over a large range.
