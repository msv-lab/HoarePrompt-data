Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum jump ability required to jump only on vowels. Specifically, the logic for calculating `max_jump` is flawed. The current implementation assumes that the jump length is half the distance between consecutive vowels, which is incorrect. 

Consider the input `"ABABBBACFEYUKOTT"`. The correct output should be `4`, because the Grasshopper needs to make jumps of length 4 to cover the gap between the first vowel 'A' and the next vowel 'E'. However, the current implementation would incorrectly calculate the jump length as 3 for the first segment (`A` to `E`) and then 1 for the remaining segments, resulting in a maximum jump of 3 instead of 4.

To fix this, the program should correctly identify the longest gap between consecutive vowels and ensure that the maximum jump is sufficient to cover this gap.
