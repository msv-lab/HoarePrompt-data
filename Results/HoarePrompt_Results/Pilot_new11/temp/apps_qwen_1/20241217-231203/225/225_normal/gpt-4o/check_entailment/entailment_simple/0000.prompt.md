You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of s does not exceed 100. The string contains only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels.
def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum difference between the index of any vowel in `s` and the index of the previous vowel in `s`. If there are no vowels in `s`, `max_jump` remains 1, `prev_pos` is the last index of a vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present in `s`.
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump
    #The program returns max_jump which is the maximum of its current value and the length of s minus the last position of a vowel (len(s) - prev_pos)), where `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, and `prev_pos` is the last index of a vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present in `s`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
