`max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between the current index `i` and the previous position `prev_pos`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0 and `prev_pos` is -1, so `i - prev_pos` equals `0 - (-1)` which is 1. The initial value of `max_jump` is 1, so the new value of `max_jump` is the maximum of 1 and 1, which remains 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, the current value of `s[i]` is in the set `vowels`**
