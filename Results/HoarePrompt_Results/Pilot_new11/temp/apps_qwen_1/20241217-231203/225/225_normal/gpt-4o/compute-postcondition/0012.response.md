Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0)
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
- `max_jump` is 2 if `s[1]` is in the set `vowels`, else `max_jump` is 1
- `prev_pos` is 1 if `s[1]` is in the set `vowels`, otherwise `prev_pos` remains -1

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(s)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(s)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

2. **Calculate the New Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

3. **Check the Conditions for the Set `vowels` and `max_jump`:**
   - We need to check the value of `s[2]` to determine the new values of `max_jump` and `prev_pos`.
   - `max_jump` will be 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, otherwise it will be 1.
   - `prev_pos` will be 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, otherwise it will remain -1.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `s` remains the same (non-empty string).
   - `vowels` remains the same (set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}).
   - `max_jump` and `prev_pos` depend on the value of `s[2]`.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0).
- `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, else `max_jump` is 1.
- `prev_pos` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, otherwise `prev_pos` remains -1.

### Adjusted States:
State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, else `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 2 if `s[2]` is in the set `vowels`, otherwise `prev_pos` remains -1**
