#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of s does not exceed 100. The string contains only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels.
def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum difference between the index of any vowel in `s` and the index of the previous vowel in `s`. If there are no vowels in `s`, `max_jump` remains 1, `prev_pos` is the last index of a vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present in `s`.
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump
    #The program returns max_jump which is the maximum of its current value and the length of s minus the last position of a vowel (len(s) - prev_pos)), where `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, and `prev_pos` is the last index of a vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input, which consists of capital English letters and can contain only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. It calculates and returns the maximum distance between consecutive vowels in the string. If there are no vowels in the string, it returns 1. The function iterates through the string, tracking the positions of vowels and updating the maximum jump distance accordingly. After completing the iteration, it ensures that the maximum jump distance is updated to include the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string if necessary. The final state of the program is such that the variable `max_jump` holds the maximum distance between consecutive vowels or the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string if no consecutive vowels were found.
