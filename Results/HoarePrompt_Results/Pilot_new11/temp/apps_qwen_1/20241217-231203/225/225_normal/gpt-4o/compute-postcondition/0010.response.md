The variable `prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `max_jump`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 2 if `s[1]` is in the set `vowels`, else `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 1**
