Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, containing only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels. It calculates and prints the maximum jump distance between consecutive vowels in the string. A "jump distance" is defined as half the number of characters between two vowels, rounded up. If there are no vowels in the string, the function prints 0. If the last character of the string is a vowel and there is no other vowel before it, the function correctly considers the distance from the start of the string to this vowel.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the string consists of only one vowel, the function calculates the distance from the start to this vowel, which is considered the maximum jump distance.
- If there are no vowels in the string, the function prints 0.
- If the string ends with a vowel and there is no other vowel before it, the function correctly calculates the jump distance from the start of the string to this vowel.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided code correctly handles the scenario where the last character is a vowel and there is no other vowel before it. Therefore, no additional functionality is required.
