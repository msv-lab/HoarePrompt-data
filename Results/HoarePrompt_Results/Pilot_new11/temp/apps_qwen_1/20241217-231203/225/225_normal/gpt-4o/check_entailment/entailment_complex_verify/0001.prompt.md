You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.

Program:

def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump from the beginning of the string to the end, only landing on vowels. The logic in the `func_1` function iterates through the string, tracking the maximum jump length needed between vowels. This approach ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases, as it considers the distance between each pair of consecutive vowels and updates the maximum jump length accordingly. Since there are no edge cases or inputs that this program fails to handle as described, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
s = input()
print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of s does not exceed 100. The string contains only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels.
def func_1(s):
    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}
    max_jump = 1
    prev_pos = -1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
            prev_pos = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `s` is a non-empty string (length > 0), `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum difference between the index of any vowel in `s` and the index of the previous vowel in `s`. If there are no vowels in `s`, `max_jump` remains 1, `prev_pos` is the last index of a vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present in `s`.
    max_jump = max(max_jump, len(s) - prev_pos)
    return max_jump
    #The program returns max_jump which is the maximum of its current value and the length of s minus the last position of a vowel (len(s) - prev_pos)), where `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, and `prev_pos` is the last index of a vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowels are present in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input, which consists of capital English letters and can contain only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. It calculates and returns the maximum distance between consecutive vowels in the string. If there are no vowels in the string, it returns 1. The function iterates through the string, tracking the positions of vowels and updating the maximum jump distance accordingly. After completing the iteration, it ensures that the maximum jump distance is updated to include the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string if necessary. The final state of the program is such that the variable `max_jump` holds the maximum distance between consecutive vowels or the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string if no consecutive vowels were found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
