The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the function signature. However, based on the constraints, it seems the function might internally use a string input that meets the specified criteria. Given the problem statement focuses on the input rather than defining it within the function, we'll describe the functionality based on the provided constraints.

The functionality of the function `func` is to accept a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, containing only the characters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels, and process it accordingly (though the exact processing is not defined in the given information).
