Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
   - `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `max_jump` is either 1 or 0.
   - `last_vowel` is either 0 or -1.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes 1).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` needs to be set to 1.
   - `last_vowel` and `max_jump` remain the same as they were not modified within the loop body in this iteration.

5. **Final State:**
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `vowels` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `max_jump` remains either 1 or 0.
   - `last_vowel` remains either 0 or -1.
   - `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is either 1 or 0, `last_vowel` is either 0 or -1, `i` is 1**.
