Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, Amr follows a specific algorithm to navigate through the perfect binary tree and visits nodes based on the given rules. However, the code provided does not accurately simulate this algorithm.

The code attempts to calculate the number of nodes visited by dividing the node index `n` by 2 and adding a certain value based on whether `n` is even or odd. This approach does not correctly simulate the navigation rules described in the problem statement.

For example, consider the input `2 3`:
- According to the problem description, Amr starts at the root (node 1) and follows the sequence "LRLRLRLRL...". For `n=3`, the path would be: `1 -> 2 (visited) -> 4 (visited) -> 8 (exit)`.
- The code, however, would calculate the number of visited nodes as follows:
  - `n=3`: `ans += 1` (since `3 % 2 == 1`)
  - `n=1`: `ans += 0` (since `1 % 2 == 1`)
- The total number of visited nodes calculated by the code is 1, which is incorrect.

Another example, consider the input `3 6`:
- According to the problem description, the path would be: `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 (visited) -> 10 (exit)`.
- The code would calculate the number of visited nodes as follows:
  - `n=6`: `ans += 2` (since `6 % 2 == 0`)
  - `n=3`: `ans += 1` (since `3 % 2 == 1`)
  - `n=1`: `ans += 0` (since `1 % 2 == 1`)
- The total number of visited nodes calculated by the code is 3, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the provided code does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
