The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Since `n` was initially an integer input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\), the value of `n` is now updated to its half. The variable `h` remains unchanged, and the variable `ans` remains unchanged as well because the code does not affect `ans`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is half of its original value (such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{h-1}\)), and `ans` is updated according to the initial conditions.**
