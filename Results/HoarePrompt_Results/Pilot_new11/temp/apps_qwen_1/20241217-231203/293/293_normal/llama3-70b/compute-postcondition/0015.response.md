The initial state is:
- `h` is an integer input from the user
- `n` is calculated as `h // 4` and must remain greater than 1
- `ans` has been updated according to the initial condition.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans += n // 2 - 1
```

Let's analyze the code step by step:
1. `n = h // 4` and `n > 1` are the initial conditions.
2. `ans += n // 2 - 1` updates `ans` by adding the value of `n // 2 - 1` to the current value of `ans`.

Since `n` is `h // 4` and must be greater than 1, let's consider the value of `n` in terms of `h`:
- `n = h // 4` and `n > 1` implies that `h` must be at least 5 (since `5 // 4 = 1` and `6 // 4 = 1`, so the smallest `h` that satisfies `n > 1` is 5).

Let's assume `h` is 5 (the minimum value satisfying the condition):
- `n = 5 // 4 = 1`
- Since `n` must be greater than 1, we need to ensure `h` is at least 8 (since `8 // 4 = 2`).
- Let's assume `h` is 8:
- `n = 8 // 4 = 2`
- `ans += 2 // 2 - 1 = ans + 0` (since `2 // 2 = 1` and `1 - 1 = 0`)

Now, let's generalize:
- For any valid `h` such that `h // 4 > 1`, the value of `n` is `h // 4`.
- The updated `ans` is `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`.

Since the exact value of `ans` before this operation is not specified, we only update `ans` based on the current `n` value.

Output State: **`h` is an integer input from the user, `n` is `h // 4` and must remain greater than 1, `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2 - 1` to its current value.**
