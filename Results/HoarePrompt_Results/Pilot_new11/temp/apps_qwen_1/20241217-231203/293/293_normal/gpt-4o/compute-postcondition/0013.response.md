Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 1; `path` is a non-empty binary string representing `n - 1` (padded to length `h` with leading zeros); `current_level` is 0; if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is 1; otherwise, `current_node` is 2.***
