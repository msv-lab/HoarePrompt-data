The line `input = sys.stdin.read` does not actually assign a value to any variable. Instead, it reassigns the `input` function to read from standard input as a single string, rather than waiting for separate lines of input. This affects how input is processed in the rest of the code but does not change the values of existing variables.

Therefore, the only change is in the method of handling input, but the initial values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}.`**
