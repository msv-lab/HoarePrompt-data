You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output
5
Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited_count = 0
    path = bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    for direction in path:
        visited_count += 1
        if direction == '0':
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
        else:
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
    print(visited_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the rules for skipping commands and returning to the parent node when a destination node is already visited or when reaching a non-exit leaf node. The program assumes that `n` is the index of the exit node and directly calculates the number of steps based on the binary representation of `n - 1`. This approach does not account for the actual traversal rules and can lead to incorrect results for certain values of `h` and `n`.

For example, consider the input `(h, n) = (2, 3)`. According to the problem description, the traversal path would be "LR", visiting nodes 0 (root), 1 (left child of root), 3 (right child of root). However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of visited nodes as 5, which is not consistent with the described algorithm.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: h is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited_count = 0
    path = bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    for direction in path:
        visited_count += 1
        
        if direction == '0':
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
        else:
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is `h`; `path` is the empty string; `current_node` is \(2^{h-1}\); `current_level` is `h-1`.
    print(visited_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a binary path representation of an integer `n` within the range `[1, 2^h]` and calculates the number of nodes visited while traversing the path. The function takes no explicit parameters and reads `h` and `n` from standard input. It prints the number of nodes visited during the traversal. The function starts by reading two integers `h` and `n` from standard input, where `h` represents the height of a binary tree and `n` is an integer in the range `[1, 2^h]`. It then converts `n-1` into its binary representation, which is used to traverse the tree. For each bit in the binary path (from left to right), the function updates the current node and increments the visit count. If the bit is '0', the function moves to the left child; if the bit is '1', it moves to the right child. The function ensures that the input constraints are respected and handles the edge case where the binary path is fully traversed. After the traversal, the function prints the total number of nodes visited, which equals the height `h` of the tree.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
