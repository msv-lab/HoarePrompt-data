Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 2; `path` must have at least one character left; `direction` is the first character of the remaining `path`; `current_node` is updated based on the value of `direction`; `current_level` is incremented by 1. If `direction` is '0', `current_node` is updated to \(2 \times \text{previous\_value} + 1\). Otherwise, `current_node` is either `4 * n + 4` or `4 * n + 6`.***
