`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `visited_count` is 2, so after incrementing, `visited_count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50; `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\); `visited_count` is 3; `path` must have at least two characters left; `direction` is the second character of the remaining `path`; `current_node` is updated based on the value of `direction`; `current_level` is incremented by 1.**
