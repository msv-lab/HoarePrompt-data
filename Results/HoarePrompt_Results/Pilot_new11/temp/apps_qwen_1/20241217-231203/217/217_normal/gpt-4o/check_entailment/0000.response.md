Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the difference \(B - C\) by summing the positive numbers to \(B\) and the negative numbers to \(C\). This approach ensures that the absolute values of positive numbers contribute positively to \(B - C\), while the absolute values of negative numbers subtract from \(B - C\). The program handles all potential cases correctly, as it processes all elements of the input list and calculates the desired result without any logical errors.
