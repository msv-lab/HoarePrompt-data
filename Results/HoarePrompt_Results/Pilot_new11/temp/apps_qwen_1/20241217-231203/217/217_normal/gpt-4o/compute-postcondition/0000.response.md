The code reads an integer `n` from standard input, which represents the number of elements in the sequence. After reading this integer, `n` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other part of the initial state (the sequence of integers) remains unchanged because the code does not read or process them yet.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from standard input, the sequence of integers has not been read yet.**
