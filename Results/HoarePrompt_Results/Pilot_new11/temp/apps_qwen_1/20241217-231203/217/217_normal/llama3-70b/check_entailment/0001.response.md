Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array in descending order and then partitioning it into two sequences, `b` and `c`, based on the index of each element. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of `B - C`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-1 -2 -3
```

The program will sort the array as `[-1, -2, -3]` and then partition it as follows:
- `b` will contain the elements at even indices: `-1`
- `c` will contain the elements at odd indices: `-2, -3`

Thus, `B = -1` and `C = -5`, leading to `B - C = 4`.

However, the correct partitioning should be:
- `b` could contain all elements: `-1, -2, -3`
- `c` could be an empty sequence

This would result in `B = -6` and `C = 0`, leading to `B - C = -6`, which is the maximum possible value for this case.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and hence, the correctness is **False**.
