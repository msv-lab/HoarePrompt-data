Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly partition the sequence into two parts to maximize \(B - C\). The current approach sorts the array in descending order and alternates between adding to \(b\) and \(c\), which does not necessarily maximize the difference \(B - C\).

For example, consider the input:
```
4
-10 -20 10 20
```

The program would partition the array as follows:
- \(b = [-10, 10]\)
- \(c = [-20, 20]\)

This results in:
- \(B = -10 + 10 = 0\)
- \(C = -20 + 20 = 0\)

Thus, \(B - C = 0\).

However, the optimal partition would be:
- \(b = [-10, 20]\)
- \(c = [-20, 10]\)

This results in:
- \(B = -10 + 20 = 10\)
- \(C = -20 + 10 = -10\)

Thus, \(B - C = 20\), which is greater than 0.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
