Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list of integers `a` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`) and each integer in the list satisfies `-100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`. After sorting the list in descending order, the function calculates the sum of elements at even indices (`b`) and the sum of elements at odd indices (`c`). Finally, it prints the difference between these two sums (`b - c`). The function does not return any value; instead, it only prints the result of `b - c`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the input list `a` might be empty. However, given the constraints `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, this case is not applicable.
- The annotations mention checking for at least one positive integer in the list, but the actual code does not perform this check. Instead, it calculates the difference between the sums of elements at even and odd indices.
- The function prints the result of `b - c` but does not return any value, contrary to the return postconditions provided in the annotation.
