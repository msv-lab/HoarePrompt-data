Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Initial State**: The program reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), and \( 1 \leq t < n + k \).

2. **Case 1: \( t \leq k \)**:
   - In this scenario, the first \( t \) spectators stand up sequentially.
   - Therefore, the number of standing spectators at time \( t \) is simply \( t \).
   - The program prints \( t \), which is correct.

3. **Case 2: \( t > k \) and \( t \leq n \)**:
   - After \( k \) seconds, all \( k \) spectators are standing.
   - From \( t = k + 1 \) to \( t = n \), the \( k \)-th spectator starts sitting down, and the next spectator (i.e., the \((k+1)\)-th spectator) starts standing.
   - Therefore, the number of standing spectators remains \( k \) until \( t = n \).
   - The program prints \( k \), which is correct.

4. **Case 3: \( t > n \) and \( t \leq n + k - 1 \)**:
   - After \( n \) seconds, the last spectator (i.e., the \( n \)-th spectator) is standing.
   - From \( t = n + 1 \) to \( t = n + k - 1 \), each spectator starts sitting down one by one.
   - The number of standing spectators decreases linearly from \( k \) to 1.
   - The program calculates \( n + k - t \) and prints it. For example, at \( t = n + 1 \), the number of standing spectators is \( n + k - (n + 1) = k - 1 \); at \( t = n + 2 \), the number of standing spectators is \( n + k - (n + 2) = k - 2 \), and so on. This matches the problem description.

5. **Special Case: \( t = n + k \)**:
   - At \( t = n + k \), the \( n \)-th spectator is the last one to sit down.
   - The number of standing spectators is 0.
   - The program calculates \( n + k - t \) and prints it, which is correct since \( n + k - (n + k) = 0 \).

Given these cases, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all possible values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \). Therefore, the program is correct.
