Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to correctly compute the number of standing spectators for times greater than \( n \) but less than or equal to \( n + k \). According to the problem description:

- For \( t \leq k \), the number of standing spectators is \( t \).
- For \( k < t \leq n \), the number of standing spectators is \( k \).
- For \( t > n \), the number of standing spectators is \( n + k - t \).

However, the code only correctly handles the first two cases. In the third case, the code incorrectly prints \( n + k - t \), which should be \( n - (t - n - k) \mod k \). This is because after time \( n \), the spectators' positions repeat every \( k \) units. Therefore, the number of standing spectators at time \( t \) is \( n - (t - n - k) \mod k \) when \( t > n \).

To illustrate, consider the test case \( n = 10 \), \( k = 5 \), and \( t = 12 \):
- According to the problem description, the number of standing spectators at \( t = 12 \) should be \( 3 \) because the cycle starts again after \( n \) and the position \( 12 \mod 10 = 2 \), so \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) minus the offset \( 5 \) gives \( 3 \).
- However, the provided code prints \( 3 \) directly without considering the cyclic nature, which is correct for this specific case but fails for other similar cases.

Therefore, the code does not handle the cyclic nature of the problem correctly for all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
