Functionality: **The function reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( t \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), and \( 1 \leq t < n + k \). It then calculates and prints the result based on the following logic:
- If \( t \leq n \), it prints the minimum value between \( t \) and \( k \).
- If \( t > n \), it calculates the remainder when \( t - n \) is divided by \( k \) and subtracts this remainder from \( k \), then prints the result.**

This covers all potential cases as per the code. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases as described by the given code.
