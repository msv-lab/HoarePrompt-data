Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. When `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators is indeed `min(t, k)`, which is handled correctly.
2. When `t` is greater than `n`, the program calculates the number of standing spectators by using the formula `k - (t - n) % k`, which accounts for the cyclic nature of the wave.

The annotated version provides clear states and confirms that the logic works as intended for both cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
