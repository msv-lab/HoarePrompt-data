Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly simulate the Mexican wave scenario described in the problem description. Specifically, the logic in the code does not accurately determine how many spectators are standing at time \( t \).

Let's analyze the given code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k, t) = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

The code handles two main cases:
1. If \( t \leq n \), it prints the minimum value between \( t \) and \( k \).
2. If \( t > n \), it calculates the remainder when \( t - n \) is divided by \( k \) and subtracts this remainder from \( k \), then prints the result.

However, this logic does not correctly simulate the behavior of the Mexican wave. For example, let's consider the given test cases:

1. **Input:** `10 5 3`
   - According to the problem description, at time 3, the first 3 spectators stand, so the number of standing spectators should be 3.
   - However, the code outputs `3`, which is correct for this specific case.

2. **Input:** `10 5 7`
   - According to the problem description, at time 7, the first 5 spectators stand, and the next 2 spectators sit, so the number of standing spectators should be 5.
   - The code outputs `5`, which is correct for this specific case.

3. **Input:** `10 5 12`
   - According to the problem description, at time 12, the 10th spectator stands, and the 5th spectator sits, so the number of standing spectators should be 5.
   - The code outputs `3`, which is incorrect. The code incorrectly calculates the number of standing spectators as \( k - (t - n) \% k \), which results in 3 instead of 5.

To correctly simulate the Mexican wave, the code should keep track of which spectators are standing based on the time \( t \). The provided code does not maintain this state and instead uses a simpler arithmetic calculation that does not match the behavior described in the problem.

Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case, and the output hints also indicate that the logic does not accurately represent the Mexican wave scenario. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
