Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic for determining the number of standing spectators at time `t`. Let's break down the logic:

- If `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators is simply `min(t, k)` because up to time `n`, the first `k` spectators will be standing.
- If `t` is greater than `n`, the pattern of standing spectators repeats every `k` units after time `n`. Therefore, we calculate the remaining time by subtracting `n` from `t` and then taking the modulo `k` of this difference. The number of standing spectators is then `k - (t - n) % k`.

This logic covers all possible cases within the given constraints. For instance:
- When `t = 3` (within the first `n` seconds), the number of standing spectators is `3`.
- When `t = 7` (after the initial `k` seconds), the number of standing spectators is `5`.
- When `t = 12` (beyond the initial `n` seconds but within the repeating cycle), the number of standing spectators is `3`.

Since the program handles both the initial increasing phase and the subsequent repeating phase correctly, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the program fails to handle, the program is correct.
