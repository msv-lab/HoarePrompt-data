The code `n, k, t = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. Since the input values for `n`, `k`, and `t` are not specified in the initial state, they are treated as generic inputs that will replace the current values of `n`, `k`, and `t` respectively. The conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k must still hold true after the input is processed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k**
