Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Wave Pattern Mismatch**: The problem description describes a specific pattern of standing and sitting spectators over time. The program attempts to calculate the number of standing spectators based on the time `t`, but it does not fully capture the cyclic nature of the wave.

2. **Logic for Time Calculation**:
   - For `t <= n`, the number of standing spectators is `min(t, k)`. This part is correct as it matches the behavior described until the first cycle completes.
   - For `t > n`, the logic `k - (t - n) % k` is intended to handle the cyclic part. However, this logic does not accurately reflect the wave pattern described in the problem statement. Specifically:
     - At `t = n + 1`, the `(n + 1 - k)`-th spectator sits, not just the `k`-th spectator sitting as implied by the current logic.
     - The cyclic pattern should continue to decrement the standing spectators correctly, but the current logic does not ensure this.

To illustrate with examples from the problem statement:
- At `t = 6` (after the first complete cycle), the wave should be `---^^^^^` with 5 standing spectators.
- At `t = 12`, the wave should be `-------^^^` with 3 standing spectators.

The current program does not accurately simulate these transitions.

A corrected version would involve tracking the position within each cycle and ensuring the number of standing spectators is updated correctly based on the time `t`.

Here is a more accurate implementation:
```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= n:
        return min(t, k)
    else:
        # Calculate the position within the cycle
        cycle_position = (t - n) % k
        return k - cycle_position if cycle_position != 0 else k
```

This corrected version ensures the number of standing spectators is calculated accurately based on the problem description.
