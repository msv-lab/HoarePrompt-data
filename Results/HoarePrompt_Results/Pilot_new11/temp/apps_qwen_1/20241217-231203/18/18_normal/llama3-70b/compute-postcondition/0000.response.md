The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`. Since the input function replaces the current values of these variables, the original conditions (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k) are no longer relevant because the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are now determined by the input.

Therefore, the updated states of the variables are:

- `n` is now an integer input by the user.
- `k` is now an integer input by the user.
- `t` is now an integer input by the user.

The Output State is:
**`n` is an integer input by the user, `k` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user.**
