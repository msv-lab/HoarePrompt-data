The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block (such as a function or loop). In this case, since there is no loop or block context provided in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change any variable values and simply indicates that execution would exit the nearest loop or block.

Given the initial state and the fact that the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 4; the string '2' is printed to the console.**
