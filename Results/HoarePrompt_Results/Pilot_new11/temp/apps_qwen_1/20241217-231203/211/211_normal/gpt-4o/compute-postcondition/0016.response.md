According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length `n` of the list `A`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `A`. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions are true:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `A` is a list of `n` integers.
- `total_sum` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- If `A[i]` is not 0, then the output is '2 2' and `total_sum` is incremented by `A[i]`; otherwise, nothing changes.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 1. Since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `n` remains the same, as it is determined by the length of the list `A`.
- `A` remains the same, as it does not change within the loop.
- `total_sum` remains 0, as no elements have been processed yet.
- `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is 0; `i` is 1**
