You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Program:

    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if total_sum != 0:
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a flaw in how it handles cases where the entire array sums to zero. The program checks if the total sum of the array is not zero. If it is not zero, it prints "YES" and the entire array as a single segment. However, this approach fails when the array's total sum is zero because the program incorrectly assumes that no valid segmentation exists.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 -1 1 -1
```

In this case, the total sum is zero, but the array can be correctly segmented into:
```
YES
2
1 1
2 2
```

The current implementation will output "NO" for this case, which does not satisfy the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a list `A` of integers where the length of the list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3. After executing the function, the following states are possible:

1. If the sum of all elements in `A` is not zero, the function prints 'YES', '1', '1', and `n`. Here, 'YES' indicates that there is a way to partition the list into two parts with non-zero sums. '1' is the number of partitions, and the second '1' and `n` represent the start and end indices of the first partition.
   
2. If the sum of all elements in `A` is zero, the function searches for the first non-zero element in the list. If found, it prints 'YES', '2', '1', and `i+1`, followed by 'i+2' and `n`. Here, 'YES' indicates that there is a way to partition the list into two parts, '2' is the number of partitions, '1' and `i+1` represent the start and end indices of the first partition, and 'i+2' and `n` represent the start and end indices of the second partition. If no non-zero element is found, the function prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to partition the list into two parts with non-zero sums.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
