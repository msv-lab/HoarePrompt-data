The function processes a list `A` of integers where the length of the list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3. After executing the function, the following states are possible:

1. If the sum of all elements in `A` is not zero, the function prints 'YES', '1', '1', and `n`. Here, 'YES' indicates that there is a way to partition the list into two parts with non-zero sums. '1' is the number of partitions, and the second '1' and `n` represent the start and end indices of the first partition.
   
2. If the sum of all elements in `A` is zero, the function searches for the first non-zero element in the list. If found, it prints 'YES', '2', '1', and `i+1`, followed by 'i+2' and `n`. Here, 'YES' indicates that there is a way to partition the list into two parts, '2' is the number of partitions, '1' and `i+1` represent the start and end indices of the first partition, and 'i+2' and `n` represent the start and end indices of the second partition. If no non-zero element is found, the function prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to partition the list into two parts with non-zero sums.
