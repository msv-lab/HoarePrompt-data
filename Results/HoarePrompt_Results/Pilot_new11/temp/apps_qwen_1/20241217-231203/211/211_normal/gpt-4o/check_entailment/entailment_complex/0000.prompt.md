You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One spring day on his way to university Lesha found an array A. Lesha likes to split arrays into several parts. This time Lesha decided to split the array A into several, possibly one, new arrays so that the sum of elements in each of the new arrays is not zero. One more condition is that if we place the new arrays one after another they will form the old array A.

Lesha is tired now so he asked you to split the array. Help Lesha!


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array A.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^3 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3) — the elements of the array A.


-----Output-----

If it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line print single integer k — the number of new arrays. In each of the next k lines print two integers l_{i} and r_{i} which denote the subarray A[l_{i}... r_{i}] of the initial array A being the i-th new array. Integers l_{i}, r_{i} should satisfy the following conditions:  l_1 = 1  r_{k} = n  r_{i} + 1 = l_{i} + 1 for each 1 ≤ i < k. 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list A consists of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(A)
    if (total_sum != 0) :
        print('YES')
        print('1')
        print('1', n)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] != 0:
                print('YES')
                print('2')
                print('1', i + 1)
                print(i + 2, n)
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \); `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is 0; if the loop executes, `i` is the index of the first non-zero element in `A`, and the statements 'YES', '2', '1 i+1', 'i+2 n' are printed; if the loop does not execute, `i` is `n`, and 'NO' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`. If `total_sum` is not zero, the printed output is '1' and `n`. Otherwise, if `total_sum` is zero, either the index of the first non-zero element in `A` is found and the printed output is 'YES', '2', '1 i+1', 'i+2 n', or if no such element exists, the printed output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `A` of integers where the length of the list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3. After executing the function, the following states are possible:

1. If the sum of all elements in `A` is not zero, the function prints 'YES', '1', '1', and `n`. Here, 'YES' indicates that there is a way to partition the list into two parts with non-zero sums. '1' is the number of partitions, and the second '1' and `n` represent the start and end indices of the first partition.
   
2. If the sum of all elements in `A` is zero, the function searches for the first non-zero element in the list. If found, it prints 'YES', '2', '1', and `i+1`, followed by 'i+2' and `n`. Here, 'YES' indicates that there is a way to partition the list into two parts, '2' is the number of partitions, '1' and `i+1` represent the start and end indices of the first partition, and 'i+2' and `n` represent the start and end indices of the second partition. If no non-zero element is found, the function prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to partition the list into two parts with non-zero sums.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
