The code `print(k, l, r)` simply prints the values of the variables `k`, `l`, and `r`. These variables are not altered by the print statement. Therefore, the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` remain the same after executing the code.

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `3`, `l` is `2`, `r` is `3`, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`. The values of `k`, `l`, and `r` are printed.**
