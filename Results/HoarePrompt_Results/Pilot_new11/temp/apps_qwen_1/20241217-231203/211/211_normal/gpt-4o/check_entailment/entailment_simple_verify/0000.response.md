Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version and the problem description, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array consists entirely of zeros. According to the problem description, if it is not possible to split the array such that each subarray's sum is not zero, the output should be "NO". However, the current implementation incorrectly outputs "YES" and provides a split for such cases. For example, given the input:

```
1
0
```

The program outputs "YES", which is incorrect. The annotated version clearly shows that if the loop does not execute (i.e., there are no non-zero elements), the program prints "NO". However, this is not being handled correctly in the implementation, leading to the incorrect output for inputs like `[0, 0, 0]` or `[0]`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the program fails to correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are zero, which is a requirement stated in the problem description.
