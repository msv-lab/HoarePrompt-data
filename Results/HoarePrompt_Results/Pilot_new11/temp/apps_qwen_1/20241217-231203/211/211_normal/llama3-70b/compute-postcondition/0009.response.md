Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Analysis

Given the loop code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `prefix_sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros initially.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
   - For each iteration, the value at `prefix_sum[i + 1]` is updated to be the sum of the previous value in `prefix_sum` (i.e., `prefix_sum[i]`) and the corresponding element in the list `a` (i.e., `a[i]`).

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `prefix_sum` will store cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.

### Output State Calculation

Let's consider the final state after the loop has executed `n` times.

- The initial value of `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`.
- For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the value at `prefix_sum[i+1]` is updated to `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`.

After `n` iterations, the values in `prefix_sum` will be:
- `prefix_sum[0]` remains `0` (as it is not updated).
- `prefix_sum[1]` becomes `a[0]`.
- `prefix_sum[2]` becomes `a[0] + a[1]`.
- ...
- `prefix_sum[n]` becomes `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1]`.

### Final Output State

The final state of the variables after the loop has executed all iterations can be summarized as follows:

- `prefix_sum[0]` is `0`.
- `prefix_sum[1]` is the sum of the first element of `a`.
- `prefix_sum[2]` is the sum of the first two elements of `a`.
- ...
- `prefix_sum[n]` is the sum of all elements in `a`.

Thus, the output state is:

**Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`.**
