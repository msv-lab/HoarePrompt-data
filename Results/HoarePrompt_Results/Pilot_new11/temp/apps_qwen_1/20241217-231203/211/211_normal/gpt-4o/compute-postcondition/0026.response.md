The code `print('1', i + 1)` prints the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 5, `i + 1` evaluates to 6. The output of the print statement is '1 6', but this does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the variables remain in their initial states, and the precondition is maintained.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 5, and the output is 'YES'**
