Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to consider the scenario where the entire array has a sum of zero and does not contain any non-zero elements. In such a case, the code will incorrectly print "NO," which is not allowed since the problem description allows for the possibility of splitting the array into subarrays with non-zero sums even if those subarrays are just individual elements.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
4
1 -1 1 -1
```

The sum of the entire array is zero, and no single subarray has a non-zero sum. According to the problem description, the correct output should be "NO." However, the provided code would not handle this case correctly and would instead attempt to split the array, leading to an incorrect output.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the Correctness is **False**.
