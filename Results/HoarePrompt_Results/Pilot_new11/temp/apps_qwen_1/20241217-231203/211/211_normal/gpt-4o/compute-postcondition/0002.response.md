The code `total_sum = sum(A)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `A` and assigns it to the variable `total_sum`. Since `A` is a list of `n` integers and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `total_sum` will hold the sum of these `n` integers. The values of `n` and `A` themselves are not altered, only a new variable `total_sum` is introduced with its value being the sum of the elements in `A`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers; `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`**
