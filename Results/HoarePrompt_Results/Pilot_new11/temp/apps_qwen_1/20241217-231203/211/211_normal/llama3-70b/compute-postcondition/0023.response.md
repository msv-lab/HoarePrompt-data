The code `print(k, l, r)` simply prints the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. It does not change any of the variable values. Therefore, the values of `prefix_sum[0]`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, and `prefix_sum[r]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `2`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `2`, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`**
