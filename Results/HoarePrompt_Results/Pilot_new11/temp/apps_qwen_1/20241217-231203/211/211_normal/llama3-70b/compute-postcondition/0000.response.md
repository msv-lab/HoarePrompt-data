The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` is now set to the integer input by the user, while the array `A` remains undefined because no elements have been read yet. 

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, the array `A` is undefined**
