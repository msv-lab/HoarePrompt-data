The code `l = r` assigns the value of `r` (which is 3) to `l`. The value of `r` is 3, and all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `3`, `r` is `3`, and `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`.**
