The code prints '1', followed by the value of `i + 1`. Since the initial state has `i` as 0, `i + 1` will be 1. The print statement does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, A is a list of n integers, total_sum is 0, i is 0, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, the output is '2', and we have printed '1 1'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, A is a list of n integers, total_sum is 0, i is 0, the current value of `A[i]` is not 0, the output is '2', and we have printed '1 1'**
