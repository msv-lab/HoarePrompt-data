The code `print(k, l, r)` simply prints the values of the variables `k`, `l`, and `r`. These values are not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`prefix_sum[0]` is `0`, `prefix_sum[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, the sum of the first `n` elements of `a` is not `0`, `k` is `1`, `l` is `1`, `r` is `1`, `prefix_sum[r]` is not `0` and `prefix_sum[r]` is not equal to `prefix_sum[n]`**
