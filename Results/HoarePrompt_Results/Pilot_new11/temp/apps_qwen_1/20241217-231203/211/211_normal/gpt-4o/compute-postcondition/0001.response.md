The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `A`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `A` is a list of `n` integers, the value of `n` is not directly affected by this line of code, but the content of `A` changes.

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `A` is a list of `n` integers. After executing the given code, `A` will be updated with the new list of integers provided by the user. The value of `n` remains the same, but the contents of `A` change based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `A` is a list of `n` integers**
