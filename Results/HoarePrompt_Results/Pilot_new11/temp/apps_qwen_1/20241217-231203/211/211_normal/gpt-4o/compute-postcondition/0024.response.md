The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is the output of the string 'YES', but this does not alter the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is 0, `i` is 5, and the output is 'YES'**
