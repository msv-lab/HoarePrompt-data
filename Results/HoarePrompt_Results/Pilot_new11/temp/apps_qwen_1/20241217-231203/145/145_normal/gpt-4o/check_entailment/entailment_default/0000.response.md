Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through all possible segment lengths and checks if the ticket can be split into segments with equal sums. It uses the helper function `segment_sum` to calculate the sum of a specific segment of the ticket string.

The code handles the following cases:
1. It checks all possible segment lengths from 1 to `n-1`.
2. It calculates the target sum for each segment length.
3. It checks if the ticket can be split into segments with that sum.
4. If a valid split is found, it returns 'YES'.
5. If no valid split is found, it returns 'NO'.

The edge cases, such as when `n` is exactly 2, are also handled appropriately. The function checks if the digits in the ticket are equal, which would indicate a valid split into one segment.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the code correctly determines whether the ticket is lucky or not for every potential case.
