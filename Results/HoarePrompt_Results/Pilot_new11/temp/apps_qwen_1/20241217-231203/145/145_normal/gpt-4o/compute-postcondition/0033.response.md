Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is 1, and `segment_length` is `n`. This holds true whether `current_sum` equals `target_sum` or not, as there is no else part that changes these variables differently.***
