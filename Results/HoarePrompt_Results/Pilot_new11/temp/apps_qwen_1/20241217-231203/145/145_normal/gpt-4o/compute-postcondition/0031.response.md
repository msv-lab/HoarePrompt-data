The code sets `current_sum` to 0, effectively resetting it from its previous value. The previous value of `current_sum` was the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, which is equal to `target_sum`. After this assignment, `current_sum` is explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is 0, `segment_length` is `n`**
