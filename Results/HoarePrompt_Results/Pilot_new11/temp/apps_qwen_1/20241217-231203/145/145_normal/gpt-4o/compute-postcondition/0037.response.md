The `segment_count` variable is incremented by 1. The initial value of `segment_count` is 1, so after the increment, it becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is 2, and `segment_length` is `n`.**
