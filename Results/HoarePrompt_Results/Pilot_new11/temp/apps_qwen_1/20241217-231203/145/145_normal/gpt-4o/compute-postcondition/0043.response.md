Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `current_sum` is the sum of the first two digits of the ticket, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is 2, and `segment_length` is `n`. If the sum of the current two digits (`current_sum`) equals the target sum (`target_sum`), then `current_sum` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `current_sum` remains as the sum of the first two digits.***
