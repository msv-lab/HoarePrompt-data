Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `ticket` consisting of exactly `n` digits (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`) and returns either `False` or a boolean value indicating whether the number of segments in which the sum of digits equals half the total sum is at least 2. 

Specifically, the function first checks if the total sum of digits in `ticket` is even. If it is odd, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it calculates the target sum as half of the total sum. It then iterates through the digits of `ticket`, maintaining a running sum (`curr_sum`). Whenever `curr_sum` equals the target sum, it increments the segment count (`segments`) and resets `curr_sum`. After processing all digits, the function returns `True` if there are at least two segments where the sum of digits equals the target sum, otherwise it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `ticket` is a string of even length digits and the sum of all digits is even but no segment sums match the target sum, the function will return `False`.
- If `ticket` contains fewer than 2 digits, the function will return `False` because the condition `segments >= 2` cannot be met.
- If `ticket` contains only one segment (i.e., the entire string), the function will return `False` unless all digits sum to twice the single segment sum.**

This summary captures the actual functionality of the code, including the edge cases and missing logic.
