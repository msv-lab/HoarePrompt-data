`curr_sum` is incremented by the current `digit`, which is a part of the string `ticket`. Since the exact digit being added is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `curr_sum`. However, we know that `curr_sum` was initially `0`, so after adding one digit from `ticket`, `curr_sum` will be the value of that digit. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of at least 1 digit and no more than 100 digits, each character is a digit between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is total_sum // 2, `curr_sum` is the value of the first digit in `ticket`, `segments` is 0**
