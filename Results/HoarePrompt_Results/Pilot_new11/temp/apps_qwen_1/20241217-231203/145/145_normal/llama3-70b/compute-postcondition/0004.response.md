The code assigns the value of `total_sum // 2` to `target_sum`. The value of `total_sum` is given as even, so `target_sum` will be half of an even number, which is also an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of exactly n digits where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each character in the string is a digit between '0' and '9'; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` (and is even); `target_sum` is total_sum // 2**
