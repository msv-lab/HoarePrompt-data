The function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)` calculates the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of the ticket, which is 1. Since `segment_length` is 1, it means we are summing the first 1 digit. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `current_sum` is 0
- `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket
- `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`
- `segment_length` is 1

After executing `target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `target_sum` is updated to be the sum of the first 1 digit, which is the same as the first digit of the ticket.

Since the initial value of `segment_length` is 1, `target_sum` becomes the first digit of the ticket. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the first digit of the ticket, `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`, `segment_length` is 1**
