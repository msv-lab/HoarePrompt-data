The code sets `current_sum` to 0, which overrides the previous value of `current_sum`. The initial value of `current_sum` was updated by adding `int(ticket[0])` to its current value and was equal to `target_sum`. After setting `current_sum` to 0, the value of `current_sum` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `current_sum` is 0, and the current value of `current_sum` is equal to `target_sum`**
