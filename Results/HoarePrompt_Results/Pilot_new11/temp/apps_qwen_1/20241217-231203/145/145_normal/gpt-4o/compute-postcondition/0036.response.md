The line `current_sum = 0` sets the value of `current_sum` to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `current_sum` is 0, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n` digits of the ticket, `segment_count` is 1, and `segment_length` is `n`.**
