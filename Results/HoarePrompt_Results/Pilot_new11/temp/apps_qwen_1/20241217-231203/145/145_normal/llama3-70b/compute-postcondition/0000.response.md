The code `total_sum = sum(ticket)` calculates the sum of all digits in the `ticket` string and assigns it to the variable `total_sum`. Since `ticket` is a string of digits, the `sum()` function will convert each character to an integer and add them together.

Given the initial state: `ticket` is a string consisting of exactly n digits where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each character in the string is a digit between '0' and '9'.

After executing the code, `ticket` remains unchanged, but `total_sum` is now the sum of the digits in `ticket`.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of exactly n digits where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each character in the string is a digit between '0' and '9'; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`.**
