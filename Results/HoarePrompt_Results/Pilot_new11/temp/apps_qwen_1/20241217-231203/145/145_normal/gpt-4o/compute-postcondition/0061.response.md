`segment_count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`i`, `current_sum`, and `segment_length`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `segment_length` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `segment_length` is 1**
