The code `curr_sum += digit` updates the value of `curr_sum` by adding the current digit to its current value. Since the initial state specifies that `curr_sum` is the sum of the digits processed so far plus the current digit, adding another digit to it will simply increase `curr_sum` by the value of the current digit.

Given the initial conditions:
- `ticket` is a string consisting of at least 1 digit and no more than 99 digits, each character is a digit between '0' and '9'.
- `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even.
- `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
- `curr_sum` is the sum of the digits processed so far plus the current digit.
- `segments` is 2.

The code will update `curr_sum` by adding the current digit to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of at least 1 digit and no more than 99 digits, each character is a digit between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is total_sum // 2, `curr_sum` is the sum of the digits processed so far plus the current digit (increased by the current digit), `segments` is 2**
