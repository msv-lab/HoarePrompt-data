This function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` where `x >= y > 0`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD by repeatedly replacing `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At that point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function returns `x` as the result. Potential edge cases include when `y` is 0; in this case, the function correctly returns `x` as the GCD since `x` is initially greater than or equal to `y` and `x` is never updated further once `y` becomes 0. There are no missing functionalities in the given code.
