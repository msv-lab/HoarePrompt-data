The code snippet `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` updates the value of `dp[i + a]` by adding `dp[i]` to it. The initial state is given as follows:
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `a` is `input_a`
- `b` is `input_b`
- `dp` is a list where the first element is 1 and the remaining elements are 0.

The impact of the code on the program is that it modifies the `dp` list. Specifically, it increments the value at index `i + a` in the `dp` list by the value at index `i`.

Since the initial state of `dp` is `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with the exact number of zeros depending on the length of the list), and assuming `i` and `a` are valid indices for the list, the value at `dp[i + a]` will be incremented by `dp[i]`.

Given that `dp[i]` is initially 0 (if `i` is not 0) or 1 (if `i` is 0), and considering the initial state, the only way `dp[i + a]` could be non-zero is if `dp[i]` is 1 and `i + a` is the first index of the list (which is 0).

Therefore, the updated state of `dp` will be:
- `dp[0]` will be incremented by `dp[i]`.
- If `dp[i]` is 1, `dp[0]` will become 2.
- Otherwise, `dp[0]` remains 1, and all other elements in `dp` remain 0.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`, `dp` is a list where the first element is either 1 or 2 and the remaining elements are 0.**
