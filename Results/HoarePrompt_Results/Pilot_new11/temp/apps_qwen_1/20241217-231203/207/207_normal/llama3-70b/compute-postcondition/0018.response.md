The code `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` updates the value of `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - b]` to it. Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

- `m` is a non-negative integer and remains unchanged.
- `a` is `input_a` and remains unchanged.
- `b` is `input_b` and remains unchanged.
- `dp` is a list where the first element is either 1 or 2 and the remaining elements are 0. The value of `dp[i]` is updated by adding `dp[i - b]` to it.

Since the initial state of `dp` is defined such that the first element is either 1 or 2 and the rest are 0, the specific value of `dp[i]` depends on the value of `dp[i - b]`. If `i - b` is less than 0, then `dp[i - b]` is 0, and thus `dp[i]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated by adding `dp[i - b]` to its current value.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`, `dp` is a list where the first element is either 1 or 2 and the remaining elements are 0, and `dp[i]` is updated by adding `dp[i - b]` to its current value.**
