The function `func` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\).
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).

There are no explicit output cases provided, but based on the constraints, the function likely performs some operation involving these parameters.

Given the information provided, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters: `m` (a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\)), `a` (a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\)), and `b` (a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\)).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).**
