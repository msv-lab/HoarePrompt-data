Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It calculates the number of ways to reach each value from 0 to `m` using only steps of size `a` and `b`. Specifically, it initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the value `i`. The function then iterates through all possible values up to `m`, updating `dp` based on the values of `a` and `b`. Finally, the function prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, which represents the total number of ways to reach any value from 0 to `m` using steps of `a` and `b`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function handles the case where `m` is within the specified range and `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- However, it does not handle the case where `a` or `b` is greater than `m`, which would result in `dp[i + a]` or `dp[i - b]` being out of bounds. This could be handled by adding appropriate checks to ensure that `i + a` and `i - b` do not exceed the length of the `dp` array.
- The function does not include any error handling for invalid inputs such as negative values for `a` or `b`, or `m` less than 1. These should be checked at the beginning of the function.
- The function assumes that `dp` is initialized with all zeros except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 1. This initialization ensures that there is one way to stay at position 0, which is by doing nothing.
