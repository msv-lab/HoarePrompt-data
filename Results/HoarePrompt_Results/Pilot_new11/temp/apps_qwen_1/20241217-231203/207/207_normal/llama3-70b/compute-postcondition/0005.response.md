The code `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` increments the value of `dp[i + a]` by `dp[i]`. Given the initial state where `dp` is a list with the first element being 1 and the rest being 0, and the condition `i + a` is within the bounds of `dp`, the value of `dp[i + a]` will be updated.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step calculation:

- Initially, `dp` is `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with the first element being 1 and the rest being 0).
- The code updates `dp[i + a]` by adding `dp[i]` to it.
- Since `dp[i]` is 1 (as per the initial state), `dp[i + a]` will become `dp[i + a] + 1`.

Therefore, the updated list `dp` will have its `(i + a)`-th element incremented by 1.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is input_a, `b` is input_b, `dp` is a list where the first element is 1 and the remaining elements are 0, `dp[i + a]` is incremented by 1, and the index `i` plus `a` is less than or equal to `m`.**
