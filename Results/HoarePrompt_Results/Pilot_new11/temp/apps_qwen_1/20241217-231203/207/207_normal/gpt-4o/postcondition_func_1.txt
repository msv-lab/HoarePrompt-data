The function `func_2(m, a, b)` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It returns one of three possible results based on the values of `m`, `a`, and `b`:

1. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` (returned by `func_1(a, b)`) is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, where `g` is the GCD, and multiplies the result by `g`.
2. If `m < a + b - 1`, the function returns \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\).
3. Otherwise, the function calculates two sums: `sum_k` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k = a + b - 1`, and `sum_m` as `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`. It then returns the sum of these two sums.

This function effectively handles the GCD case, the simple arithmetic case, and the combined summation case, ensuring all potential scenarios are covered.
