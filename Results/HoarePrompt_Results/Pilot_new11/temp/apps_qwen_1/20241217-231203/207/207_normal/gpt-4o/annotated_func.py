#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers where x >= y > 0.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` where `x >= y > 0`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD by repeatedly replacing `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At that point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function returns `x` as the result. Potential edge cases include when `y` is 0; in this case, the function correctly returns `x` as the GCD since `x` is initially greater than or equal to `y` and `x` is never updated further once `y` becomes 0. There are no missing functionalities in the given code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\).
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #`The program returns the result of func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where g is the return value of func_1(a, b)`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and \(g\) is equal to 1
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #`(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2` where `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\), `g` is equal to 1, `k` is `a + b - 1`, and \(m \geq k\)
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #`The program returns sum_k which is k * (k + 1) // 2 plus sum_m which is m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2, where k is a + b - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2(m, a, b)` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It returns one of three possible results based on the values of `m`, `a`, and `b`:

1. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` (returned by `func_1(a, b)`) is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, where `g` is the GCD, and multiplies the result by `g`.
2. If `m < a + b - 1`, the function returns \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\).
3. Otherwise, the function calculates two sums: `sum_k` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k = a + b - 1`, and `sum_m` as `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`. It then returns the sum of these two sums.

This function effectively handles the GCD case, the simple arithmetic case, and the combined summation case, ensuring all potential scenarios are covered.
