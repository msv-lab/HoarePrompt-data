The function `func()` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^5\). It calculates the number of ways to reach each value from 0 to `m` using only steps of size `a` and `b`. Specifically, it initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the value `i`. The function then iterates through all possible values up to `m`, updating `dp` based on the values of `a` and `b`. Finally, the function prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, which represents the total number of ways to reach any value from 0 to `m` using steps of `a` and `b`.
