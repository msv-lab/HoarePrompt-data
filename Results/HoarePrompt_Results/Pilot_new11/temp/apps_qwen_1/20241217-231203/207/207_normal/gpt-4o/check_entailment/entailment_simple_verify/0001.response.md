Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when \(m < a + b - 1\) and \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime. The annotated version shows that the function `func_2` includes unnecessary recursive calls and additional calculations, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Specifically, when \(m < a + b - 1\), the program should directly return \((m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\), which it currently does not do. This oversight causes the program to produce incorrect sums in tests where \(m\) is smaller than \(a + b - 1\). Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is maintained.
