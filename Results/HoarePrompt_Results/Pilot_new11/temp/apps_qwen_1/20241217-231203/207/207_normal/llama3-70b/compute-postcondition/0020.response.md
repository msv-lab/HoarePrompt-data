Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is `input_a`, `b` is `input_b`, and `dp` is a list where the first element is 1 and the remaining elements are 0. For every index `i` in the range `[0, m]`, `dp[i]` contains the number of ways to reach `i` using steps of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible indices from `0` to `m`.
- For each index `i`, it checks two conditions:
  1. If `i + a <= m`, it updates `dp[i + a]` by adding `dp[i]`.
  2. If `i - b >= 0`, it updates `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - b]`.

These updates ensure that `dp[i]` accumulates the number of ways to reach `index i` using steps of `a` and `b`. Since the loop runs for all indices up to `m`, `dp[i]` will contain the correct count for reaching each index `i` by the end of the loop.

The first element of `dp` is always initialized to 1 because there is exactly one way to stay at the starting point (index 0) without taking any steps. All other elements are initialized to 0 and will be updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
