You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of products that can be sold by choosing the optimal days for sell-outs.

Here’s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Regular Sales Calculation**: For each day, the program calculates the number of products sold if no sell-out is conducted, which is `min(k, l)` (the minimum of the number of products available and the number of customers).

2. **Potential Sales Increase**: The program then calculates the potential increase in sales if a sell-out is conducted, which is `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` (the difference between selling twice the number of products available and the number of customers).

3. **Total Sales Calculation**: The program sums up the regular sales and adds the maximum potential sales increase for the chosen number of sell-out days (`f`).

This approach ensures that the program maximizes the total number of products sold by strategically choosing the days with the highest potential sales increase.

Since the program follows the logic accurately and handles all the given examples correctly, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\).
- `days` is a list of \(n\) tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers \(k_i\) and \(l_i\) such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\). These integers represent the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for the \(i\)-th day, respectively.

The function processes the `days` list to calculate two lists: `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase`. For each day, `regular_sales` stores the minimum of the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients, while `potential_sales_increase` stores the difference between twice the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients, minus the value stored in `regular_sales`.

After calculating these lists, the function computes `total_sales` by summing the values in `regular_sales` and then adding the sum of the first `f` elements of `potential_sales_increase`, sorted in reverse order. Finally, the function returns `total_sales`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `f` is 0, no additional sales from `potential_sales_increase` are added to `total_sales`.
- If `f` equals `n`, all elements in `potential_sales_increase` are considered, up to the maximum possible value.
- If `k_i` equals `l_i` for all days, `potential_sales_increase` will be empty, resulting in no additional sales from this list.

In summary, the function calculates the total sales considering both regular sales and potential sales increases, with the latter being limited to the top `f` values after sorting.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
