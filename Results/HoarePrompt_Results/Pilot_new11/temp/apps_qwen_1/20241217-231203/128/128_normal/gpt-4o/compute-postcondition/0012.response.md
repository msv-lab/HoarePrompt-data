`total_sales` is assigned the value of the sum of `regular_sales`. The value of `total_sales` depends on the values in `regular_sales`, which in turn depends on the values of `k` and `l` for each iteration. However, since the exact values of `k` and `l` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `total_sales`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`days` is a list of 0 tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l` for each iteration, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each iteration, `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`**
