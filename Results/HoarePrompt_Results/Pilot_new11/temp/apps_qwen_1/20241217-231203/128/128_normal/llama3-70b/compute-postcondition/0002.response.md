Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n` and `f` are integers.
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `0 ≤ f ≤ n`.
   - `days` is an empty list.
   - The values of `k_i` and `l_i` are undefined.
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations using `range(n)`.

2. **Determine the Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, this condition is always satisfied given the constraints.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `days` is initially an empty list, and the loop does not modify its length directly within the loop body.
   - The values of `k_i` and `l_i` are undefined but do not affect the loop execution itself.
   - The variables `n` and `f` must satisfy their constraints, but since they are given to be valid (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `0 ≤ f ≤ n`), no adjustment is needed for these specific values.

4. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1, which it already is based on the given constraints.
   - The initial state of `days` being an empty list is acceptable.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`days` is an empty list, and `n` and `f` are integers such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `0 ≤ f ≤ n`**.
