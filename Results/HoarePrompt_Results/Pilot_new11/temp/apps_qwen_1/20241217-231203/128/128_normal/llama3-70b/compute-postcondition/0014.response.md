Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `days` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple.
- `f` is an integer such that `0 ≤ f ≤ n`.
- `sold` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be initialized to `0` at the start of the loop.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The value of `n` determines the number of iterations in the loop.
   - Since the loop iterates over `range(n)`, `n` must be at least `1` (i.e., `n > 0`) to ensure the loop runs at least once.

3. **Variable `sold`:**
   - The problem states that `sold` is `0` initially.
   - This variable does not affect the loop condition but might change during the loop iterations.

4. **Variable `f`:**
   - The variable `f` is mentioned as being in the range `0 ≤ f ≤ n`.
   - However, `f` does not directly influence the loop execution. It could be used within the loop, but its current value is not necessary to ensure the loop runs.

### Conclusion:
The key variables to adjust for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

- `i` should be set to `0` because the loop starts iterating from `0`.
- `n` should be greater than `0` to ensure the loop runs at least once.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`days` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple, `f` is an integer such that `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `sold` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
