The code sets `max_sum` to the value of `digit_sum`. From the initial state, we know that `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i`. Therefore, `max_sum` is now equal to `digit_sum`.

- `x` must be at least 1 (unchanged).
- `max_num` is still equal to the maximum number between `i + 1` and `i + 2` (unchanged).
- `max_sum` is now equal to `digit_sum` (changed).
- `digit_sum` remains unchanged as it was already defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1; `max_num` is equal to the maximum number between `i + 1` and `i + 2`; `max_sum` is equal to `digit_sum`; `digit_sum` is the sum of digits of `i`.**
