The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a string representing a positive integer `x`, where `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it implies that the function might process or return the integer value of the string `x`. However, since no specific return value is mentioned, we will focus on the input parameter.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string representing a positive integer `x`, where `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18`.**
