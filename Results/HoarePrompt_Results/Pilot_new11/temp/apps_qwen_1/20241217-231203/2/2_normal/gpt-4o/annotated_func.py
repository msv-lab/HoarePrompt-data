#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n, where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and returns the sum of its digits. The function converts the integer `n` to a string to iterate over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up. This process works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations.
