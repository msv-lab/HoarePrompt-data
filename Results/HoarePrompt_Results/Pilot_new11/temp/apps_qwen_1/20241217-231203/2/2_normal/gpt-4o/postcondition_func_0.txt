The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and returns the sum of its digits. The function converts the integer `n` to a string to iterate over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up. This process works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations.
