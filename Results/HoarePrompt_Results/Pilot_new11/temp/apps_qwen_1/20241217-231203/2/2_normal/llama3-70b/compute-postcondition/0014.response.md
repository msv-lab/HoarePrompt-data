Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `x`: A variable that represents the upper limit of the loop.
   - `i`: The loop variable that increments from 1 to `x`.
   - `max_num`: The maximum value between `i` and `i + 1`.
   - `max_sum`: The greater digit sum between the digit sum of `i` and the digit sum of `i + 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` must be at least 1.
   - `max_num` is equal to the maximum number between `i` and `i + 1`.
   - `max_sum` is equal to the greater digit sum between the digit sum of `i` and the digit sum of `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 1 until `i = x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k`, and `max_num` and `max_sum` were calculated based on `k` and `k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - Since `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `max_num` should now be the maximum between `k + 1` and `k + 2`.
   - Similarly, `max_sum` should now be the greater digit sum between the digit sum of `k + 1` and the digit sum of `k + 2`.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `x` remains the same (since it's the upper limit of the loop).
   - `i` will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `max_num` will be the maximum between `k + 1` and `k + 2`.
   - `max_sum` will be the greater digit sum between the digit sum of `k + 1` and the digit sum of `k + 2`.

Given these steps, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`x` must be at least 1, `max_num` is equal to the maximum number between `i + 1` and `i + 2`, and `max_sum` is equal to the greater digit sum between the digit sum of `i + 1` and the digit sum of `i + 2`.**
