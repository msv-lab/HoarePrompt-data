The code `print(max_num)` prints the value of `max_num`. This does not change the value of `max_num`, `x`, or `max_sum`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer value such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_num` is the integer within the range [1, `x`] that has the highest digit sum, and `max_sum` is the digit sum of `max_num`. `max_num` is printed.**
