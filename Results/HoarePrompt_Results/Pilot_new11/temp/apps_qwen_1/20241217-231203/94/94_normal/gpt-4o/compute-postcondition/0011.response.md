The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` that is a copy of the list `current`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `current`, so we only know that `new_state` is a list identical to `current`. The variables `queue`, `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`queue` must not be empty, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `new_state` is a list equal to `current`**
