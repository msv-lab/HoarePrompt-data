Output State: **`queue` is empty, `visited` contains all unique reachable states from the initial state `start`, `directions` remains as `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` do not exist since the loop has terminated, `empty_pos` does not exist since the loop has terminated, `current` does not exist since the loop has terminated, `new_row` and `new_col` do not exist since the loop has terminated, `new_pos` does not exist since the loop has terminated, `new_state` does not exist since the loop has terminated, `new_state_str` does not exist since the loop has terminated.**
