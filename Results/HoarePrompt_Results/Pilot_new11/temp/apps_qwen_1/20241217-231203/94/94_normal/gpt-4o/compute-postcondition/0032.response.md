The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list from the `current` list and assigns it to `new_state`. However, the initial values of `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are not directly affected by this line of code. They remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list created from `current`**
