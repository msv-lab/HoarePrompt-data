The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This operation does not change the values of `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_state`, or `new_state_str`. It only affects the `visited` set by adding one more element to it.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`; `visited` contains at least one more element (the string representation of `new_state`).**
