The code creates a new list `new_state` by copying the contents of the `current` list. The values of `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the `current` list is updated to `new_state`.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current` is now `new_state`**
