Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the sliding logic required to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. Instead, it simply swaps the positions of the empty cells and checks if the sorted strings of the puzzles are equal, which is not a valid approach for this problem. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
AB
XC
AC
XB
```

The correct solution would involve simulating the sliding of tiles until the configurations match or determining that it's impossible to match them through valid moves. The current implementation does not account for the sliding of tiles and thus will incorrectly return "YES" for this case.
