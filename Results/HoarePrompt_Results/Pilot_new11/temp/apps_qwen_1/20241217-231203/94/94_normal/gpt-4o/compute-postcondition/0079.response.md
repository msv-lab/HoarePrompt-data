Output State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current` is the first element of `queue` before `popleft()`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing the string representations of all unique states encountered during the execution of the loop, and `queue` is updated to be the queue without its first element, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.**
