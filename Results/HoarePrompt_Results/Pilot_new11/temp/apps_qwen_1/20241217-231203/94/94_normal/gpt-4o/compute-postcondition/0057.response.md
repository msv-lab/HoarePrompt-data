The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` by adding `dr` and `dc` to `empty_row` and `empty_col`, respectively. The original values of `new_row` and `new_col` are based on `empty_row + dr` and `empty_col + dc`, where `(dr, dc)` is the next pair in `directions`. After executing the code, `new_row` and `new_col` will be updated to their new values, but the precondition that `directions` contains at least one element remains unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
