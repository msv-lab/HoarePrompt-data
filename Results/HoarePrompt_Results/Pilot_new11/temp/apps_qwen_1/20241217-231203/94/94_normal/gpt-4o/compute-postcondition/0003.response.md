State right before the while loop, the conditions for the loop to execute depend on the `queue`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `queue`. Right before the loop, `queue` contains `start`.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure that `queue` is not empty. Since `queue` initially contains `start`, no adjustment is necessary to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing `start`, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
