The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This operation does not change the values of any variables except adding `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. Therefore, the output state is that `visited` now contains the new state's string representation.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current` is now `new_state`, `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`, `visited` now contains `new_state_str`.**
