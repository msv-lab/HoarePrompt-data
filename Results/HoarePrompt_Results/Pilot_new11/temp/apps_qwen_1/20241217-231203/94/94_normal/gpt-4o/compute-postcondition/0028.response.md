Postcondition: ***`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, the program either continues execution with `new_state_str` added to `visited` and `queue` if it is not already present, or does not add it again if it is already present. If these conditions are not met, the program does nothing.***
