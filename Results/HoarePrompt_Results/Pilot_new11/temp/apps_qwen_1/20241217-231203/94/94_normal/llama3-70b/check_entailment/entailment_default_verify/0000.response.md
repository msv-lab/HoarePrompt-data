Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the sliding logic required to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. Instead, it incorrectly swaps the positions of the 'X' characters and checks if the remaining characters are the same in any order. This approach is not valid for solving the problem as it does not simulate the actual sliding moves of the tiles. The output hints confirm that the function only checks if the remaining characters are the same after swapping the 'X' positions, which is insufficient for determining the solvability of the puzzle configurations. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and cannot correctly determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration.
