ou have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. 
In the information given, the output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times:  n must initially be greater than 0, `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` must have been greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` must have been  had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students', inital value of students must have been greater than 0
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students', initial value of students must have been greater than 1
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students', initial value of students must have been greater than 2

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**
Your Task:

Initial State: `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, `queue` is a deque containing `start`, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
Code of the loop:
```
while queue:
    current = queue.popleft()
    empty_pos = current.index('X')
    empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
    for dr, dc in directions:
        new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
        if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
            new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
            new_state = list(current)
            new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos
                ], new_state[empty_pos]
            new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
            if new_state_str not in visited:
                visited.add(new_state_str)
                queue.append(new_state_str)

```

The output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `queue` contains all possible reachable states from the initial state `start` that have not been visited, `visited` contains all previously visited states, `directions` remains as `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `empty_row` is the row index of the empty space in the current state, `empty_col` is the column index of the empty space in the current state, `empty_pos` remains as `empty_row * 2 + empty_col`, `current` is the leftmost element of `queue` before each iteration, `new_row` and `new_col` are the new positions of the empty space based on the direction `(dr, dc)`, `new_pos` is the position index of the new state, `new_state` is a list of the current state with the empty space moved to the new position, `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, and if a new state is not in `visited`, it is added to both `visited` and `queue`. If a new state is already in `visited`, it is not added again.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current` is the final state obtained by performing all valid moves in `directions` starting from the original `current` state, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing the string representations of all unique states encountered during the execution of the loop, `queue` is a list containing the string representations of all states generated during the loop execution that are not yet in `visited`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: - `directions` is a non-empty list.
- `new_row` and `new_col` are the coordinates of the potential new position of the empty tile after the last valid move.
- `new_pos` is `(new_row) * 2 + (new_col)`.
- `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.
- `new_state_str` is a string representation of `new_state`.
- `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been explored.
- `queue` contains all unique states that can be reached from the initial state by valid moves.
- `current` is the current state of the puzzle before the last valid move.
- `empty_row` and `empty_col` are the coordinates of the empty tile in the last valid move.

Output State:

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state, after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
If the state of some variables is dependant on earlier or the oginal value of some variable, make sure to seprate the original value from the current value.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
