The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` by adding `dr` to `empty_row` and `dc` to `empty_col`. The conditions `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2` are already checked for the next direction, so these checks do not affect the assignment. The output state will reflect the updated values of `new_row` and `new_col`.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
