The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `start`. `start` is a string representing the initial configuration of a 2x2 sliding puzzle, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the labels of the tiles and 'X' is the empty cell. The string is formed by concatenating the rows, so the valid input format is 'ABXC' for a 2x2 grid. After executing the function body, the function returns the set 'visited' which contains all unique reachable states from the initial state 'start'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `start` representing the initial state of a 2x2 sliding puzzle and return a set containing all unique reachable states from the initial state.
