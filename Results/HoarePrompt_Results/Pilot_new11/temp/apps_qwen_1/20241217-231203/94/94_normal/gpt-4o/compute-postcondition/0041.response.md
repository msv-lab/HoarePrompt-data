`current` is assigned the value returned by `queue.popleft()`, which removes and returns the leftmost element of `queue`. The value of `queue` is now the queue without its leftmost element. 

Output State: **`queue` is not empty except for its leftmost element which is no longer in the queue; `current` is equal to the leftmost element that was removed from `queue`.**
