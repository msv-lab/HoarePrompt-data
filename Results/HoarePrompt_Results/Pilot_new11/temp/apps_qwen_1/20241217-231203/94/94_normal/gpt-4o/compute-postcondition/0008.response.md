The code `new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc` calculates the new row and column positions by adding the respective delta row (`dr`) and delta column (`dc`) values to the current `empty_row` and `empty_col` values. However, the specific values of `dr`, `dc`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are not provided in the initial state. We know that these values are part of the valid moves for the puzzle.

Since we don't have the specific values of `dr`, `dc`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col`, we can express the output state in terms of these variables:

- `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`
- `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` must not be empty, directions is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`**
