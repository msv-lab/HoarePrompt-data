Postcondition: ***`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` with the elements at positions `new_pos` and `empty_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` list, and either `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`, or the state remains unchanged if `new_state_str` is already in `visited`.***
