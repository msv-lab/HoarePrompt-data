The code adds the value of `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. This means that `new_state_str` is no longer available for future operations since it has been added to the set. However, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `new_pos` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the concatenated characters of the `new_state` list, and `new_state_str` is in `visited`.**
