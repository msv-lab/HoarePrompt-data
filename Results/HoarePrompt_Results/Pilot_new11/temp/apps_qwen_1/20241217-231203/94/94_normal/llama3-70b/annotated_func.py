#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings consisting of four characters each, where the characters are either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', representing a 2x2 grid configuration for Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles respectively. Each string contains exactly one 'X', and the characters 'A', 'B', and 'C' appear exactly once each in their respective strings.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True if `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` contain the same characters in any order, otherwise False. The indices `x1` and `x2` remain unchanged, and the 'X' characters in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` have been swapped.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two strings `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each consisting of four characters where one character is 'X' and the other three are 'A', 'B', and 'C'. It first identifies the index of the 'X' character in both strings. Then, it swaps the positions of the 'X' character in `puzzle1` with the 'X' character in `puzzle2`. After performing the swap, the function checks if the remaining characters in both strings (`puzzle1` and `puzzle2`) are the same in any order. If they are the same, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function ensures that the indices `x1` and `x2` remain unchanged.
