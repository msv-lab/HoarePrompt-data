According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:

- `directions` is a non-empty list.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
- `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`.
- `current` is the final state obtained by performing all valid moves in `directions` starting from the original `current` state.
- `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.
- `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`.
- `visited` is a set containing the string representations of all unique states encountered during the execution of the loop.
- `queue` is a list containing the string representations of all states generated during the loop execution that are not yet in `visited`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `queue` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `queue` is non-empty.

State: **`directions` is a non-empty list, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `current` is the final state obtained by performing all valid moves in `directions` starting from the original `current` state, `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representing the joined elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing the string representations of all unique states encountered during the execution of the loop, and `queue` must be non-empty**.
