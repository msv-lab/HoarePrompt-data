The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` impacts the program by creating a new string `new_state_str` by joining all elements in the `new_state` list. The values of `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, and `new_state` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list created from `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string created by joining all elements in `new_state`.**
