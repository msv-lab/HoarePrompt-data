To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition under which the `while` loop continues: the condition is that the `queue` is not empty.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `queue` is not empty.
2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `queue` contains all possible reachable states from the initial state `start` that have not been visited.
   - `visited` contains all previously visited states.
   - `directions` remains as `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.
   - `empty_row` is the row index of the empty space in the current state.
   - `empty_col` is the column index of the empty space in the current state.
   - `empty_pos` remains as `empty_row * 2 + empty_col`.
   - `current` is the leftmost element of `queue` before each iteration.
   - `new_row` and `new_col` are the new positions of the empty space based on the direction `(dr, dc)`.
   - `new_pos` is the position index of the new state.
   - `new_state` is a list of the current state with the empty space moved to the new position.
   - `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`.
   - If a new state is not in `visited`, it is added to both `visited` and `queue`. If a new state is already in `visited`, it is not added again.

3. **Adjustments Needed**: For the loop to execute one more time, the `queue` must not be empty after the current iteration. Since `queue` is modified inside the loop by adding new states, we need to ensure that there is at least one state left in `queue`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the condition of the `queue` not being empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`queue` is not empty**
