Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two strings `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, each consisting of four characters where one character is 'X' and the other three are 'A', 'B', and 'C'. It first identifies the index of the 'X' character in both strings. Then, it swaps the positions of the 'X' character in `puzzle1` with the 'X' character in `puzzle2`. After performing the swap, the function checks if the remaining characters in both strings (`puzzle1` and `puzzle2`) are the same in any order. If they are the same, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function ensures that the indices `x1` and `x2` remain unchanged.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `puzzle1` or `puzzle2` does not follow the specified format (i.e., contains more than one 'X', or fewer than four characters), the function may behave unpredictably since it relies on these conditions being met. However, the code does not explicitly handle such cases, so it would raise an error if the input does not meet the requirements.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit validation to ensure that `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` meet the specified conditions before proceeding with the operations. This means that the function could potentially crash or produce incorrect results if the input strings do not conform to the expected format.
