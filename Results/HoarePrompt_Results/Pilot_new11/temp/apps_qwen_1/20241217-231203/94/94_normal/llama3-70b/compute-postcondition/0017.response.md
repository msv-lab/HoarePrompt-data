Output State: **`puzzle1` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `puzzle2` is a string consisting of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices of both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`.
- `x1` is set to the index of 'X' in `puzzle1` when the loop finds 'X' for the first time.
- Similarly, `x2` is set to the index of 'X' in `puzzle2` when the loop finds 'X' for the first time.
- Once 'X' is found in `puzzle1` or `puzzle2`, the loop stops executing, and the values of `x1` and `x2` are fixed.
- Since each string contains exactly one 'X', the loop will execute at most once per string.
- After the loop completes, `x1` will hold the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` will hold the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is that `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1` and `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.
