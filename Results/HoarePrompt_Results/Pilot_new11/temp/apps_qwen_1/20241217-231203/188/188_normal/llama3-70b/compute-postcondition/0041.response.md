The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or condition it was part of. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 1, `a1` is the value of `i` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is the value of `i`, and `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
