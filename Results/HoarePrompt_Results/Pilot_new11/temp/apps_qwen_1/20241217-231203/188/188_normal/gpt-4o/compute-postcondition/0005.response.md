The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. It does not affect any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the output to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `count` is a dictionary-like object counting the occurrences of each element in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers from `cards`, sorted based on their counts in ascending order, and the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2; printed output is 'NO'**
