Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive, `count` is a dictionary-like object counting the occurrences of each element in `cards`, `unique_numbers` is a list of the unique numbers from `cards`, sorted based on their counts in ascending order, and the length of `unique_numbers` is at least 2. The current value of `count[unique_numbers[-1]]` is equal to `n // 2` and the current value of `count[unique_numbers[-2]]` is equal to `n // 2`***
