The value of `i` is the first element of the list `a`. The code increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. The states of the other variables and the list `a` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1**
