Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`. If `c` equals 0, `a1` is the value of the next key from the dictionary `d`, `a2` is the value of the next key from the dictionary `d` after the current value of `i`, and `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`. If `c` equals 3, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` (the next key from `d`), and `a2` is the value of the next key from the dictionary `d` after the current value of `i`.**
