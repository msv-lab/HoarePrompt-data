Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
- For each element `i` in `a`, it checks if `i` is already a key in the dictionary `d`.
- If `i` is already a key in `d`, it increments the corresponding value by 1.
- If `i` is not a key in `d`, it adds `i` as a new key with a value of 1.

After all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `d` will contain each unique element from the list `a` as a key, and the value associated with each key will be the count of how many times that element appears in the list `a`.

In the case where the loop does not execute (which is not possible given the initial state conditions), the values of the variables would remain as specified in the initial state:
- `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, where `n` is an even number between 2 and 100.
- `d` is an empty dictionary.
