Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where there are multiple distinct numbers, but they do not appear equally distributed between the players. Specifically, the program only checks if there exists a number that appears exactly half the time, which is insufficient to ensure that both players can take all cards with an equal number of cards each.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

The program will output "NO", which is incorrect. According to the problem description, Petya and Vasya can choose the numbers 1 and 2 (or 1 and 3), and each will get three cards, making the game fair.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there are at least two distinct numbers and ensure that each number appears exactly half the total number of cards. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    
    # Check if there are at least two distinct numbers and each appears exactly half the time
    numbers = list(d.keys())
    if len(numbers) < 2 or any(d[num] != n // 2 for num in numbers):
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(numbers[0], numbers[1])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies whether the game can be made fair by checking if there are at least two distinct numbers that appear exactly half the total number of cards.
