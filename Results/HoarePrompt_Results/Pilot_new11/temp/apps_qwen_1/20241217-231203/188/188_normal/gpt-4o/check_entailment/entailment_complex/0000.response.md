Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Petya and Vasya can choose numbers to ensure a fair game according to the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of cards and then reads `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   
2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each number in the list of cards.

3. **Sorting Unique Numbers**:
   - It sorts the unique numbers based on their counts in ascending order.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if there are at least two unique numbers.
   - If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it prints "NO" immediately, as it's impossible to form a fair game.
   - If there are at least two unique numbers, it checks if the last two unique numbers have the same count and if this count is exactly `n // 2`.
     - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" followed by the two numbers.
     - If either condition fails, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program implicitly handles the requirement that `n` is even by ensuring the input is valid through the initial `int(input())` and subsequent list comprehension.
   - It also ensures that the numbers on the cards are within the specified range (1 to 100) by the nature of how the input is read and processed.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all necessary conditions and edge cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
