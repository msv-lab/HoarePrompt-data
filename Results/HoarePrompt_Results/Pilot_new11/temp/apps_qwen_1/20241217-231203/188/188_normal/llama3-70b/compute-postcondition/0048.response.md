The `break` statement is used to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect any variable values directly but indicates that we would exit the loop or conditional block if one was present. The variables `a`, `d`, `c`, `a1`, `a2`, and `i` remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 2, `a1` is the value of `i` from the dictionary `d` where the count of occurrences of `i` in `a` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is the value of the next key from the dictionary `d` after the current value of `i`, and `i` is the next key from the dictionary `d`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
