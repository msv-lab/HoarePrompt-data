`a1` is assigned the value of `i`, but the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. The value of `i` could be any index from the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is the value of `i`, `a2` is -1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with exactly `n` elements, `d` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is the value of `i`, `a2` is -1**
