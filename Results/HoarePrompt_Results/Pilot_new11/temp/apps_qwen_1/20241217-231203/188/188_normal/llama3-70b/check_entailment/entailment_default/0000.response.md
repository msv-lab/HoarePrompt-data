Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code assumes that there are exactly two distinct integers in the list that appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. However, the problem description does not specify that there must be exactly two such integers. There could be more than two distinct integers that appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times, or there could be fewer than two such integers, making the game unfair.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
1
2
1
2
```

In this case, both 1 and 2 appear exactly twice, so the game would be fair if either 1 or 2 were chosen by Petya and the other by Vasya. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly and would return "NO".

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where no such integers exist, such as:

```
4
1
1
2
2
```

In this case, there are no integers that appear exactly twice, so the game is inherently unfair, and the code should return "NO". However, the current implementation does not handle this case either.

Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case, and the correct answer is **False**.
