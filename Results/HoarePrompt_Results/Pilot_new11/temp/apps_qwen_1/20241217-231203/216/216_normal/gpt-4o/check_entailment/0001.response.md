Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where there are no lowercase letters in the string. According to the problem description, if the string does not contain any lowercase letters, the output should be `0`. However, the current implementation will not handle this case correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
3
ABC
```

The program will execute as follows:
- It reads `n = 3` and the string `s = 'ABC'`.
- It iterates through each character:
  - 'A' is an uppercase letter, so it clears the current set and resets the count.
  - 'B' is an uppercase letter, so it clears the current set and resets the count.
  - 'C' is an uppercase letter, so it clears the current set and resets the count.
- After the loop, `max_count` will still be `0`, which is the correct output for this case.

However, the program should output `0` in this case, but it will output `0` correctly in this specific run due to the nature of the loop. But it fails to explicitly check if the string has any lowercase letters before proceeding with the loop, which is necessary to return `0` if no lowercase letters are present. A fix would be to add a check at the beginning of the function to see if there are any lowercase letters in the string.
