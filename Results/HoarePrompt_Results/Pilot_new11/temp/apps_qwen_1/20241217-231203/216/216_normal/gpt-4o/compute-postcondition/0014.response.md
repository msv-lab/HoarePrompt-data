`current_count` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `n`, `s`, `max_count`, `current_set`, and `current_count` are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0**
