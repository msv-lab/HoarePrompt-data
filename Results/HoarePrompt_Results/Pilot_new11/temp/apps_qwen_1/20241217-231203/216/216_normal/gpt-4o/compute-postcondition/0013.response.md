`current_set.clear()` clears the contents of the `current_set` set. Since `current_set` was initially an empty set, clearing it does not change its state. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200\), `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0**
