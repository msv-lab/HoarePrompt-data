The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, and `s` is a string of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. After executing the code, `n` will be updated to the integer input, while `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters; `n` is an input integer**
