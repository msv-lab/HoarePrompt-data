The code increments the value of `current_count` by 1. The previous value of `current_count` was 1, so after executing the code, `current_count` will be 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `char`, and `current_set`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200 \); `s` must have at least one character remaining; `char` will be the next character in `s`; `current_set` includes the previous `current_set` and the new `char`; `current_count` is 2**
