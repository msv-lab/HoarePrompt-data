Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The code simply counts the number of lowercase letters in the string and prints the length of the list of indices where the characters are lowercase. However, the problem description requires finding the maximum number of elements in a "pretty set of positions," which involves ensuring that the selected positions do not have any uppercase letters between them and that the letters at those positions are distinct and lowercase.

For example, consider the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```

The code will output `2` because it simply counts the number of lowercase 'a' and 'b' without checking the conditions for a "pretty set." However, the correct output should be `2` for the positions `6` and `8` or `7` and `8`, as these positions contain distinct lowercase letters without any uppercase letters between them.

The code fails to consider the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description, hence it is incorrect.
