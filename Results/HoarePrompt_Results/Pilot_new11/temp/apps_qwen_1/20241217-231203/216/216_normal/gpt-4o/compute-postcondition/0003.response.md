The code creates a new empty set called `current_set`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, or `max_count`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is a string input by the user, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set**
