The code updates the value of `remaining_after_cars` to be `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. We know that `b` is \( b_prev + 1 \). Since `b_prev` is not specified in the initial state, let's denote it as `b_prev`.

- `n` remains an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \).
- `house_cost` remains 1234567.
- `car_cost` remains 123456.
- `computer_cost` remains 1234.
- `remaining_after_houses` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `b` is updated to \( b_prev + 1 \).
- `remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged; `b` is \( b_prev + 1 \); `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_houses` is unchanged; `b` is \( b_prev + 1 \); `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b_prev + 1) * car_cost`.**
