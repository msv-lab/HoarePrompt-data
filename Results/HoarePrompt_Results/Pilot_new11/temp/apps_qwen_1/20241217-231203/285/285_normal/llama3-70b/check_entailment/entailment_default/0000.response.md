Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether Kolya's initial game-coin score \( n \) can be expressed as a sum of multiples of the costs of houses, cars, and computers. The program iterates through all possible values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) within their respective bounds and checks if the equation \( a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n \) holds. If such values exist, it prints 'YES' and exits. If no valid combination is found, it prints 'NO'. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
