The code assigns the value `1234` to the variable `computer_cost`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `house_cost`, or `car_cost`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234**
