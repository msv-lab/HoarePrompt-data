Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \)
   - `house_cost` is 1234567
   - `car_cost` is 123456
   - `computer_cost` is 1234
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`
   - `b` is incremented by 1 in each iteration
   - The loop checks if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` equals 0 and returns 'YES' if true.

2. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `b` from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

3. **Adjust the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `b + 1`.
   - Since `b` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to ensure `b + 1` is within the loop's range.
   - For the loop to continue, `b + 1` must be less than or equal to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

4. **Update the Remaining Values:**
   - `remaining_after_cars` will be updated based on the new value of `b + 1`.
   - `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`

Given the above, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `b` will be incremented to `b + 1`.
- `remaining_after_cars` will be updated to `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`.

So, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`; `b` is `b + 1`; if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` equals 0, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no change to the variables' states.**
