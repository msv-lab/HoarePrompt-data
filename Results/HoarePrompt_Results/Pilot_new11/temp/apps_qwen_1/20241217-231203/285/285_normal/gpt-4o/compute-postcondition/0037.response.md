Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `remaining_after_houses` is updated to the value of `n - a * 1234567`.
- `house_cost` is 1234567.
- `car_cost` is 123456.
- `computer_cost` is 1234.
- The initial condition for `n` is \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \).

### Loop Condition
The loop is defined as:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Determine the Range of `b`:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must be at least 1.

2. **Check the Value of `remaining_after_houses`:**
   - `remaining_after_houses = n - a * 1234567`.
   - To ensure `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is at least 1, `remaining_after_houses` must be at least `car_cost`.

3. **Conditions for `remaining_after_houses`:**
   - `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_houses = n - a * 1234567`.

Given the above analysis, we need to ensure that `remaining_after_houses` is at least `car_cost`.

### Adjusted States

- `n` must satisfy the initial condition: \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \).
- `house_cost` remains 1234567.
- `car_cost` remains 123456.
- `computer_cost` remains 1234.
- `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`, which means \( n - a \times 1234567 \geq 123456 \).

### Final Output State
State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_houses` is `n - a * 1234567` and must be greater than or equal to `car_cost` (123456); `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost` for the new value of `a + 1`**.
