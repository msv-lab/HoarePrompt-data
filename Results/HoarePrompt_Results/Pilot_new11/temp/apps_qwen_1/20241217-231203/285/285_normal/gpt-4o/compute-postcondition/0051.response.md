Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n < (a + 1) \times 1234567 \), `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234, `remaining_after_houses` is `n - a * 1234567`, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * 123456` where `b` is the largest integer such that `remaining_after_cars >= 0` and `remaining_after_cars % 1234 != 0`. The program returns 'YES' if there exists an `a` and `b` such that `remaining_after_cars % 1234 == 0`, otherwise, the program returns 'NO'.**
