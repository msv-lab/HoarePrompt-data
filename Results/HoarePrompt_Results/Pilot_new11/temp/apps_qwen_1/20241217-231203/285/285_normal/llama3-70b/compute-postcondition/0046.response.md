The code snippet `print('YES')` does not affect the values of any variables but simply prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their values from the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \); `b` is an integer between \( 0 \) and \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \), but now `b` is incremented by 1; `c` is the same as its initial value \((n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234; we print 'YES'**
