Functionality: **The function determines whether there exist integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that the equation \(a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n\) holds, where \(n\) is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). It iterates through all possible combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within their respective bounds to check if the equation is satisfied. If such integers exist, it prints 'YES' and exits the program. If no valid combination is found after exhausting all possibilities, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return a value explicitly but modifies the output stream by printing 'YES' or 'NO'.**
