The code `exit()` terminates the program, which means no further code will be executed after this point. Therefore, the variables `a`, `n`, `b`, and `c` remain in their updated states from the last executed line before `exit()`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `total` is 0
- \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 + 1 > 0\) must be satisfied
- `b` is updated to `b + 2`
- `c` is updated to \((n - a \times 1234567 - (b + 2) \times 123456) // 123456 + 1\)
- `print('YES')` has been executed

Since the program exits immediately after these assignments, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`total` is 0, \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 + 1 > 0\), `b` is `b + 2`, `c` is \((n - a \times 1234567 - (b + 2) \times 123456) // 123456 + 1\), and 'YES' has been printed.**
