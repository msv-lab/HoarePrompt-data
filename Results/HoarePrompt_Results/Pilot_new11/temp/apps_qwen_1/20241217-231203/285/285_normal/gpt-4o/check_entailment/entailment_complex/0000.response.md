Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program takes an integer `n` as input, which represents Kolya's initial game-coin score. The input handling is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if there exist non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that:
     \[
     a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 = n
     \]
   - The program iterates over all possible values of `a` (houses) and `b` (cars) to see if the remaining amount (`remaining_after_cars`) can be exactly divided by the cost of a computer (`1234`). This ensures that the condition `remaining_after_cars % 1234 == 0` is met, indicating that `c` (computers) can be purchased without leaving any remainder.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where no combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfies the equation. In such cases, the function returns `'NO'`.

4. **Range and Validity**:
   - The program assumes that the input `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). Since the problem description specifies this range, the program is valid within these constraints.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description and always produces the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
