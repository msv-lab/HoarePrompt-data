The `exit()` function is called, which immediately terminates the program without executing any further code. This means no changes are made to any variables, and the program exits.

Output State: **`a` must satisfy \((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 \geq 0\); `b` is 0; `c` is equal to \((n - a * 1234567) // 1234\); the equation \((a * 1234567 + c * 1234) = n\)**
