To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \)
  - `b` is an integer between \( 0 \) and \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \), inclusive
  - `c` is the same as its initial value \((n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234 \)
  - The loop continues as long as the condition \( (a \times 1234567 + b \times 123456 + c \times 1234 == n) \) does not hold.

- The loop statement:
  ```python
  for b in range((n - a * 1234567) // 123456 + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over values of `b` from \( 0 \) to \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \). This means `b` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the upper limit.
2. **Post-Iteration State**:
   - After each iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be `current_b + 1`.

### Adjusted States
- `a` remains the same because the value of `a` is determined at the beginning and does not change within the loop.
- `b` is incremented by 1.
- `c` remains the same because its value is determined based on the initial values of `a` and `b`, and it does not change during the loop.

### New State
State: **`a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \); `b` is an integer between \( 0 \) and \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \), but now `b` is incremented by 1; `c` is the same as its initial value \((n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234 \)**

Thus, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \); `b` is an integer between \( 0 \) and \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \), but now `b` is incremented by 1; `c` is the same as its initial value \((n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234 \)**
