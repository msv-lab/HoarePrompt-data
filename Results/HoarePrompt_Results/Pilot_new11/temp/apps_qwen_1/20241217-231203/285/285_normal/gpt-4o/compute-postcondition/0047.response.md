`remaining_after_cars` is updated to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The value of `b` is incremented by 1 in the previous line. The value of `n` and other variables are not directly affected, so they remain as per the initial state.

Since `remaining_after_houses` and `b` are not specified in the initial state, we can denote them symbolically. The only change is in `remaining_after_cars`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( n < ((a + 1) + 1) \times 1234567 \); `house_cost` is 1234567; `car_cost` is 123456; `computer_cost` is 1234; `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`; `b` is `b + 1`**
