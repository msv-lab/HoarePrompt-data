Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \)
   - `b` is an integer between \( 0 \) and \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \) but incremented by 1
   - `c` is \((n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234\)

2. **Determine the loop condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` from \( 0 \) to \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \) but incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `b` was incremented by 1, meaning it is now \( b + 1 \).

3. **Check the loop's range:**
   - The loop continues as long as \( b \) is within the range from \( 0 \) to \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456 \).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be within this range.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - `a` remains unchanged since it is derived from `n`.
   - `b` is incremented by 1, so it becomes \( b + 1 \).
   - `c` remains unchanged because it depends on the current values of `a` and `b`, and there is no indication that it should change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \)
- `b` is \( b + 1 \)
- `c` is \((n - a \times 1234567 - (b + 1) \times 123456) // 1234\)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is \( n // 1234567 + 1 \); `b` is \( b + 1 \); `c` is \((n - a \times 1234567 - (b + 1) \times 123456) // 1234\)**
