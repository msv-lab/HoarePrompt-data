According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n // house_cost + 1`. The loop will execute if `n // house_cost + 1` is at least 1. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `n // house_cost + 1`:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n // house_cost + 1` must be greater than 0.
   - This means `n // house_cost` must be at least 0.
   - Given that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), we need to consider the smallest possible value of `n` that would make `n // house_cost` at least 1.

2. **Calculating the minimum value of `n` for the loop to execute:**
   - Since `house_cost` is 1234567, the smallest value of `n` that makes `n // house_cost` at least 1 is \(1234567 \times 1 = 1234567\).
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 1234567 to ensure that `n // house_cost` is at least 1, making `n // house_cost + 1` at least 1.

3. **Initial state of other variables:**
   - `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` do not affect the loop condition directly, but they remain as given.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 1234567 to ensure the loop can execute.
- The values of `house_cost`, `car_cost`, and `computer_cost` remain as provided.

State: **`n` is at least 1234567, `house_cost` is 1234567, `car_cost` is 123456, `computer_cost` is 1234**
