Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is an integer such that it must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \).
   - The program checks if `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` equals 0 and returns 'YES' if true. Otherwise, it does not return anything.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `b` ranges from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented and the condition for the next iteration must still hold true.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is one less than its maximum value, which is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be set to the next value, i.e., `b = remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
   - Since the loop variable `b` does not affect the conditions related to `n`, `remaining_after_cars`, or `computer_cost`, these conditions remain unchanged.

5. **Final State:**
   - The only state that needs adjustment is `b`, which should be set to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

**State: **`n` is an integer such that it must be at least \( a \times 1234567 \), `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` must equal 0, `remaining_after_houses` remains the same, `car_cost` remains the same, `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.**
