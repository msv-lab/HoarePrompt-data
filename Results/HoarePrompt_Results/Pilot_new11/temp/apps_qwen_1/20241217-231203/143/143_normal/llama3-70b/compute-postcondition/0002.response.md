The code initializes a list `dp` with `float('inf')` repeated `L + 1` times. The length of this list is `L + 1`. The values of `n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements all initialized to `float('inf')`**
