The code `dp[0] = 0` initializes the first element of the list `dp` to 0. The other elements of `dp` remain unchanged, and all are still initialized to `float('inf')`. The variables `n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements with the first element set to 0 and the rest set to `float('inf')`**
