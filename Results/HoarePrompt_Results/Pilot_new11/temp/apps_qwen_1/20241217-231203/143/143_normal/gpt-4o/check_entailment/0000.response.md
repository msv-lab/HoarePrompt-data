Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement a solution to the problem. It uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads input and initializes the `dp` array with a large value (`10 ** 18`) and the costs of bottles up to 30 types.
2. **Base Cases**: It sets the base cost for the first type of bottle.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: It fills the `dp` array to represent the minimum cost to get at least `2^i` liters of lemonade.
4. **Cost Calculation**: It iterates from the largest possible bottle size down to the smallest, updating the `dp` values based on whether it's more cost-effective to buy a larger bottle or double the previous size.
5. **Final Calculation**: It calculates the total cost by summing up the necessary bottle costs to meet or exceed `L` liters.

This approach ensures that the program finds the minimum cost efficiently by considering both buying a larger bottle and doubling the previous size. Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles various cases correctly.
