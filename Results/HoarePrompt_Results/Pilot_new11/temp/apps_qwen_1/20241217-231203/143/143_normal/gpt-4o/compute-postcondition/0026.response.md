`current_cost` is incremented by `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is 29, `dp[i]` is the minimum of the original `dp[29]` and `c[29]`, and `current_cost` is initially `dp[29]`, the new value of `current_cost` will be `dp[29] + dp[29]`, which simplifies to `2 * dp[29]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 29; `dp[29]` is the minimum of the original `dp[29]` and `c[29]`; `current_cost` is `2 * dp[29]`; `L` is `L - 2^29` unless `L <= 0` in which case it remains 0; `answer` is updated based on the condition in the code.

Output State: **`i` is 29; `dp[29]` is the minimum of the original `dp[29]` and `c[29]`; `current_cost` is `2 * dp[29]`; `L` is `L - 2^29` unless `L <= 0` in which case it remains 0; `answer` is updated based on the condition in the code.**
