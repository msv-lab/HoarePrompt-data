According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop condition is `for j in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` remains the same.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`. Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, if `j` is currently 1, it needs to become 2 to enter the next iteration.

The states related to `j` need to be adjusted accordingly, but other states (`vol`, `dp[i]`, `L`, `c`, and `costs`) remain unchanged because the problem does not indicate that these variables are modified within the loop body.

State: **`j` is 2, `vol` is 1, `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[1])`, `n` remains the same, `L` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `costs` remains the same**
