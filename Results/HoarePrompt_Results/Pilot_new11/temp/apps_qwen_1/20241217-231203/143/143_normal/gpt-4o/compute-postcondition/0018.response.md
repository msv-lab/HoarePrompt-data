The variable `current_cost` is assigned the value `0`. This initializes `current_cost` but does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` must be at least 2, `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`, ..., `dp[30]` is the minimum of the original `dp[30]` and `c[30]`, `dp[i]` for \( i \) from 1 to 30 is updated to be the minimum of `dp[i]` and \( 2^{(i-1)} \times \text{original\_dp[0]} \), `answer` is equal to `max_cost`, `current_cost` is 0.**
