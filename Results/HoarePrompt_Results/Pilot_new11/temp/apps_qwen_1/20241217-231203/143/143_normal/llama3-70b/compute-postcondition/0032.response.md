Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` must be at least 1; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\); `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i` using the given items; if `vol <= i`, `dp[3]` is updated to `dp[3] + costs[0]` (or remains unchanged if `dp[3]` is less than or equal to `dp[3] + costs[0]`).***
