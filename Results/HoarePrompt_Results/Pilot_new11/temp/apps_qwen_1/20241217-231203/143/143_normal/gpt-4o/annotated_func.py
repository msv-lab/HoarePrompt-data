#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of a specific type (1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`, `current_cost` is the sum of all `dp[i]` where `i` is from 0 to 30 and satisfies the condition `L >= 1 << i`, `L` is 0, `answer` is the minimum value of `current_cost + dp[0]` when `L == 0` and `current_cost + dp[0] + dp[i]` for each `i` from 0 to 30 where `L >= 1 << i`.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum value of `current_cost + dp[0]` when `L == 0` and `current_cost + dp[0] + dp[i]` for each `i` from 0 to 30 where `L >= 1 << i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 30), `L` (a positive integer up to \(10^9\)), and `costs` (a list of `n` positive integers representing the cost of bottles). It computes the minimum cost to buy a certain number of bottles such that the total quantity is exactly `L`. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and updates it based on the given costs and a modified version of `costs`. It then iterates backward through `dp` to determine the minimum cost by considering the maximum possible quantities that can be bought without exceeding `L`. The function returns the minimum cost found.
