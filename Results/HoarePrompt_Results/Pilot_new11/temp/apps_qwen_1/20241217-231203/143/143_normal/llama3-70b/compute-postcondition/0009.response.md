Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `L` must be at least 1, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\), `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements with the first element set to 0 and the rest set to `float('inf')`, `vol` is 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to `min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[0])` if `vol <= i`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
