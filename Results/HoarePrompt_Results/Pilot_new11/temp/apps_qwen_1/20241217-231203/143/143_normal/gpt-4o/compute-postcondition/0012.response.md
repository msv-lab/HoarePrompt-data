According to the given for loop, the loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to 30. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be at least 2. The loop body updates the `dp` array such that each `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

Additionally, `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue. There are no other changes needed to the states based on the information provided.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`, ..., `dp[n-1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[n-1]` and `c[n-1]`**
