According to the given for loop statement, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop condition `i < n` must be true for the loop to continue. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`. Additionally, the loop will continue if `2 < n` is still true.

Since `n` is within the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`, it is safe to assume that the loop will continue unless `n` is explicitly changed to a value that does not satisfy `2 < n`. However, based on the information provided, we can only increment `i` and update its value to 2.

Given the loop body is omitted, no changes are made to `dp[0]`, `dp[1]`, or `c[1]`.

State: **`i` is 2; `dp[0]` is `c[0]`; `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `c[1]`; `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`**
