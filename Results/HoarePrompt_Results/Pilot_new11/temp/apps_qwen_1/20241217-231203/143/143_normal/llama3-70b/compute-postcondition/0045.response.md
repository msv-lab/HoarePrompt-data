`vol` is assigned the value `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `vol` becomes `2 ** 2 - 1`, which is `4 - 1`, resulting in `vol` being 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `L` must be at least 1; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\); `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[4]` is updated to `min(dp[4], dp[3] + costs[1])`; `j` is 2; `i` is 4; `vol` is 3.
