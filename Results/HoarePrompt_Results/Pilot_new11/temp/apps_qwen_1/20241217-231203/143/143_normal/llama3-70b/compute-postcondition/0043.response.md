Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0; `L` must be at least 1; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\); `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[4]` is updated to `min(dp[4], dp[3] + costs[1])`; `j` is 1; `i` is 4; `vol` is 1.***
