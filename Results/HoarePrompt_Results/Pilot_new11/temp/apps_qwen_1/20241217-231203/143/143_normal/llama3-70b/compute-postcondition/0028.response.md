Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` must be at least 1; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\); `costs` is a list of `n` integers read from input; `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[i]` contains the minimum cost to achieve a volume of `i` using the given items; `j` is `n - 2`; `i` is 3; `vol` is \(2^{(n-2)} - 1\); `dp[3]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[3 - (2^{(n-2)} - 1)] + costs[n-2]` if `vol <= i`. Otherwise, `dp[3]` remains unchanged.***
