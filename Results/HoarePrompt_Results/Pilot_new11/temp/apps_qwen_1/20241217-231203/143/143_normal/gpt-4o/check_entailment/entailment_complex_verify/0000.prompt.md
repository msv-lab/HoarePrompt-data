You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.

Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2^{i} - 1 liters and costs c_{i} roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.

You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.

The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.


-----Examples-----

Output
44981600785557577



-----Note-----

In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.

In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.

In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
    return answer


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement a solution to the problem. It uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to buy at least `L` liters of lemonade. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads input and initializes the `dp` array with a large value (`10 ** 18`) and the costs of bottles up to 30 types.
2. **Base Cases**: It sets the base cost for the first type of bottle.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: It fills the `dp` array to represent the minimum cost to get at least `2^i` liters of lemonade.
4. **Cost Calculation**: It iterates from the largest possible bottle size down to the smallest, updating the `dp` values based on whether it's more cost-effective to buy a larger bottle or double the previous size.
5. **Final Calculation**: It calculates the total cost by summing up the necessary bottle costs to meet or exceed `L` liters.

This approach ensures that the program finds the minimum cost efficiently by considering both buying a larger bottle and doubling the previous size. Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles various cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    L = int(data[1])
    costs = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
    print(func_1(n, L, costs))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, L is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9, and costs is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of a specific type (1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(n, L, costs):
    max_cost = 10 ** 18
    dp = [max_cost] * 31
    c = costs + [max_cost] * (31 - len(costs))
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], c[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n-1`; `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`; `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`; ...; `dp[n-1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[n-1]` and `c[n-1]`; `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30`.
    for i in range(1, 31):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 30, `n` must be at least 2, `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`, ..., `dp[30]` is the minimum of the original `dp[30]` and `c[30]`, `dp[i]` for \( i \) from 1 to 30 is updated to be the minimum of `dp[i]` and \( 2^{(i-1)} \times \text{original\_dp[0]} \)
    answer = max_cost
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        if L >= 1 << i:
            current_cost += dp[i]
            L -= 1 << i
        
        answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`, `current_cost` is the sum of all `dp[i]` where `i` is from 0 to 30 and satisfies the condition `L >= 1 << i`, `L` is 0, `answer` is the minimum value of `current_cost + dp[0]` when `L == 0` and `current_cost + dp[0] + dp[i]` for each `i` from 0 to 30 where `L >= 1 << i`.
    return answer
    #The program returns the minimum value of `current_cost + dp[0]` when `L == 0` and `current_cost + dp[0] + dp[i]` for each `i` from 0 to 30 where `L >= 1 << i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 30), `L` (a positive integer up to \(10^9\)), and `costs` (a list of `n` positive integers representing the cost of bottles). It computes the minimum cost to buy a certain number of bottles such that the total quantity is exactly `L`. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and updates it based on the given costs and a modified version of `costs`. It then iterates backward through `dp` to determine the minimum cost by considering the maximum possible quantities that can be bought without exceeding `L`. The function returns the minimum cost found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
