Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It uses a DP array to keep track of the minimum cost to achieve each volume from 0 to L liters. The program iterates through each possible volume up to L and updates the DP array by considering the cost of each bottle type. This ensures that the solution accounts for all possible ways to reach the required volume while minimizing the cost. The program handles all the given examples correctly and appears to cover all potential cases efficiently.
