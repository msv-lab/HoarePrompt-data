The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 3
- `n` must be at least 2
- `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`
- `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`
- `dp[2]` is the minimum of the original `dp[2]` and `dp[1] * 2`

Since `i` is 3, the relevant part of the code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` translates to `dp[3] = min(dp[3], dp[2] * 2)`. However, `dp[3]` is not defined in the initial state, so it remains undefined. But the value of `dp[3]` will now be updated based on the value of `dp[2]`.

Given `dp[2]` is the minimum of the original `dp[2]` and `dp[1] * 2`, let's denote this value as `dp[2] = min(original_dp[2], original_dp[1] * 2)`. 

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[3]` will be:
- `dp[3] = min(dp[3], dp[2] * 2)`

Since `dp[3]` was initially undefined, it will take the value of `min(dp[3], dp[2] * 2)`. Given that `dp[2]` is `min(original_dp[2], original_dp[1] * 2)`, the final value of `dp[3]` will be `min(dp[3], (min(original_dp[2], original_dp[1] * 2)) * 2)`.

The output state will include the updated value of `dp[3]` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `dp[0]` is the minimum of the original `dp[0]` and `c[0]`, `dp[1]` is the minimum of the original `dp[1]` and `c[1]`, `dp[2]` is the minimum of the original `dp[2]` and `dp[1] * 2`, `dp[3]` is `min(dp[3], (min(original_dp[2], original_dp[1] * 2)) * 2)`**
