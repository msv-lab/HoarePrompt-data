Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is 0
   - `n` is the length of `s`
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'
   - `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged
   - `beauty` is either 3 (if `s[0]` is 'G') or 2 (if `s[0]` is not 'G')

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `j = i - 1` down to `j = 0`. So, for the loop to continue, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is 0 (meaning the loop has already completed its first iteration)

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decreased by 1 from the current value of `i - 1`.
   - Since `i` is 3, the next value of `j` would be `i - 1 - 1 = 2`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop: `i` is still 3.
   - `j` is now 2 (one step closer to satisfying the loop condition).

6. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `total` is not mentioned in the initial states and is not modified by the loop, so it remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains 3.
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `n` remains the length of `s`.
   - `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
   - `golden` remains the same as it contains all indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `max_beauty` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged.
   - `beauty` remains either 3 or 2 based on the initial value of `s[0]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged, `beauty` is either 3 (if `s[0]` is 'G') or 2 (if `s[0]` is not 'G')**.
