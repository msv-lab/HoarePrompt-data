To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the information given and the loop itself:

### Given Information:
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`.
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after 4.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`.
- `beauty` is 1.

### Loop:
```
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i = 4`
   - `beauty = 1`

2. **Range of the For Loop**:
   - The loop runs over `range(i - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it will iterate over values of `j` from `i-1` (which is 3) down to 0.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range specified by `range(i - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `j` must be between 0 and 3 inclusive.

4. **Required States for Loop Execution**:
   - `i` should be set to 4.
   - `j` should be initialized to the last 'G' index in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`. Since `i` is 4, `j` should be the largest index in `golden` that is less than or equal to 2 (since `j` is supposed to be at least 2 positions before `i`).
   - The range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` needs to be valid, meaning there must be some 'G' in `s` such that `j` is within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be 4.
- `j` should be initialized to the last 'G' index in `s` that is at least 2 positions before `i`, which means `j` should be the largest index in `golden` that is less than or equal to 2.
- The range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` must be valid, which means there must be at least one 'G' in `s` such that `j` is within the specified range.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 4, `j` is the largest index in `golden` that is less than or equal to 2, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`, and the range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` must be valid**.
