The code `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` updates the value of `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. Since the initial value of `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 0, which means `max_beauty` will remain unchanged unless `curr_beauty` was greater than the current `max_beauty`.

Given the initial state, the variables `left`, `right`, `s`, `golden`, and `curr_beauty` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`left` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` or the length of `s` if no 'G' is found, `right` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is 0**
