Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `left` is 0
   - `right` is 1
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'
   - If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `left` becomes 2, `right` becomes 2, `s[0]` must be 'S', `s[1]` must not be 'G', and `s[2]` must be 'G'.
   - If `left < right`, `curr_beauty` is increased by 1.

2. **Determine Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `right` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `right` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `right` will become 2.

3. **Check the Condition `left < right`**:
   - Initially, `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, so `left < right` is true.
   - After the first iteration, if `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is 2.
   - If `s[right]` is 'S', then `left` and `right` both become 2, and `s[0]` must be 'S', `s[1]` must not be 'G', and `s[2]` must be 'G'.

4. **Adjust States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `right` is currently 1, for the next iteration, `right` will be 2.
   - We need to check the value of `s[2]`:
     - If `s[2]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` will remain 2.
     - If `s[2]` is 'S', then `left` becomes 2, `right` becomes 2, `s[0]` must be 'S', `s[1]` must not be 'G', and `s[2]` must be 'G'.
   - Given that `left` and `right` are equal (both are 2), the condition `left < right` is no longer true, so `curr_beauty` will not be incremented.

5. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - `left` remains 2 (if `s[2]` is 'S')
   - `right` becomes 2
   - `s[0]` must be 'S'
   - `s[1]` must not be 'G'
   - `s[2]` must be 'G'

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`left` is 2, `right` is 2, `s` is a string where `s[0]` is 'S', `s[1]` is not 'G', and `s[2]` is 'G'**.
