Postcondition: ***`i` is 4, `j` is 7, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its current value and the final value of `beauty`. If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `beauty` is incremented by 1 if a consecutive sequence of 'G's starting from `j` up to but not including `i` is found, otherwise it remains unchanged.***
