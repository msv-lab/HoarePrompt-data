`beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, as do the conditions regarding `s`. The initial state is that `i` is 4, `j` is the largest index in `golden` that is less than or equal to 2, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`, and the range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` is valid. The value of `s[j]` remains 'G'.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is the largest index in `golden` that is less than or equal to 2, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`, the range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` is valid, `s[j]` is 'G', and `beauty` is increased by 1.**
