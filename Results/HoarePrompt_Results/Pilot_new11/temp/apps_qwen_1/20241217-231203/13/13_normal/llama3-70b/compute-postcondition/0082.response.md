The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we exit the context where this statement would be evaluated.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` must be in the range (4, n), `n` must be at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` must contain at least one index in the range [4, n-1), and `beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise `beauty` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
