The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Initially, `left` was 1, so now it becomes 2. The values of `right` and `s` remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `s[0]` must be 'S', and `s[1]` must not be 'G'**
