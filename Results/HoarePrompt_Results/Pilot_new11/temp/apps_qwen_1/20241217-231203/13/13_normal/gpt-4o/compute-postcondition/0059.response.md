The code updates the value of `max_length` by calculating the maximum between its current value and the value of `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. Since `max_length` was initially set to 9, the new value of `max_length` will be the maximum of 9 and the calculated expression.

Let's denote:
- `curr_end - curr_start + 1` as `length_of_current_segment`
- `prev_end - prev_start + 1` as `length_of_previous_segment`

So, the expression becomes `max_length = max(9, length_of_current_segment + length_of_previous_segment + 2)`.

Since the exact values of `curr_start`, `curr_end`, `prev_start`, and `prev_end` are not given, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `max_length`. However, we know it will be the maximum of 9 and the sum of the lengths of the current and previous segments plus 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S'; `segments` is a list containing tuples of the form `(start, end)` representing segments of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`; `i` is 2; `segments` is populated with at least one segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`; `len(segments) > 1`; `prev_start` is the start of the second segment in `segments`; `prev_end` is the end of the second segment in `segments`; `curr_start` is the start of the third segment in `segments`; `curr_end` is the end of the third segment in `segments`; `max_length` is the maximum of 9 and `length_of_current_segment + length_of_previous_segment + 2`.**
