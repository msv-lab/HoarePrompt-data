The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Since `beauty` was initially 2, it will now be 3. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `j` is within the valid range (0 to n-1), `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is 2, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `beauty` is 3**
