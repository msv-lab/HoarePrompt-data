Postcondition: ***`i` is 4, `j` is the largest index in `golden` that is less than or equal to 2, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`, and the range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` is valid. If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is not 'G', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
