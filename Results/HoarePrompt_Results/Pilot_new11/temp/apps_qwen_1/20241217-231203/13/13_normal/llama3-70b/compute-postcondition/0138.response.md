`beauty` is assigned the value of `1` and added to its current value. The value of `i` is 4, `j` is 0, and `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`. Since no other variables are affected, the updated value of `beauty` is `1` more than its previous value.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 0, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`, `beauty` is 1 more than its previous value**
