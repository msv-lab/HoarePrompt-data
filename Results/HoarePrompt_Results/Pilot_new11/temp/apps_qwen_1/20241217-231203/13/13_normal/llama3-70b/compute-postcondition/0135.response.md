The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, or `s`. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match case, which is not present in the given initial state. Therefore, the values of `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is 1, `s` must contain at least one 'G' at an index that satisfies the condition for `j`, and the range `range(i - 1, -1, -1)` is valid.**
