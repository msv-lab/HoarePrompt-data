The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or condition we are currently inside. However, the given code snippet does not specify which loop or condition this `break` belongs to. Since no specific loop or condition is mentioned, the variables outside of any loop or condition will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 10, `i` is 2, `j` is within the valid range (0 to n-1), `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is 1, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `beauty` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `s` is not 'G'; we break out of the most internal loop or condition.
