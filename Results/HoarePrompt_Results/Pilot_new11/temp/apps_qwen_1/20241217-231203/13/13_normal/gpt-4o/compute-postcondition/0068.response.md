The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.

Based on the output cases:

- **Case_1:** The function returns 0.
- **Case_2:** The function returns `max_length`, which is the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in the string `trophies`.
- **Case_3:** The function returns the minimum value between `max_length + 1` and `n`, where `max_length` is the maximum length of any segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` where the start of the next segment is exactly 2 positions ahead of the end of the previous segment, and `n` is the length of the list `segments`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies` and return either 0, the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, or the minimum value between this maximum length plus one and the length of the list `segments`, depending on the specific conditions outlined in the cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) and `trophies` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S'), and returns 0, the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, or the minimum value between this maximum length plus one and `n` based on specific conditions.**
