Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is at least 5 (this means \( j \geq 5 \))
   - `n` is the length of `s`
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S'
   - `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`
   - `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started
   - `beauty` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop runs for `j` values starting from `i + 2` up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

3. **State Update**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is at least 5.
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be increased by 1, so `j` would be 6.
   - `i` remains 3 because it does not change within the loop.
   - `n` remains the same because it is the length of the string `s`.
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `golden` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` remain unchanged unless they are updated within the loop, but since no update is mentioned, they stay the same.
   - `beauty` could be updated depending on the value of `s[j]` but since we don't know the exact condition, we assume it remains unchanged unless specified.

Given these points, let's summarize the new state for the next iteration:

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is at least 6, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started, and `beauty` is updated as follows: if `s[j] == 'G'`, `beauty` is incremented by 1; if `s[j] != 'G'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
