The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the constraints, it seems the function might be part of a larger context where an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S' are provided as input. The function's output depends on these inputs, but since they are not passed as arguments to the function, we will focus on describing the expected inputs and the possible return values.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we can infer the function might be evaluating the string to determine the count or type of trophies ('G' for golden, 'S' for silver) and returning a specific value based on that evaluation.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S' as input and returns a value based on the count or type of trophies in the string.**
