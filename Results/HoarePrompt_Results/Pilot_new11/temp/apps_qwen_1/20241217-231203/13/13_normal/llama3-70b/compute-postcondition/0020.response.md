`curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The value of `curr_beauty` was previously 0, so now it is 1. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to `right`, `s[left-1]` is 'G', `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 1, and the condition `left < right` is true.

Output State: **`left` is equal to `right`, `s[left-1]` is 'G', `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and 1, `curr_beauty` is 1, and the condition `left < right` is true.**
