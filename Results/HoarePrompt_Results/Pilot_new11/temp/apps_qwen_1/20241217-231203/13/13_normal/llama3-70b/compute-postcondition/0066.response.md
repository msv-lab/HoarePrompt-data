The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Given the initial state, `beauty` is 1 if `s[j]` is not 'G', otherwise `beauty` is 3. Since `s[j]` is the character at index `j` in the string `s`, and `j` is initially 1, let's consider both cases:

- If `s[1]` is 'G', then `beauty` is initially 3. After `beauty += 1`, `beauty` becomes 4.
- If `s[1]` is not 'G', then `beauty` is initially 1. After `beauty += 1`, `beauty` becomes 2.

Since the initial state does not specify whether `s[1]` is 'G' or not 'G', we need to consider both possibilities. However, the problem does not specify the exact value of `s[1]`, so we will present both scenarios.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices where `s` has the character 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's encountered during the loop, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it remains the same, `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, and `beauty` is 4 if `s[1]` is 'G' or 2 if `s[1]` is not 'G'.**
