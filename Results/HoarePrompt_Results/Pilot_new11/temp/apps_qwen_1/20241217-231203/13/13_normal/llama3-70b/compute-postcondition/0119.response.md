`beauty` is incremented by 1, and no other variables are affected. The value of `i` is still 3, `j` is still at least 7, `n` is still the length of `s`, `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` still contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is still the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is still the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started.

Output State: **`beauty` is 2, `i` is 3, `j` is at least 7, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started.**
