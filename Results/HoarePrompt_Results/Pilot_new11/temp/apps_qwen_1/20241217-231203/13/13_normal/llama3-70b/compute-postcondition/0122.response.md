Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is the index of the last 'G' in `s` that is at least 2 positions after `i`, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started, and `beauty` is the count of consecutive 'G's starting from `j` up to `i-2` inclusive, or 1 if no such sequence exists.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the string `s` starting from `i + 2` until it finds an 'S' or reaches the end of the string.
- `beauty` is incremented each time `s[j]` is 'G'.
- The loop breaks if `s[j]` is not 'G'.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be the last index of 'G' that is at least 2 positions after `i`.
- `beauty` will be the count of consecutive 'G's from `j` to `i-2`, or 1 if no such sequence exists.
- The loop will continue to find the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, updating `max_beauty` accordingly.
