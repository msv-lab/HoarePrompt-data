Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `segments` is a list containing tuples of the form `(start, end)` representing segments of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `segments` is populated with at least one segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, `len(segments) > 1`, `prev_start` is the start of the third segment in `segments`, `prev_end` is the end of the third segment in `segments`, `curr_start` is the start of the fourth segment in `segments`, `curr_end` is the end of the fourth segment in `segments`, and `max_length` is the maximum of 9 and either `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1` or 9, depending on whether `curr_start - prev_end == 2` holds true or not.***
