The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables, but it indicates that we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Given the initial state and the fact that no other operations are performed, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is at least 7, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'G' and 'S', `golden` contains all indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's starting from any position in `s` that is at least 2 positions away from the current position of `i`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the value of `max_beauty` when the loop started, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
