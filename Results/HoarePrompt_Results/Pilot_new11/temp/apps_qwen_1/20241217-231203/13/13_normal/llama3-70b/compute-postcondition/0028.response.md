The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `left` is 0, so after the increment, `left` becomes 1. The values of `right` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 1, `right` is 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `s[0]` must be 'S'.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', and `s[0]` must be 'S'**
