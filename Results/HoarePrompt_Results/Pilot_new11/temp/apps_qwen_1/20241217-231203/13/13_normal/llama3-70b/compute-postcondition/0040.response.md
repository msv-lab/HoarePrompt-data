The code snippet `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` does not assign a specific value to `max_beauty` but updates `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. Since `curr_beauty` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `max_beauty` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.

Given the initial state:
- `left` is 2
- `right` is 2
- `s` is a string where `s[0]` is 'S', `s[1]` is not 'G', and `s[2]` is 'G'

Since no other variables are affected, and `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of itself and `curr_beauty`, the output state will be:

Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is 2, `s` is a string where `s[0]` is 'S', `s[1]` is not 'G', and `s[2]` is 'G', `max_beauty` is the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.**
