Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The code counts the number of positions where consecutive characters in the string are different, which is not the same as the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters.

For example, consider the string "aaabbbccc". According to the problem description, the correct number of operations needed to delete the entire string would be 3 (deleting "aaa", "bbb", and "ccc"). However, the provided code would incorrectly count this as 6 because it counts the differences between each pair of consecutive characters.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a stack or a similar method to track and count contiguous substrings of equal characters.
