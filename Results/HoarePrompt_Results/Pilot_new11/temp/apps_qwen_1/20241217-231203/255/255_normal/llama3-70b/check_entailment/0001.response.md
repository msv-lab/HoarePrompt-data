Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for contiguous substrings of equal characters that span across multiple segments of the string. For example, consider the input "aaabbaa". The program will output 4, but the correct answer should be 2 (by deleting "aaa" and then "bba").

Here's a counterexample where the program fails:
- Input:
```
6
aaabba
```
- Expected Output:
```
2
```
- Program Output:
```
4
```

Thus, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string in all cases.
