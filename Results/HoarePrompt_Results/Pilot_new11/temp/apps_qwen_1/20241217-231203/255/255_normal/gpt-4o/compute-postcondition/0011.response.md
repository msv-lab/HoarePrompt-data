`operations` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains `n-1` because the loop will execute one more time, and `i` will be incremented to `n` in the next iteration. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`operations` is equal to the original value plus 1, `i` is `n-1`, and the loop will execute one more time.**
