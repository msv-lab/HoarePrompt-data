Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string. The logic in the program increments `ans` whenever a different character is encountered, which does not account for contiguous substrings of the same character. For example, consider the input `bbbbb`. According to the problem description, the minimum number of operations needed to delete the entire string `bbbbb` is 1 (by deleting the entire substring `bbbbb`). However, the program would incorrectly output 5, as it increments `ans` for each character change. Therefore, the program does not handle the requirement to delete contiguous substrings of the same character effectively.
