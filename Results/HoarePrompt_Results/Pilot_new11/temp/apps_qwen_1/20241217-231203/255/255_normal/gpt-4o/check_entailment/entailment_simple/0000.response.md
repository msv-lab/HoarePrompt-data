Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program increments the `operations` variable whenever it encounters a character in the string `s` that is different from its previous character. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of deleting contiguous substrings where all characters are the same. 

For example, consider the input `abaca`. According to the problem description, the optimal way to delete the string is to perform the following operations:
1. Delete `b`.
2. Delete `a` at position 3.
3. Delete `c` at position 4.
4. Delete `a` at the end.

Thus, the correct answer should be 4 operations. However, the provided program would incorrectly output 3 because it only counts the transitions between different characters, ignoring the possibility of deleting larger contiguous substrings of the same character.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to use a more sophisticated approach, such as iterating through the string and keeping track of the current character and its count, then performing deletions when a different character is encountered or when the count reaches the maximum allowed length for a contiguous substring of the same character.
