`value` is incremented by `q ** (n - i - 1)`. Given the initial values: `q` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 5, the term `q ** (n - i - 1)` simplifies to `5 ** (n - 5 - 1)` or `5 ** (n - 6)`. Since `n` is greater than 5, `n - 6` is a non-negative integer, making the value of `5 ** (n - 6)` a power of 5.

The exact value of `n` is not specified, but the output will be in the form of `value` being the sum of its original value (5) and `5 ** (n - 6)`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is 5, `value` is 5 + 5 ** (n - 6), `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5**
