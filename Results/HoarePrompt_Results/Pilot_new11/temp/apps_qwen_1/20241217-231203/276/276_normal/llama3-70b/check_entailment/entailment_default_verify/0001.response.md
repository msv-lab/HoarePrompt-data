Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the conversion of a golden system number to its decimal value using the formula given in the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates over each digit of the input string in reverse order, correctly applying the positional factor determined by the golden ratio \( q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \), and sums these values to produce the decimal representation. The main part of the program correctly compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the appropriate symbol ('>', '<', or '=') based on the comparison. Given the output hints and the problem description, the program handles all cases as expected without any logical errors or missing edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
