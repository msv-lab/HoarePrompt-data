Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states step by step.

### Initial State
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system.
- `q` is the golden ratio (approximately equal to `1.618033988749895`).
- `decimal` is 0.

### Loop Code
```
for i, c in enumerate(reversed(s)):
    decimal += int(c) * q ** i
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Loop Execution
- The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s`.
- For each character `c` at position `i`, it adds `int(c) * q ** i` to `decimal`.

#### 2. First Iteration
- `i` is the index of the character in the reversed string, starting from the last character (length of `s` - 1).
- `c` is the last character of `s`.
- `decimal` becomes `0 + int(c) * q ** (length_of_s - 1)`.

#### 3. Second Iteration
- `i` is now one less than the previous `i`.
- `c` is the second-to-last character of `s`.
- `decimal` becomes `int(c) * q ** (length_of_s - 2) + int(c) * q ** (length_of_s - 1)`.

#### 4. Third Iteration
- `i` is now two less than the previous `i`.
- `c` is the third-to-last character of `s`.
- `decimal` becomes `int(c) * q ** (length_of_s - 3) + int(c) * q ** (length_of_s - 2) + int(c) * q ** (length_of_s - 1)`.

#### General Case
- After all iterations, `i` will range from `length_of_s - 1` down to `0`.
- `c` will be the character at position `i` in the original string `s`.
- `decimal` will be the sum of `int(c) * q ** i` for all positions `i` from `length_of_s - 1` down to `0`.

### Final Output State
- The loop will execute exactly `length_of_s` times.
- `i` will be the length of `s` minus the current iteration count.
- `c` will be the character at the corresponding position in the original string `s`.
- `decimal` will be the sum of `int(c) * q ** i` for all characters in `s`.

### Conclusion
Since the loop processes all characters in the string `s`, the final state of the loop after all iterations is:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
- `c` is the character at the corresponding position in the original string `s`.
- `i` is the length of `s` minus the current iteration count.
- `decimal` is the sum of `int(c) * q ** i` for all characters in `s`.

### Output State
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `c` is the character at the corresponding position in the original string `s`, `i` is the length of `s` minus the current iteration count, `decimal` is the sum of `int(c) * q ** i` for all characters in `s`.**
