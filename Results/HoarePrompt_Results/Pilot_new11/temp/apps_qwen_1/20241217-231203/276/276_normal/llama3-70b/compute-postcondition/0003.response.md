The code snippet `decimal += int(c) * q ** i` updates the value of `decimal` by adding to it the product of converting `c` (the last character of `s`) to an integer and multiplying it by `q` raised to the power of `i` (where `i` is the index of the last character in `s`). 

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

- `c` is the last character of `s`.
- `i` is the length of `s` minus one.
- `q` is not defined in the initial state, so it remains as a variable `q`.

The value of `decimal` is updated by adding `int(c) * q ** i` to its current value.

Since `s` is a non-empty string, let's denote the length of `s` as `len_s`. Therefore, `i = len_s - 1`. Let's denote the last character of `s` as `last_char`.

So, the updated value of `decimal` will be `decimal + int(last_char) * q ** (len_s - 1)`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the last character of `s`, `i` is the length of `s` minus one, `decimal` is `0 + int(c) * q ** i`**
