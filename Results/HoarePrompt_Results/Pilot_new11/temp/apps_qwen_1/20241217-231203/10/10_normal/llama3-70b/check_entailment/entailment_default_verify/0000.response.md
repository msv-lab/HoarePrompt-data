Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program correctly parses the input, uses the function `func_1` to count the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa, and checks if these counts match the required values. The main loop iterates through each sofa, performs the necessary checks, and prints the correct result. Since the output hints confirm that the function `func_1` correctly counts the relevant sofas based on their coordinates, and the overall logic of the program matches the problem description, the program is indeed correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
