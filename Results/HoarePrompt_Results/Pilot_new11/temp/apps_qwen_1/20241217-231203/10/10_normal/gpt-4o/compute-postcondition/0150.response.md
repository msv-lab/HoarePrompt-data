Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas; `d` is a positive integer; `left_count[i]` is the count of sofas that satisfy `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j` for each `j` in the range `0` to `d-1` for each `i` in the range `0` to `d-1`; `right_count[i]` is the count of sofas that satisfy `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j` for each `j` in the range `0` to `d-1` for each `i` in the range `0` to `d-1`; `top_count[i]` is the count of sofas that satisfy `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j` for each `j` in the range `0` to `d-1` for each `i` in the range `0` to `d-1`; `bottom_count[i]` is the count of sofas that satisfy `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j` for each `j` in the range `0` to `d-1` for each `i` in the range `0` to `d-1`.**
