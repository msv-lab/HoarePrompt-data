The code assigns `i + 1` to `target_sofa`. Given the initial state where `target_sofa` is `i + 2`, after executing this line, `target_sofa` will now be `i + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is in the range `0` to `d-2`, and `target_sofa` is `i + 1`.**
