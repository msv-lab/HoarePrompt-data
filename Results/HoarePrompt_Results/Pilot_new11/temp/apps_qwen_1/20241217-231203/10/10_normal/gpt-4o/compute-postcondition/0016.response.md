`top_count` is assigned the value `[0] * d`. This creates a new list of `d` zeros. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sofas` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas; `d` is a positive integer within its specified range; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are the values from the input split and converted to integers; `left_count` is a list of `d` zeros; `right_count` is a list of `d` zeros; `top_count` is a list of `d` zeros.**
