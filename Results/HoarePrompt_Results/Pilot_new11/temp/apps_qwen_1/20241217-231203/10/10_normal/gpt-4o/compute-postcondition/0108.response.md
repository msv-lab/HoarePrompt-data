To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables and their roles within the loop. Let's break down the relevant parts:

1. **Loop Control Variable**: The loop runs for `j` in the range `0` to `d-1`. Therefore, `j` needs to take values from `0` to `d-1`.

2. **Initial Value of `j`**: Since the loop starts at `j = 0`, the initial value of `j` should be `0`.

3. **Value of `d`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `d` must be greater than `0`. 

4. **Sofas List**: The `sofas` list is used within the loop, but its contents do not directly control the loop's execution. However, we need to ensure that `sofas` is a non-empty list since `j` iterates over the range `0` to `d-1`.

Given these points, let's summarize the required state adjustments:

- `j` must be `0` (the initial value for the loop).
- `d` must be greater than `0` (ensuring the loop can run at least once).
- `sofas` must be a non-empty list (to allow `j` to iterate correctly).

Thus, the state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is:

State: **`j` is `0`, `d` must be greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples**.
