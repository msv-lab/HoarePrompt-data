The code initializes an empty list `sofas`. This does not affect the values of `d`, `n`, `m`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, which remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`d` is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are integers such that 0 ≤ cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b ≤ d - 1; `sofas` is an empty list**
