The code appends a tuple containing the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` to the list `sofas`. Since `sofas` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are input by the user, so they remain unchanged. The value of `d` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`sofas` is [(x1, y1, x2, y2)], `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `d` is a positive integer within its specified range.**
