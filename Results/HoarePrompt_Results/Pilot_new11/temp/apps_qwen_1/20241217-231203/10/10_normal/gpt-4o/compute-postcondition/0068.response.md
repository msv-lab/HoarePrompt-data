The code `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]` assigns the elements of the tuple `sofas[j]` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` respectively. 

- The value of `j` is used to index into the list `sofas`.
- The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are assigned values from `sofas[i]`, and currently, `i` is equal to `j + 1`. After this line, these variables are no longer relevant.
- The values of `d` and `sofas` remain unchanged.

So, the updated values are:
- `x1_j` is assigned the value of `x1` from `sofas[i]`.
- `y1_j` is assigned the value of `y1` from `sofas[i]`.
- `x2_j` is assigned the value of `x2` from `sofas[i]`.
- `y2_j` is assigned the value of `y2` from `sofas[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is 0; `d` is a positive integer; `sofas` is a list of tuples; `x1_j` is equal to `x1` from `sofas[i]`; `y1_j` is equal to `y1` from `sofas[i]`; `x2_j` is equal to `x2` from `sofas[i]`; `y2_j` is equal to `y2` from `sofas[i]`.**
