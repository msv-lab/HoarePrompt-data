The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state of the program. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples**
