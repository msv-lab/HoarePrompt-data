The code increments `right_count[i]` by 1. The value of `right_count[i]` was previously unknown, but now it has been incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j` is equal to `x1` from `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is equal to `y1` from `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is equal to `x2` from `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is equal to `y2` from `sofas[j]`, and `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
