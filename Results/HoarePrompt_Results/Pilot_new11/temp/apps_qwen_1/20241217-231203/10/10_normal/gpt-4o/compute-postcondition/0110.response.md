The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only impact is that the loop continues to the next iteration if it's inside a loop.

Output State: **`j` is `0`, `d` must be greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, and the current value of `i` is equal to `j`.**
