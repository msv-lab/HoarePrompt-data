`top` is incremented by 1. The conditions for updating `left` and `right` do not affect the value of `top`. The initial state of `sofas`, `s`, and the conditions for updating `left` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa; `s` is the next tuple in the list; `left` is increased by 1 if the x-coordinate of the first sofa in `sofas` is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and their y-coordinates are equal, otherwise `left` remains unchanged; `right` is increased by 1; `top` is increased by 1.**
