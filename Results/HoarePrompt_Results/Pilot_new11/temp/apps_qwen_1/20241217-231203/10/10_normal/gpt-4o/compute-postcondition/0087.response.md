The code `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. The other variables remain in their original states. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `left_count[i]`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j` is equal to `x1` from `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` is equal to `y1` from `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` is equal to `x2` from `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` is equal to `y2` from `sofas[j]`, and `left_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
