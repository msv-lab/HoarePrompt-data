Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `i` is 0, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1 if `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`; otherwise, the values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain as they were initially, and the condition `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j` is satisfied**
