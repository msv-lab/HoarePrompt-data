`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `j`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`, `d`, `sofas`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `x1_j` is equal to `x1` from `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is equal to `y1` from `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is equal to `x2` from `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is equal to `y2` from `sofas[2]`, `d` is a positive integer, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and `top_count[i]` is increased by 1 if `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
