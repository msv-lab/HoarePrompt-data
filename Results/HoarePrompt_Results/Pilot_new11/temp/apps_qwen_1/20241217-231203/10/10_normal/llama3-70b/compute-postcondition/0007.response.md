The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `right` is 0, so after executing `right += 1`, the value of `right` becomes 1. The states of the other variables and the list `sofas` are not affected.

Output State: **`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa, and `left` is 1, `right` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. There exists a sofa in `sofas` such that its x-coordinate is less than the x-coordinate of `s` and its y-coordinate is equal to the y-coordinate of `s`. Additionally, the current value of the first sofa in `sofas` has an x-coordinate greater than the x-coordinate of `s` and the same y-coordinate as `s`.**
