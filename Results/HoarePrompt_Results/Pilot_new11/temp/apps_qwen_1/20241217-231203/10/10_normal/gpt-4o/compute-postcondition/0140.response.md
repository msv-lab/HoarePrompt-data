The code assigns the values from the tuple `sofas[j]` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Given that `j` is 2, the tuple `sofas[2]` will be unpacked into these variables. Therefore, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will take on the values of the first, second, third, and fourth elements of `sofas[2]`, respectively.

Since the precondition states that the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged if the if condition `i == j` is true, and here `j` is 2, the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` will be updated with the corresponding elements from `sofas[2]`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`.**
