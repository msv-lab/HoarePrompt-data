The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it relies on several global variables: `d`, `n`, `m`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`. The variable `d` is an integer such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10^5\), and `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\). There are `d` lines each containing four integers \(x_1\), \(y_1\), \(x_2\), \(y_2\) representing the coordinates of the i-th sofa, where \(1 \leq x_1, x_2 \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y_1, y_2 \leq m\) and \((x_1, y_1) \neq (x_2, y_2)\). Additionally, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` are integers such that \(0 \leq cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b \leq d - 1\).

The function does not return any value directly from its body, but rather processes the input data and updates the global variables.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes global variables including `d`, `n`, `m`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b`, and updates them based on the coordinates of sofas provided in `d` lines.**
