Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa, `left` and `right` values are either 1 or unchanged, `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 0. The first sofa in `sofas` has the same y-coordinate as `s`. If the x-coordinate of the first sofa in `sofas` is greater than the x-coordinate of `s`, then `left` and `right` remain 1. Otherwise, no change is made to `left` and `right` values.***
