Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[0]`, if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, then `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and `right_count[i]` and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `bottom_count[i]`, `right_count[i]`, and `left_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
