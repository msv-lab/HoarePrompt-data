Postcondition: ***`sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, each tuple containing four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of sofas, `d` is a positive integer, `i` is in the range `0` to `d-2`, and `target_sofa` is `i + 1`. If the condition `left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b)` is true, the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside will be broken. If the condition is false, the program continues executing the next statement outside the if-else block.***
