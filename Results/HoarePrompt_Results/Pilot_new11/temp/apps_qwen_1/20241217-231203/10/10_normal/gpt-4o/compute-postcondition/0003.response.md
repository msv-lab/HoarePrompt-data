To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the structure of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- `d` is an integer such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10^5\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are integers such that \(0 \leq cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b \leq d - 1\).
- `sofas` is an empty list.

### For Loop:
```
for _ in range(d):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Variable (`_`):**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `d-1`.
   - Therefore, the loop variable `_` must take each value from `0` to `d-1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will run as long as the loop variable `_` is less than `d`.

3. **Initial Values:**
   - Since `d` is an integer between \(1\) and \(10^5\), the loop will definitely run at least once if `d` is greater than `0`.
   - Given that `d` is specified to be in the range \(1 \leq d \leq 10^5\), we can assume `d` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `d` is a positive integer within its specified range.
   - There is no direct dependency on `n` or `m` for this particular loop.
   - The initial values of `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` do not affect the loop execution directly.

Given these points, the critical state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `d` is a positive integer within its specified range.

### Final Answer:
State: **`d` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10^5\)**.
