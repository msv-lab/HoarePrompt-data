Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from `sofas[1]`. `top_count[i]` remains unchanged, `bottom_count[i]` remains unchanged, `right_count[i]` remains unchanged, and `left_count[i]` remains unchanged since the condition `i == j` is true and no changes are made within the if block.***
