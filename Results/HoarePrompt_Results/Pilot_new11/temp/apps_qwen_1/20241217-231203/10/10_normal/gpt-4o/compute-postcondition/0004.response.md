The code `x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().strip().split())` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. These variables are now holding the values input by the user, and the initial state regarding `d` being a positive integer within its specified range remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are the integers input by the user; `d` is a positive integer within its specified range.**
