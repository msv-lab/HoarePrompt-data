d is an integer such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, there are d lines each containing four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 representing the coordinates of the i-th sofa where 1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n and 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m, and the cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have a common side, (x_1, y_1) ≠ (x_2, y_2), and no cell is covered by more than one sofa. Additionally, there are four integers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} such that 0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1.
