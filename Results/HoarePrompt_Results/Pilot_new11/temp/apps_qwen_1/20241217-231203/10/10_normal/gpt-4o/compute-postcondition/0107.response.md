The code snippet unpacks the tuple `sofas[i]` into the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. This means that the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are now the values from the `i`-th tuple in the `sofas` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `d`, `d` is `d + 1`, `sofas` is a list of tuples, `top_count[i]` is the count of sofas that satisfy `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j` for each `j` in the range `0` to `d-1`, `left_count[i]` is the count of sofas that satisfy `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j` for each `j` in the range `0` to `d-1`, `right_count[i]` is the count of sofas that satisfy `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j` for each `j` in the range `0` to `d-1`, `bottom_count[i]` is the count of sofas that satisfy `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j` for each `j` in the range `0` to `d-1`, `x1` is the original value from `sofas[i]`, `y1` is the original value from `sofas[i]`, `x2` is the original value from `sofas[i]`, `y2` is the original value from `sofas[i]`, `x1` is the original value from `sofas[i]`, `y1` is the original value from `sofas[i]`, `x2` is the original value from `sofas[i]`, `y2` is the original value from `sofas[i]`.**
