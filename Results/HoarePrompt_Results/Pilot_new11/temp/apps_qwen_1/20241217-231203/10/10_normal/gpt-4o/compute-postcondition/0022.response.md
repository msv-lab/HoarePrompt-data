The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the value of `j` remains unchanged, `d` remains greater than 0, and the list `sofas` is not modified. The value of `i` is equal to `j`, and since `continue` does not change any variables, `i` also remains 0.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a list of tuples that must contain at least `d` tuples, `i` is equal to `j`.**
