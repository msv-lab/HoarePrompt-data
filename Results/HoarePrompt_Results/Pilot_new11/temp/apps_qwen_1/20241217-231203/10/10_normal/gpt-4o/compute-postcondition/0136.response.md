Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `d` is greater than 0, `sofas` is a non-empty list of tuples, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`. If `y1 > y2_j` and `y2 > y2_j`, then `top_count[i]` is increased by 1 and the states of `left_count[i]` and `bottom_count[i]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the states of `left_count[i]`, `bottom_count[i]`, and `top_count[i]` remain unchanged.***
