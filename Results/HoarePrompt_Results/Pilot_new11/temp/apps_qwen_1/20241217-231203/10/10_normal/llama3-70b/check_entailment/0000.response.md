Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the sofa that matches the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input, storing the coordinates of each sofa and extracting the count values (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`).

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. It iterates over all sofas and checks the position relative to the current sofa to update the counts.

3. **Main Logic**: The main loop iterates over each sofa, calls `func_1` to get the counts, and checks if these counts match the required values (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`). If a match is found, the program prints the index of the sofa and breaks out of the loop. If no match is found after checking all sofas, it prints `-1`.

Given the logic and the structure of the code, it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The code accurately implements the requirements without missing any conditions or edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
