The code initializes four variables `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` to 0. It does not affect the values of the existing variables `sofa`, `sofas`, `d`, `n`, or `m`. 

Output State: **`sofa` is a tuple containing the coordinates of a sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), `sofas` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the coordinates of a sofa, `d`, `n`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; left is 0, right is 0, top is 0, bottom is 0.**
