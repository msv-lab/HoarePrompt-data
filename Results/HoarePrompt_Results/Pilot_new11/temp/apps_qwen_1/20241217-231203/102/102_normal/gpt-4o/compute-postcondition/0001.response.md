The code assigns the value of the input to variable `a`. Since `n` was previously an integer input, and now the user is prompted to enter another integer which is assigned to `a`, the value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still an integer input, and `a` now holds the new integer input value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer**
