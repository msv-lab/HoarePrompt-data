The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since the values of `x` and `y` are not altered by this line of code, they remain the same as their initial values from the initial state. The conditions `x * a + y * b == n` and `n` being a non-negative input integer are also preserved.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `n` is a non-negative input integer, `x` is unchanged, `y` is the value of `(n - x * a) // b`, and the condition `x * a + y * b == n` is satisfied; `x` and `y` are printed.**
