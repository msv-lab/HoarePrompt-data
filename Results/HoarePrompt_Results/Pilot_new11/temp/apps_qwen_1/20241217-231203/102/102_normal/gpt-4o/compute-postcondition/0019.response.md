The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. According to the initial state, `y` is defined as `(n - x * a) // b`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the condition `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b != 0` also remains unchanged. However, the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, so we can only say that `y` is calculated as `(n - x * a) // b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, `a` and `b` are integers, the condition `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b != 0` remains unchanged, `y` is `(n - x * a) // b`, and `x` and `y` are printed.**
