Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is `x_current + 1`, `y` is `(n - (x_current + 1) * a) // b`, and if `x * a + y * b == n`, the condition is satisfied without printing 'YES' x, y. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables' values and the condition remains unverified.***
