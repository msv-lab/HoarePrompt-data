You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.

-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program uses a nested loop approach where it iterates over possible values of `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) up to `n // a`. However, this approach may miss solutions where `y` (number of Bars bars) is zero, which means no Bars bars are bought. This can lead to missing valid solutions.

For example, consider the input:
```
15
4
8
```

The program will iterate through possible values of `x`:
- For `x = 0`, `y = (15 - 0 * 4) // 8 = 1`, which satisfies the equation `0 * 4 + 1 * 8 = 8`, but not `15`.
- For `x = 1`, `y = (15 - 1 * 4) // 8 = 1`, which satisfies the equation `1 * 4 + 1 * 8 = 12`, but not `15`.
- ...
- For `x = 3`, `y = (15 - 3 * 4) // 8 = 0`, which satisfies the equation `3 * 4 + 0 * 8 = 12`, but not `15`.

Since the program does not check for the case where `y` could be zero, it will not find the solution `x = 3` and `y = 0`, leading to the incorrect output "NO".

To fix this, the program should include a check for `y = 0` after the loop, ensuring all possible combinations are considered.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10 000 000, and n, a, and b are provided as inputs to the function.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is `n // a`, `y` is `(n - (n // a) * a) // b`. If `x * a + y * b == n` is satisfied, then 'YES' is printed to the console and the values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, no such pair of `x` and `y` is found.
    print('NO')


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
