The code `print('YES')` does not change any variable values; it only prints a string to the console. The conditions and values of the variables before the print statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the input integer, `b` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `n` is a non-negative input integer, `x` is unchanged, `y` is the value of `(n - x * a) // b`, and the condition `x * a + y * b == n` is satisfied**
