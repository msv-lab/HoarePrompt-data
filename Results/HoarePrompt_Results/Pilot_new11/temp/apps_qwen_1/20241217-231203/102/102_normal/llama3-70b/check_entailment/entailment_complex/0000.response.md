Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads three integer inputs: `n`, `a`, and `b` within the specified ranges (1 to 10,000,000).

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - The program uses a brute-force approach to check all possible combinations of `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` from 0 to `n // a` (inclusive).
   - For each value of `x`, it calculates the corresponding value of `y` using the equation `y = (n - x * a) // b`.
   - It checks if the current `x` and `y` satisfy the equation `x * a + y * b == n`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and exits.
   - If no valid pair is found after the loop completes, the program prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no solution is found (e.g., when `n` cannot be expressed as a linear combination of `a` and `b`).
   - It also correctly handles the case where `n` is less than both `a` and `b` by checking the bounds in the for loop (`x in range(n // a + 1)`).

5. **Compliance with Problem Description**:
   - The program accurately determines whether it is possible to buy some number of Ber-Cola and Bars bars such that the total cost equals `n`.
   - It outputs the correct response ("YES" or "NO") and the appropriate values of `x` and `y` if a solution exists.

Given that the program adheres to the problem description and correctly handles all scenarios without violating any constraints, the program is correct.
