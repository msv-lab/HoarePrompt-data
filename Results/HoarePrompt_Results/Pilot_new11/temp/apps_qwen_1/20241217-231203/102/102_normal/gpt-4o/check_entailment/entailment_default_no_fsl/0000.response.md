Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code only checks for solutions where \( x \cdot a \leq n \) and \( (n - x \cdot a) \) is divisible by \( b \). However, it does not account for cases where \( x \cdot a > n \), which could still result in \( y \cdot b \) being part of the solution.

For example, consider the following input:
```
10
3
2
```

According to the problem description, a valid solution would be \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 2 \) because \( 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 2 = 10 \). However, the current code will not find this solution because it only checks up to \( x = \frac{n}{a} \).

To fix this, the code should iterate over possible values of \( y \) and check if \( n - y \cdot b \) is divisible by \( a \). Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    found = False
    for y in range(n // b + 1):
        if (n - y * b) % a == 0:
            x = (n - y * b) // a
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            found = True
            break
    if not found:
        print('NO')
```

This version iterates over possible values of \( y \) and checks if \( n - y \cdot b \) is divisible by \( a \), ensuring that all possible solutions are checked.
