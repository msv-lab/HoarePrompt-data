`y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. Given the initial condition that `(n - x * a) % b` evaluates to 0, it means that `(n - x * a)` is exactly divisible by `b`. Therefore, `(n - x * a) // b` will be an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `y` is an integer equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, and `(n - x * a) % b` evaluates to 0**
