The code `print('YES')` does not change any variable values but simply prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, and `(n - x * a) % b` evaluates to 0; printed text is 'YES'**
