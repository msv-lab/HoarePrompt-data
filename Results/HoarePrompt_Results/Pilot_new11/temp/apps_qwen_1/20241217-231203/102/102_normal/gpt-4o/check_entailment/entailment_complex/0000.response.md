Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if there exist non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\). The program iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 0 to \(n // a\).

2. **Loop Logic**: For each value of \(x\), the program checks if \((n - x \cdot a) \% b == 0\). If this condition is true, it means that \(y = (n - x \cdot a) // b\) is an integer, and thus, the equation \(x \cdot a + y \cdot b = n\) holds. In such a case, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

3. **No Match Found**: If no such pair \((x, y)\) is found within the loop, the program prints "NO".

4. **Range Consideration**: The loop runs from \(x = 0\) to \(x = n // a\), ensuring that all possible values of \(x\) are checked without exceeding the range necessary for the problem constraints.

5. **Output Format**: The program adheres to the specified output format, printing "YES" or "NO" and the corresponding values of \(x\) and \(y\) if applicable.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all possible cases within the given constraints, it is deemed correct.
