Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` and `b` are integers. The condition `(n - x * a) % b == 0` holds true if it is true, otherwise `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b != 0` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `x` from `0` to `n // a`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**: Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `x` was some value `x_prev`, and the condition `(n - x_prev * a) % b == 0` held true.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `x` will be `x_prev + 1`.

5. **Condition Check**: We need to check if the condition `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b == 0` holds true for the next iteration. If it does, then the loop will continue. However, since we don't know if this condition will hold true, we assume it might not, hence the condition remains as `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b != 0` unchanged.

6. **State Adjustment**: Since `x` is incremented by 1, the new value of `x` will be `x_prev + 1`. The other conditions (`n >= a` and `a` and `b` being integers) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` and `b` are integers. The condition remains as `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b != 0` unchanged.**

However, to provide a concrete state format, we need to specify the values clearly. Assuming `x_prev` was the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration, the state would be:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to `a`, and `a` and `b` are integers. The condition remains as `(n - (x_prev + 1) * a) % b != 0` unchanged.**
