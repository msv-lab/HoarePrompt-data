The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. From the initial state, we know:
- `x` is `x + 1`
- `y` is `(n - (x + 1) * a) // b`

After the code `print(x, y)` executes, the values of `x` and `y` are printed, but their actual values are not specified in the initial state. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and the input integers for `a` and `b` are also not specified in a way that would allow us to compute specific values for `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the output state will include the print statement itself and the unchanged variables from the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is `x + 1`, `y` is `(n - (x + 1) * a) // b`, 'YES' is printed to the console, the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
