Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts three integer inputs `n`, `a`, and `b` (all between 1 and 10,000,000). It attempts to find non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that `x * a + y * b = n`. If such a pair is found, the function prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and then exits. If no such pair exists, the function prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only outputs to the console. Potential edge cases include when `n` is less than `a` or `b`, or when `n` cannot be expressed as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.**

**Summary of Actions and Final State:**
- The function first reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the standard input.
- It then iterates over possible values of `x` from `0` to `n // a`.
- For each `x`, it calculates `y` as `(n - x * a) // b`.
- If `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, the function prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y` and exits.
- If no such `x` and `y` are found after the loop completes, the function prints "NO".
- The function does not modify `a` or `b` except during the calculation of `y`.
- The function's final state is that it has either printed "YES" and the values of `x` and `y`, or "NO" if no solution was found.
