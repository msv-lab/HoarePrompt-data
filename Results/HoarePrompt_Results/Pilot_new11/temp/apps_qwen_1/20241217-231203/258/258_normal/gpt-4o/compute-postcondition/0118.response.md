The code assigns the values of `meats[i]` to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cx`, `cy`, `count`, and `i + 1` remain unchanged from the initial state. Since `meats[i]` provides the specific values for `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`, these new values replace the previous ones.

Output State: **`dx` retains its value, `dy` retains its value, `d2` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, `my` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` retains its value, `y2` retains its value, `c2` retains its value, `x1` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `d` retains its value, `cx` retains its value, `cy` retains its value, `count` retains its value.**
