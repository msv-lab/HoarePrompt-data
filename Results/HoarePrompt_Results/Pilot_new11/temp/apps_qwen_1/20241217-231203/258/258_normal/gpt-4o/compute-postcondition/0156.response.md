Postcondition: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx` remain unchanged, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(dx^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), and the current value of `d * d2` is greater than `d2`**
