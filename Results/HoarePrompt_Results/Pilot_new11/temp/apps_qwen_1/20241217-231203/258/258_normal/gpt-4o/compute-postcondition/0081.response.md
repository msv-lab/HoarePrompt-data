The value of `d` is divided by `c1 * c2`. Since `d` is initially less than 0 and `c1` and `c2` are non-zero (otherwise division would be undefined), the new value of `d` will still be less than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `N`, `i`, `meats`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged; `d` is less than 0 and equal to `d / (c1 * c2)`**
