The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not indicate which loop this statement is part of. Since the variables `d2`, `d`, `N`, `meats`, `i`, `cx`, `y1`, `y2`, `dy`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `cy`, and `dx` are not within any loop context provided, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the `continue` statement does not affect any of these variables, and the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`d2` is `dx * dx + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `d2`, `d`, `N`, `meats`, `i`, `cx`, `y1`, `y2`, `dy`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `d`, `cy`, `dx` remain the same**
