`cy` is assigned the value `(y1 + y2) / 2`. Given that `y1` and `y2` retain their original values, `cy` now holds the average of these two values. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dx` retains its value, `dy` retains its value, `d2` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, `my` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is equal to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is equal to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `count` retains its value.**
