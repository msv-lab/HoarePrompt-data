Postcondition: ***`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - sqrt(d)`, the count is determined by the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x1) ** 2 + (my - y1) ** 2)`, and the current value of `count` is greater than or equal to `K`***
