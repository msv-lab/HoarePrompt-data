Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks integer coordinates for the heat source. However, the problem description specifies that the coordinates \(X\) and \(Y\) are real numbers, not just integers. Therefore, the program might miss the optimal solution where the heat source is placed at a non-integer coordinate, leading to a suboptimal result.

To fix this, the program needs to consider real-number coordinates for the heat source, not just integer coordinates. One approach could be using a grid of finer resolution to approximate the optimal solution, or employing a more sophisticated optimization method such as gradient descent or a numerical optimization library.
