The function `func_3()` iterates over all possible integer values of `x` and `y` within the range \([-1000, 1000]\). For each combination of `x` and `y`, it calls the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` which presumably generates a list of times. These times are then sorted, and the K-th smallest element from each sorted list is considered. The function keeps track of the minimum value among these K-th smallest elements across all combinations of `x` and `y`. After completing all iterations, it returns this minimum value. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input ranges for `x` and `y` might cause integer overflow or where the input constraints for `K` and `N` might not be fully validated within the provided code. However, since the provided code only focuses on the iteration and calculation of the K-th smallest element, the function does not explicitly handle these edge cases.
