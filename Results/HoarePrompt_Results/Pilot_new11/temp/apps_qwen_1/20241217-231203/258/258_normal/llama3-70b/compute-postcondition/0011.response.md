The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Given the initial state, `x` and `y` are integers (`x` in the range \([-1000, 1000]\) and `y` is specifically 1000). However, the function `func_2` is not defined, so we cannot determine what `times` will be set to without knowing its implementation.

Since `func_2` is not specified, let's assume a generic behavior where `func_2` returns a list of two integers. Let's denote these integers as `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are the results of the function. Thus, `times = [a, b]`.

The initial state gives us:
- `x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\)
- `y` is 1000
- `times` is a sorted list of two integers in the range \([-1000, 1000]\)
- `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[1]` (which is `times[1]` after the assignment)

After the line `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`, `times` will be a list of two integers `[a, b]`. Since `func_2` returns a list of two integers, and no further details about the function's behavior are provided, we can only state that `times` will be a sorted list of two integers.

Let's denote the returned values from `func_2` as `a` and `b` such that `times = [a, b]` where `a <= b`.

The value of `ans` will be updated to the minimum between its current value and `times[1]`, which is `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\)
- `y` is 1000
- `times` is a sorted list of two integers `[a, b]`
- `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `b`

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\), `y` is 1000, `times` is a sorted list of two integers `[a, b]`, `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `b`**
