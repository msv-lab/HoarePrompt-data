The code swaps the values of `x1, y1, c1` with `x2, y2, c2`. Let's list the impacts and calculate the result step by step:

- Initially, `x1` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, and `c1` is equal to `meats[i][2]`.
- Similarly, `x2` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, and `c2` is equal to `meats[j][2]`.

After the code execution:
- `x1` will take the value of `x2`, which is `meats[j][0]`.
- `y1` will take the value of `y2`, which is `meats[j][1]`.
- `c1` will take the value of `c2`, which is `meats[j][2]`.
- `x2` will take the value of `x1`, which is `meats[i][0]`.
- `y2` will take the value of `y1`, which is `meats[i][1]`.
- `c2` will take the value of `c1`, which is `meats[i][2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`dx` retains its value, `dy` retains its value, `d2` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, `my` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]`, `d` retains its value, `cx` retains its value, `cy` retains its value, `count` retains its value.**
