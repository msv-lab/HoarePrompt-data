The value of `index` is incremented by 3, changing it from its initial value of 8 to 11. The other variables (`data`, `N`, `meats`, `x`, `y`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is a positive integer, `meats` is a list containing two tuples `[(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10])), (int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))]`, `index` is 11, `x` is the integer value of `data[8]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
