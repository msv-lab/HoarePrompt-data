Postcondition: **`dx` retains its value, `dy` retains its value, `d2` retains its value, `mx` retains its value, `my` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]`, `d` retains its value, `cx` retains its value, `cy` retains its value, `count` retains its value.**

Explanation: Since there is no else part in the given code, the postcondition directly follows from the if part. The if condition ensures that the values of `x1, y1, c1` are swapped with `x2, y2, c2`, while all other variables retain their original values.
