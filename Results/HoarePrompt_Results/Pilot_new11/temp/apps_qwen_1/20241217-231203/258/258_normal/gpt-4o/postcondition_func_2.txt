The function `func_3` accepts no parameters directly but reads `N`, `K`, and a list of tuples `meats` from standard input. Each tuple in `meats` represents the coordinates and hardness of a piece of meat in the form `(x, y, c)`, where `x` and `y` are integers in the range [-1000, 1000], and `c` is an integer in the range [1, 100]. After processing the input, it calls `func_2(N, K, meats)` to compute a specific value based on the input data. Finally, it prints the computed value formatted to six decimal places. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs for `N`, `K`, `x`, `y`, or `c` values outside the specified ranges, although the code does not explicitly handle these cases. The function does not perform any operations beyond reading input and calling `func_2`, and it assumes that `func_2` correctly processes the input and returns a valid result. If `func_2` is not implemented, the function will fail to produce the expected output.
