`cy` is assigned the value of `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The value of `y2` is not given, but it does not affect the preconditions of the other variables. The output state includes the updated value for `cy` and maintains the unchanged values for the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, and `y1` remain unchanged, and `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.**
