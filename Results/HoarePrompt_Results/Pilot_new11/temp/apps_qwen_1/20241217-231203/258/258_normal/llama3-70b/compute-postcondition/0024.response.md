Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x`: `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`.
   - `y`: `-998`.
   - `ans`: Updated to be the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for y in range(-1000, 1001):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` from `-1000` to `1000` inclusive.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `y` is the current value of `y` at the start of the previous iteration.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `y` from `-1000` to `1000`, the only state that needs to change is `y`.
   - At the start of the previous iteration, `y` was `-998`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be `-997`.

6. **Adjusted States:**
   - `x` remains unchanged as it was `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`.
   - `y` changes to `-997`.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it was updated based on the condition but not modified during the loop.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`; `y` is `-997`; `ans` is the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`**
