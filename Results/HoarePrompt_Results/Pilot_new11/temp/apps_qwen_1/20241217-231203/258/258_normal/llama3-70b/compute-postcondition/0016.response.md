Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`.
- `y` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
- `ans` is the minimum value of the K-th smallest element from all times lists generated during the loop iterations.

### For Loop:
```
for y in range(-1000, 1001):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `y`:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` values from `-1000` to `1000` (inclusive). Therefore, we don't need to adjust the initial state of `y` because it is already within the required range. However, we need to ensure that each iteration of the loop sets `y` to one of these values.
   
2. **Variable `x`:**
   - `x` is initially determined based on the condition `x_current < 1000`. If `x_current < 1000`, then `x = x_current + 1`. Otherwise, `x = -1000`. This means that `x` should be set to either `x_current + 1` or `-1000` depending on the initial value of `x_current`.

3. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is initialized as the minimum value of the K-th smallest element from all times lists generated during the loop iterations. Since the loop hasn't started yet, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will be updated based on the results of the loop iterations. We only need to ensure that `ans` is correctly updated after each iteration.

### Adjusted States:
- We need to ensure that `x` is correctly set to either `x_current + 1` or `-1000` based on the initial value of `x_current`.
- We need to ensure that `y` iterates through the range \([-1000, 1000]\).

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is `-1000`, `y` must iterate through the range \([-1000, 1000]\), and `ans` is the minimum value of the K-th smallest element from all times lists generated during the loop iterations.**

This ensures that the loop can execute correctly with the appropriate initial conditions for `x` and `y`, and that `ans` will be updated appropriately during the loop iterations.
