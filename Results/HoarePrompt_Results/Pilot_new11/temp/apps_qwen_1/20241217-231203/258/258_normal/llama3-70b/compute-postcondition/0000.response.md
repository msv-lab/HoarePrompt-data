The line of code `ans = float('inf')` assigns the value of positive infinity to the variable `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, `c_i`, `x_i`, or `y_i`. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000], `y` is an integer in the range [-1000, 1000]; K and N are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 60, 1 ≤ K ≤ N; `c_i` are integers in the range [1, 100]; `x_i` and `y_i` are integers in the range [-1000, 1000]; each (x_i, y_i) is unique; `ans` is positive infinity.**
