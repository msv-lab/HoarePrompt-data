The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `N` and `K` are integers, and the list `meats` is unchanged. The variables `x_i`, `y_i`, and `c_i` remain unaffected as they are not mentioned in the given code. 

Since the input is split into a list, the type of `data` changes from a string to a list of strings. The values of `N` and `K` are no longer directly accessible as integers in this context but are part of the initial conditions.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 <= K <= N, and -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 for all i. c_i is an integer such that 1 <= c_i <= 100 for all i. The list `meats` contains tuples (x, y, c) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, where the length of `meats` is equal to N.**
