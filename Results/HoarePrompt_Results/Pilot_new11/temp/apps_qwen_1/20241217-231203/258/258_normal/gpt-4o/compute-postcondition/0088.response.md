The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one. However, in this case, there is no loop context provided, so the `continue` statement does not affect the variables `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, or `d * d2 > d2`. The values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)`, and `d * d2 > d2`**
