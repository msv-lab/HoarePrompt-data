The code `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy` updates the value of `d2` by calculating the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. Given the initial values, we can substitute them into the equation.

From the initial state:
- `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `dy` is \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\)

So, `d2` becomes:
\[ d2 = \left( \frac{x1 - x2}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]}{2} \right)^2 \]

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `dx` remains \((x1 - x2) / 2\)
- `dy` remains \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\)
- `d` remains \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\)
- `cx` remains \((x1 + x2) / 2\)
- `cy` remains \((y1 + y2) / 2\)
- `count` remains unchanged

Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left( \frac{x1 - x2}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{meats[j][1] - meats[i][1]}{2} \right)^2\), `d` retains its value, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `count` retains its value, `j` is `i + 1`, `x2` is equal to `meats[i][0]`, `y2` is equal to `meats[i][1]`, `c2` is equal to `meats[i][2]`, `x1` is equal to `meats[j][0]`, `y1` is equal to `meats[j][1]`, `c1` is equal to `meats[j][2]`**
