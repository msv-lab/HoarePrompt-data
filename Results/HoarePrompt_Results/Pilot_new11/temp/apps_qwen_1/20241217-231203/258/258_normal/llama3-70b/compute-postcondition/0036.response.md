`times` is the result of `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`. After the function call, `times` is a list containing two elements, which are the results of the function call. The `sort()` method sorts the list in ascending order, but the exact values of the elements in `times` are not specified. Since `y` is within the range -1000 to 1000 and is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `x` is -999, the values of `x` and `y` do not change. The variable `ans` remains -999.

After the `sort()` method is called, the list `times` will be sorted, but the specific values of the elements in `times` cannot be determined without knowing the exact values returned by `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is within the range -1000 to 1000 and is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `times` is a sorted list of two elements resulting from `func_2(-999, y, -999, y)`, `ans` is -999**
