Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end - 1`, `j` is `i_end`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` remains false, `x1` is `meats[i_end - 1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[i_end - 1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[i_end - 1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[j][0]`, `y2` is `meats[j][1]`, `c2` is `meats[j][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my` are unchanged, `count` is the number of elements `(x, y, c)` in the `meats` list satisfying the condition, and `count` is less than `K`. If `d < 0`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, nothing changes.***
