`N` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`, which means `N` is converted from the first element of the list `data` to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000 for all i. `meats` is a list of tuples (x, y, c) representing the coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat, where the length of `meats` is equal to N.**
