The function `func_3` accepts no explicit parameters. The functionality involves iterating over a range of values for `y` and generating lists of integers sorted in ascending order for each iteration. It then finds the K-th smallest element from each generated list and returns the minimum value among these K-th smallest elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the minimum value of the K-th smallest element from all the times lists generated during the loop iterations, where each times list is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and y has iterated through the range \([-1000, 1000]\).**
