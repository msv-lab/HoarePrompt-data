Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_3` uses a brute-force approach to iterate over all possible integer values of \(x\) and \(y\) within the range \([-1000, 1000]\). This approach is problematic because it may not cover all potential cases due to the discrete nature of the search space. Specifically:

1. **Range Limitation**: The range \([-1000, 1000]\) for both \(x\) and \(y\) might miss optimal solutions if the true optimal point lies outside this range. The problem description allows for real numbers, so the solution could theoretically lie anywhere in the 2D plane.

2. **Precision Issue**: Using only integer coordinates may lead to suboptimal results if the true optimal point is between two integer coordinates. The code does not handle real-valued coordinates directly, leading to potential precision loss.

3. **Brute-Force Inefficiency**: Given the constraints \(1 \leq N \leq 60\), the brute-force approach will evaluate \(2001 \times 2001 = 4,004,001\) combinations, which is computationally expensive and may not be efficient enough.

To ensure correctness, the code should ideally use a more sophisticated optimization technique, such as gradient descent or a numerical optimization method, to find the optimal coordinates for the heat source. This would allow the program to handle real-numbered coordinates and potentially cover the entire 2D plane efficiently.
