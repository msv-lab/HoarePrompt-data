`d` is divided by the product of `c1` and `c2`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `c1`, `c2`, and `d`, the updated value of `d` will be `d / (c1 * c2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d2`, `d`, `N`, `meats`, `i`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `mx`, `my`, `count`, `d` remain unchanged, `d` is updated to `d / (c1 * c2)`**
