Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully address the problem description. Specifically, the code uses binary search (`func_2`) to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. However, the binary search range starts from `0` to `1000000000.0`, which is unnecessarily large and might not cover the actual range of possible times required. Given the constraints, the maximum possible time is much smaller.

To illustrate this issue, consider a case where all meat pieces have the same coordinates and hardness. In such a scenario, the time required to grill any piece of meat is constant and does not depend on the position of the heat source. The correct range for the binary search should be from `0` to the maximum hardness of the meat pieces multiplied by the distance between the farthest points in the plane, but the current implementation does not adjust the range appropriately.

Hereâ€™s an example to demonstrate the issue:

### Sample Input
```
4 3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```

### Expected Output
```
0.0
```

### Actual Output
```
2.4
```

This discrepancy indicates that the binary search range is too large, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
