You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided information and the loop code:

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over `y` from \(-1000\) to \(1000\). For each value of `y`, the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` generates a list `times`. This list is then sorted, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the \(K\)-th smallest element in the sorted list `times`.

### Initial Values
- `x` is set to `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is \(-1000\).
- `y` is an integer in the range \([-1000, 1000]\).
- `ans` is initialized as the minimum value of the \(K\)-th smallest element from all times lists generated during the loop iterations.

### Observations from Provided Output States
- After the loop executes 1 time, `x` remains the same as the initial value, `y` starts iterating from \(-1000\), and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the \(K\)-th smallest element from the first iteration of `times`.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `y` increases to \(-999\), and `ans` is updated again based on the \(K\)-th smallest element from the second iteration of `times`.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `y` increases to \(-998\), and `ans` is updated based on the \(K\)-th smallest element from the third iteration of `times`.

### Conclusion
After all iterations of the loop, `y` will have iterated through the entire range \([-1000, 1000]\). Therefore, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value among all the \(K\)-th smallest elements from each iteration of the list `times`.

### Output State
- `x` remains unchanged after the loop completes, and its value is determined by the initial condition: `x` is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `x` is \(-1000\).
- `y` will have iterated through the full range \([-1000, 1000]\), so it is no longer a variable but a sequence of values.
- `ans` will be the minimum value of the \(K\)-th smallest element from all the `times` lists generated during the loop iterations.

**Output State:**
```
x is `x_current + 1` if `x_current < 1000`, otherwise `-1000`; y has iterated through the range \([-1000, 1000]\); `ans` is the minimum value of the \(K\)-th smallest element from all the `times` lists generated during the loop iterations; `times` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
```
```
for x in range(-1000, 1001):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
