Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, and `c1` remain unchanged. `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` take the values of the original `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` respectively. `N`, `i`, `meats`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` becomes `x2`, `y1` becomes `y2`, and `c1` becomes `c2`. Otherwise, the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` remain the same as they were initially.***
