According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the condition `N > i_end`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `i_end - 1`
- `N` is greater than `i_end`
- The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` remain unchanged
- `count` is the number of elements `(x, y, c)` in the `meats` list satisfying the condition, and `count` is less than `K`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range defined by `i + 1` to `N` and `j` should be incremented from `i_end` to `i_end + 1`.

So, `j` will be set to `i_end` (the current `i + 1`), and the condition `N > i_end` remains true.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` remains the same (`i_end - 1`)
- `j` is set to `i_end`
- `N` remains the same (greater than `i_end`)
- The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` remains false
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` remain unchanged
- `count` remains the same (less than `K`)

State: **`i` is `i_end - 1`, `j` is `i_end`, `N` is greater than `i_end`, the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` is false, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `d`, `x2`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my = cy - dx * \frac{\sqrt{d2 * d - d^2}}{d2}`, `count` is the number of elements `(x, y, c)` in the `meats` list satisfying the condition, and `count` is less than `K`**
