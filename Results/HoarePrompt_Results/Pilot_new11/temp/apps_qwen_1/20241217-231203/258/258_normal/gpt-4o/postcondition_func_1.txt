The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` and `K` are integers such that \(1 \le K \le N \le 60\), and `meats` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \((x_i, y_i, c_i)\) representing the coordinates and hardness of the \(i\)-th piece of meat respectively, with \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\) and \(1 \le c_i \le 100\).

After executing the function body, it returns `high`, which is the largest possible value such that `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to `False` and the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, and return the largest value `high` such that `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to `False` and the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`.
