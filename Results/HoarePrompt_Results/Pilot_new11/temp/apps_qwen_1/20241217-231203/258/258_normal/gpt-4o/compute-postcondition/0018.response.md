The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `x`. Given that `index` is 12, `x` will be assigned the value of `data[12]`, which is an integer since `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input.

The states of other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input, `N` must be greater than 1, `meats` is a list containing two tuples `[(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10])), (int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))]`, `index` is 12, `x` is the integer value of `data[12]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[9]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[10]`**
