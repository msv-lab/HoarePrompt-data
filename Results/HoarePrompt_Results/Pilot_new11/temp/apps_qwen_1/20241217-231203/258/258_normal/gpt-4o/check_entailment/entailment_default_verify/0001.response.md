Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The `func_1` function is intended to find a midpoint between pairs of meat pieces and check if the distance from these midpoints would allow K or more pieces to be ready within time T. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal position globally but rather locally compares pairs. 

The correct approach involves using a binary search (`func_2`) to find the minimum time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready. However, the `func_1` function is not designed to serve this purpose correctly. Additionally, even if `func_2` were to be implemented correctly, `func_1` still needs to be fixed to ensure it properly identifies the optimal position for the heat source.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
