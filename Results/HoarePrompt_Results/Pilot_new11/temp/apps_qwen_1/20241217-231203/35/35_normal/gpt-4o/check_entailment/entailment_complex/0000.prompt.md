You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Annotated Functions:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, and both are the smallest value for which `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`. `mid` is equal to `low` and `high`.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1 where low is equal to high and both are the smallest values for which can_distribute(mid) returns True, and mid is equal to low and high
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). It performs a binary search to find the smallest value `x` for which the function `can_distribute(x)` returns `True`. After the loop, `low` equals `high` and both represent the smallest value for which `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`. The function returns `low - 1`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns `low - 1`, where `low` and `high` are equal and represent the smallest value for which `can_distribute(mid)` returns `True`. If no such value exists, `low - 1` will be 0.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n`, `a`, and `b` are such that `can_distribute(mid)` never returns `True`, the function will still execute the loop but will eventually set `low` to `min(a, b) + 1`. In this case, `low - 1` will be 0.

Missing functionality:
- The code assumes that `can_distribute(mid)` is defined and works correctly within the given constraints. If `can_distribute(mid)` is not implemented or does not work as expected, the function behavior could be incorrect.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and n is a positive integer representing the number of plates such that 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #`a // x + b // x >= n` where `x` is an unspecified variable, `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_distribute` accepts an integer `x` and returns `True` if the sum of the integer division of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. Here, `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the number of plates, with the constraints 1 <= a, b <= 100 and 2 <= n <= a + b. The function does not modify the values of `a`, `b`, or `n`; it only evaluates the given condition. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 1 or when `x` is greater than `a + b`, which would always result in `False` since `a // 1 + b // 1 = a + b` and `a + b` cannot be greater than or equal to `n` if `n > a + b`. The function does not handle negative values for `a`, `b`, or `n`, nor does it check if `x` is a non-integer or zero.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
