The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Previously, `mid` was defined as `(low + high) // 2`. Therefore, after updating `low` to `mid + 1`, the value of `low` becomes `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.

The state of `high` and `mid` remains unchanged. So, `high` is still the original value, and `mid` is still `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is the original value, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
