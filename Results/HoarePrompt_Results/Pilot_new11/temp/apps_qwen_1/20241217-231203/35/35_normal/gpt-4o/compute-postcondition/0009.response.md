The code `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. The values of `low` and `high` are not specified in the initial state, so we will keep them as they are. The variable `mid` is newly introduced and assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` is the original value, `high` is the original value, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
