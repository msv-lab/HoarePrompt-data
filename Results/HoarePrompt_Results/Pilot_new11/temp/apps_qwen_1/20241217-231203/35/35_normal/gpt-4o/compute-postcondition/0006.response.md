The value of `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. According to the initial state, `mid` is 1. Therefore, `high` is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `low` is 1, `high` is 1, `mid` is 1, and `can_distribute(mid)` is false**
