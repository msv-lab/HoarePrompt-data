To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\).
- `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\).
- `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\).
- If `can_distribute(mid)` returns True, then `low` is 2 and `high` is 2. Otherwise, `low` is 1 and `high` is 1.
- `mid` remains 1.

The `while` loop condition is `while low < high:`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial States:**
   - `low` can either be 1 or 2.
   - `high` can either be 1 or 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `low < high`.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Continue:**
   - For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than `high`.
   - Given that `low` and `high` are both set to 1 in the initial state, the only way for the loop to continue is if the values of `low` and `high` change from 1 to some other values where `low < high`.

3. **Possible Values:**
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns True, then `low` is set to 2 and `high` is set to 2, making `low == high` and breaking the loop.
   - If `can_distribute(mid)` returns False, then `low` remains 1 and `high` remains 1, keeping `low == high` and breaking the loop.
   
Since the only way to have `low < high` is to have `low` and `high` initialized to 1 and then changed to different values, and given the constraints, the only scenario that allows `low < high` is if `low` is set to 1 and `high` is set to 2 (or vice versa) after an iteration.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `low` and `high` are set up such that `low < high`. Given the constraints and the current state where `low` and `high` are both 1, we need to ensure that they are set to different values where `low < high`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `low` and `high` are different, with `low < high`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\), `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\), `mid` remains 1, and `low` is 1 while `high` is 2.**

This ensures that `low < high`, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
