Let's analyze the given state and the `while True` loop step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

### Loop:
```
while True:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The `while True` loop runs indefinitely as long as it is not explicitly broken out of. Since there are no conditions in the loop itself (other than the infinite `True` condition), the only way to adjust the state so that the loop can proceed is to ensure that the loop is not immediately halted due to external conditions. However, since this is an infinite loop, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to proceed.

### Conclusion:
No state needs to be adjusted because the `while True` loop will always execute as long as the program flow reaches it.

### Answer:
State: **`n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`**
