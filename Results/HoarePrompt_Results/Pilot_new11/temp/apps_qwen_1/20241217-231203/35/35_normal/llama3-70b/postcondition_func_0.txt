The function reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 100 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \). It then finds the largest integer \( x \) such that \( a \geq x \), \( b \geq x \), and \( a - x + (b - x) \geq x \). The function prints this integer \( x \) as the output. The function handles edge cases where \( a \) or \( b \) might be equal to 1, and ensures that \( n \) is always valid within the given constraints. If no such \( x \) exists, the function will decrement \( x \) until it finds a valid solution or reaches 1.
