The code `print('maybe')` simply prints the string 'maybe' to the console. This does not change any variable values or states. The output of the print function is not stored in any variable, so the variables `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b), `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, and `ratings` remains an empty list**
