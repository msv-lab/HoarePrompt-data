The code assigns `False` to the variable `is_rated`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `ratings`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is `False`**
