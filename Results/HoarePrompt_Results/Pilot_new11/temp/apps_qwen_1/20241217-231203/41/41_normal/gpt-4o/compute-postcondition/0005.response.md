The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. This operation affects the variables `a` and `b`, while the initial conditions of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
