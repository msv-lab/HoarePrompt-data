Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is an integer starting from `i + 1`. If for any `j` in the range, the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is met, then `unrated` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. If the condition is never met for any `j` in the range, `unrated` remains `False` after the loop completes.**
