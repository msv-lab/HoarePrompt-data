To determine the final output state of the given loop, let's analyze the loop and its behavior step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is an integer greater than 1.
- \( i \) starts at 1.
- \( unrated \) is initially set to `False`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
        unrated = False
        break
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs over each element \( j \) starting from \( i+1 \) to \( n-1 \).
   - For each \( j \), it checks if `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`.
   - If both conditions are met, it sets `unrated` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If neither condition is met for any \( j \), the loop continues to the next iteration.

2. **Final Values After Loop Execution**:
   - If the loop finds any \( j \) such that the conditions are met, `unrated` will be set to `False` and the loop will exit immediately.
   - If the loop completes without finding any \( j \) that satisfies the conditions, `unrated` will remain `True`.

### Output State:

- If the loop finds at least one \( j \) such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, `unrated` will be `False`.
- If the loop does not find any such \( j \), `unrated` will be `True`.

Since the loop iterates over all possible values of \( j \) starting from \( i+1 \) to \( n-1 \), the final value of `unrated` depends only on whether any such \( j \) exists.

### Conclusion:

- If any \( j \) satisfies the conditions, `unrated` will be `False`.
- If no such \( j \) exists, `unrated` will be `True`.

Thus, the final output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`unrated` is `False` if there exists a `j` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`; otherwise, `unrated` is `True`.**
