Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(i + 1, n)` means the loop will start from `i + 1` up to but not including `n`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `unrated` remains False (though this state doesn't directly affect the loop's execution).

3. **Determine the Range for the Loop**:
   - The loop starts from `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - The loop ends just before `n`.

4. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be values of `j` in the range `[2, n)`.
   - This means `n` must be greater than 2 because if `n` were 2 or less, there would be no values of `j` in the specified range.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `n` accordingly.
   - `i` is already set to 1, which is correct as per the given initial state.
   - `unrated` being False does not affect the loop execution, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.

Therefore, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `unrated` remains False**
