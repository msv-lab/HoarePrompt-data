The code sets `is_unrated` to `True`. Since this is the same value it already had, there is no change. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`, `i` is 3**
