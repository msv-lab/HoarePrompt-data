Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False` if there exists at least one pair `(i, j)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`. If `ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]`, then `unrated` becomes `False`. Otherwise, the value of `unrated` remains unchanged.***
