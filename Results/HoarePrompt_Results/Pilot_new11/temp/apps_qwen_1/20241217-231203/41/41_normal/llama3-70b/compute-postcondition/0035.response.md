The code `break` is executed inside a loop or conditional statement, but its effect is to exit that loop or conditional statement. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `unrated` remain unchanged. The condition that made `unrated` become False also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `unrated` is False**
