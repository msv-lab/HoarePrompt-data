The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most inner block it is in. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or block it is part of, but it does not change the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `unrated`, `ratings_before`, or `ratings_after`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `unrated` is False, the ratings before and after at index `i` satisfy the condition: `ratings_before[i] < ratings_after[i]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, where `j` is an index different from `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or block.**
