Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False`, `i` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is an integer with the current value of `j` being `i + 2`. If `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no change occurs.***
