State before the loop starts: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings` is an empty list; `is_rated` is `False`; `is_unrated` is `False`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop will run for `n` iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `range(n)`, meaning it will run `n` times starting from 0 to `n-1`.
3. Since `n` is given as an integer between 2 and 1000, it already satisfies this condition.
4. The variable `ratings` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution directly.
5. The states of `is_rated` and `is_unrated` being `False` do not impact the loop's execution either.

Given these points, we only need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure it is at least 1 (since the loop runs `n` times).

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`**
