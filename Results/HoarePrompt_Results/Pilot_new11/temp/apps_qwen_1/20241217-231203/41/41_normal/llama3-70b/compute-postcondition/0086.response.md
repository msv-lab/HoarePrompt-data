Postcondition: ***`unrated` is `False` if there exists at least one pair \((i, j)\) such that \(ratings\_before[i] < ratings\_after[j]\) and \(ratings\_after[i] > ratings\_after[j]\), otherwise `unrated` is `True`. `i` is `i + 1`, and `rated` is `True`.*** 

Explanation:
- The if condition checks if `ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]`.
- In the if part, if the condition is true, `unrated` remains as it is (i.e., it stays `False` if it was `False` due to some previous condition, or it remains `True` if it was `True`), `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), and `rated` is set to `True`. Additionally, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.

Thus, the overall postcondition after executing the if-else block is the same as the postcondition of the if part, ensuring that the `unrated` status and the other variables (`i` and `rated`) reflect the conditions specified.
