The code prints 'unrated', but this action does not change any of the variables. The values of `n`, `ratings`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `ratings` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b), `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `True`**
