Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote according to the given ratio (1:2:4). The function reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is the minimum value among \(a\), \(b // 2\), and \(c // 4\). This ensures that the number of lemons is within the limits set by the available fruits and the required ratio. The total number of fruits used is calculated as \(1 \times \text{max\_lemons} + 2 \times \text{max\_lemons} + 4 \times \text{max\_lemons}\), which simplifies to \(7 \times \text{max\_lemons}\). Finally, it prints the result. Given the problem description and the examples, the code handles all potential cases correctly and produces the expected output.
