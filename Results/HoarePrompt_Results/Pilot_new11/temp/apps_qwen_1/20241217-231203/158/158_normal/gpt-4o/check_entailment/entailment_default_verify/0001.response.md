Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote according to the given ratio (1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively). The program calculates the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) that can be used, ensuring that the corresponding number of apples and pears can also be used in the required quantities. The total number of fruits used is then calculated and printed. The output hints confirm that the program handles the specified cases correctly, and there is no indication that the program fails to meet the problem description or the requirements outlined in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
