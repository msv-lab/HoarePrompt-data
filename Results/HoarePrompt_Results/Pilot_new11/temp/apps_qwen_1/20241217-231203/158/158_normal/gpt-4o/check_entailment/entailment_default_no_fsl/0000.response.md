Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote while maintaining the required ratio of 1:2:4. The code uses the minimum value among the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears to determine how many sets of the required ratio can be made. This ensures that the fruits are used in the correct proportions and no fruit is broken or cut. The code then calculates the total number of fruits used and prints it. Given the constraints and the examples provided, the code handles all cases correctly as per the problem description.
