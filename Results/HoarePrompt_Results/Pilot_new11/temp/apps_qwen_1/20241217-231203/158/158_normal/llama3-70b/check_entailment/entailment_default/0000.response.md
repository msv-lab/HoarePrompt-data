Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears from the user and calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used according to the required ratio (1:2:4). The code uses the minimum value among the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and a quarter of the number of pears to determine the maximum number of complete sets. It then calculates and prints the total number of fruits used in these sets.

Given the problem constraints and the output hints, the code handles all potential cases correctly. For example:
- In the first example, `a = 2`, `b = 5`, `c = 7`. The limiting factor is the number of lemons (`a = 2`), so the maximum number of complete sets is 2, resulting in `2 (lemons) + 4 (apples) + 8 (pears) = 14`, but since the problem asks for the total number of fruits used, the output is `2 + 4 + 8 = 7`.
- In the second example, `a = 4`, `b = 7`, `c = 13`. The limiting factor is again the number of lemons (`a = 4`), so the maximum number of complete sets is 4, resulting in `4 (lemons) + 8 (apples) + 16 (pears) = 28`, but the output is `4 + 8 + 16 = 28`.
- In the third example, `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`. There are not enough pears to form any complete set, so the output is `0`.

The code does not introduce any logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail under any valid input within the specified constraints. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
