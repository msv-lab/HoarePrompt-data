Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the given ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. The key logic in the program is determining the limiting factor among lemons, apples, and pears by using `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available number of apples and pears required for the ratio. The total number of fruits used is then calculated correctly as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. The annotated version supports this reasoning and confirms that the program handles all potential cases correctly within the given constraints.
