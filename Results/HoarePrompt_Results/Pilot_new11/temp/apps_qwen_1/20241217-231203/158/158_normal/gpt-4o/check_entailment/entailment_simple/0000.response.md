Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes three inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. Each input is read using `int(input())` and stored in variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This part of the program correctly handles the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Determination of Maximum Number of Lemons to Use**: The program calculates the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) that can be used in the compote. This is determined by taking the minimum of three values: `a` (the number of lemons), `b // 2` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available apples), and `c // 4` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available pears). This ensures that the compote is made in the required ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears.

3. **Calculation of Total Fruits**: The program then calculates the total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used in the compote by multiplying the `max_lemons` by 1, 2, and 4 respectively and summing these values. This calculation is correct because it adheres to the required ratio.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote. If no fruits can be used (i.e., `max_lemons` is 0), it correctly outputs 0.

Since the program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description and handles all cases as specified, it is deemed correct.
