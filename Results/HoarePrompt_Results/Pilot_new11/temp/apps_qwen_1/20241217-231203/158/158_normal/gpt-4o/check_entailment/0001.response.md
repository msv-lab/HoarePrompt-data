Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote according to the given ratio (1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively). The program calculates the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) that can be used, ensuring that the corresponding number of apples and pears can also be used in the required quantities. The total number of fruits used is then calculated and printed.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For any valid input where the number of lemons, apples, and pears are within the specified range (1 to 1000), the program will output the correct maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote. If there are not enough apples or pears to meet the ratio, the program correctly outputs 0. Therefore, the program is correct for all given potential cases.
