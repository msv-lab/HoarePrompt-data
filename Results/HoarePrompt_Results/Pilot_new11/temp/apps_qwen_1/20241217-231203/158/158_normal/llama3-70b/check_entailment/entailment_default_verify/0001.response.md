Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote by determining the limiting factor (the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`) and then computing the corresponding number of apples and pears. The program handles all potential cases correctly based on the given constraints and examples. The output hints confirm that the program behaves as expected, reading three non-negative integers and printing the sum of the minimum number of lemons, twice that number of apples, and four times that number of pears. Since the program works correctly for all provided examples and follows the problem description accurately, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
