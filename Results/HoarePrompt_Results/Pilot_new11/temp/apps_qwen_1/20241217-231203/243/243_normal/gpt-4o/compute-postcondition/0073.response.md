`right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The previous values of `low`, `high`, `left`, and `mid` are still valid, but `right` now holds the value of `mid + 1`. The function `func_1` and its relation to `left` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + 1`, and `func_1(left) == m`.**
