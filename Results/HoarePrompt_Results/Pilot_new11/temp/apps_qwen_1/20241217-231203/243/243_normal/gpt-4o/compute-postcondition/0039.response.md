The code assigns the value of `mid` to `left`. The previous value of `mid` is \((7 \times m + 2)\). Therefore, `left` is now \((7 \times m + 2)\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \((7 \times m + 2)\), `left` is \((7 \times m + 2)\)**
