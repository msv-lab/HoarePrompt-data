`left` is decremented by 1. The value of `left` is now `mid - 1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` and must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, `left` is equal to `mid - 1**
