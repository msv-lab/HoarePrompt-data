The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` creates a list of integers starting from `left + 1` up to, but not including, `right`. 

Given the initial state:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`
- `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`
- `right` is \((5 \times m + 1)\)
- `func_1(right)` must return `m`

After executing the line `result = list(range(left + 1, right))`, the `result` variable now contains a list of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. So, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\); `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\); `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`; `right` is \((5 \times m + 1)\); `func_1(right)` must return `m`.**
