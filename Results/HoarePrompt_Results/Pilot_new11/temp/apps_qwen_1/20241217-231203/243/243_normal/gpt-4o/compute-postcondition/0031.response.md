Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `low` is set to \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1\) and `high` is set to \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1\). Otherwise, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, `right` is \(5 \times m + 1\), and `func_1(right)` returns `m`.***
