The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\) and uses a binary search approach to find a range of integers `n` for which `n!` (n factorial) ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. It initializes `low` and `high` to search within a predefined range and iteratively narrows down the search space. If it finds a value `mid` such that `func_1(mid)` equals `m`, it then expands the search to find the exact range of numbers that satisfy the condition. If `low` exceeds `high` without finding such a range, it returns an empty list. The function ultimately returns either a range of integers satisfying the condition or an empty list if no such range is found.
