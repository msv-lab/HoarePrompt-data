The value of `n` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its original value to `n + 1`. The other variables (`m`, `count`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` is an integer value between 1 and 100,000; `count` is the largest integer such that \(5^{\text{count}}\) is less than or equal to `m`; `n` is the original value of `n` plus 1; `ans` is a list containing `[1, n]`.**
