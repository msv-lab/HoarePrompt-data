The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` was previously \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\). The values of `m`, `low`, `result`, `mid`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged. The state of `zeroes` is still the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, which is greater than `m`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and `zeroes` is greater than `m`.**
