Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition given is `while True:`. This means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no explicit conditions to break out of the loop.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `m` is an integer value between 1 and 100,000.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `n` is 1.

3. **Loop Execution**: Since the loop is `while True`, it will execute one more time without any specific termination condition based on the provided variables (`m`, `count`, and `n`). There are no conditions in the loop that depend on these variables to determine when to stop.

4. **Adjusting States**: Given that the loop is `while True`, it will always execute another iteration regardless of the current values of `m`, `count`, and `n`.

Since the loop will always execute another iteration due to `while True`, we do not need to adjust any of the given states.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is an integer value between 1 and 100,000, `count` is 0, and `n` is 1**
