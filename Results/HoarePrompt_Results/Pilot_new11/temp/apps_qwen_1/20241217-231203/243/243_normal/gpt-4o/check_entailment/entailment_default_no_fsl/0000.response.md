Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when there are no values of \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly \( m \) trailing zeroes. According to the output hints for `func_2`, if the binary search does not find a range of integers that satisfy the condition, it returns an empty list. However, the problem description requires the program to output `0` in such cases instead of an empty list. For example, if \( m = 5 \), there are no values of \( n \) such that \( n! \) ends with exactly 5 trailing zeroes, so the correct output should be:

```
0
```

But the current implementation will output:

```
0
```

as a string, which is not following the format specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
