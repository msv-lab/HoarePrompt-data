The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most nested block. In this context, since there is no loop or conditional block that `break` is explicitly part of in the given code snippet, the only thing that changes is the indication that we break out of the most internal loop or structure we were inside. However, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\); `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`; `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\); `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`; `right` is \((5 \times m + 1)\); `func_1(right)` must return `m`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
