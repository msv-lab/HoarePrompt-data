You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number whose factorial's trailing zeroes are to be counted.
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        
        power_of_5 *= 5
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is the total sum of `n // (original_power_of_5 * 5^k)` for each iteration where `k` ranges from 0 to the number of iterations, `n` is unchanged, `power_of_5` is `original_power_of_5 * 5^k` for the last iteration where `n >= original_power_of_5 * 5^k`, and `n` must be less than `original_power_of_5 * 5^(k+1)` for the last iteration.
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total sum of n // (original_power_of_5 * 5^k) for each iteration where k ranges from 0 to the number of iterations, with n being less than original_power_of_5 * 5^(k+1) for the last iteration

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100 000.
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    low, high = 0, 5 * (m + 1)
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). `low` is the final value determined by the binary search process, and `high` is also the final value determined by the same process. `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, and `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right) == m` and all values between `right - 1` and `right` do not satisfy `func_1(x) == m`. `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` where `mid` is the midpoint of `low` and `high` at the end of the loop. If `zeroes` is equal to `m`, the loop terminates, and `result` is set to the range of values from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. If `zeroes` does not equal `m`, the loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, and `result` remains an empty list.
    return result
    #`The program returns an empty list because low exceeds high, and no values in the specified range satisfy func_1(x) == m`


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
