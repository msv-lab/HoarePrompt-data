The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the code, it simply means that we are breaking out of an implicit loop or conditional that was present before this line.

Given the initial state:
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`
- `left` is `low - 1`
- `right` is `mid + n`
- `result` is a list created by the range from `low` to `mid + n`

Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`, `left` is `low - 1`, `right` is `mid + n`, and `result` is a list created by the range from `low` to `mid + n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
