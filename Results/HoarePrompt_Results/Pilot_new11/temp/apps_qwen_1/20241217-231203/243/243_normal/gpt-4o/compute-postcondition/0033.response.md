To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues: `low <= high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- \(m\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` is either \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\) or \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2 - 1)\).
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\).
- `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, and `right` is \(5 \times m + 1\).
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` where `mid = (5 \times m + 1) // 2`.

The loop condition `low <= high` will continue to be true if `low` is still less than or equal to `high`. 

Since the loop updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `zeroes` with `m`, we need to consider the following cases:

1. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, `low` is updated to \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\).
2. If `zeroes` is greater than `m`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and the loop will terminate as the condition `low <= high` will no longer hold since `low` will exceed `high`.

For the loop to continue, `zeroes` must be less than `m`, and `low` should be updated to \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\).

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `low` should be \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\).

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is either an empty list or a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` where `mid = (5 \times m + 1) // 2`.**
