The given code initializes an empty list named `result`. This operation does not affect the values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, or `zeroes`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `result` list.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `result` is an empty list**
