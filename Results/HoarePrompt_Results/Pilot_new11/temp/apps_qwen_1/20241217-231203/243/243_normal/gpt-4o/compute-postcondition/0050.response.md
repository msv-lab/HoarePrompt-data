Let's analyze the given code and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `func_1(right) == m`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `right` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration.

### Loop Condition Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `right` has been increased by 1 compared to the value at the start of the previous iteration.

### Determining the Next State
Since `right` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, let's denote the value of `right` at the end of the previous iteration as `right_prev`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `right` will be `right_prev + 1`.

To satisfy the loop condition `func_1(right) == m` in the next iteration, we need:
\[ func_1(right_prev + 1) == m \]

### Adjusted States
- The value of `m` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `right` must be such that when it is passed to `func_1`, the result is `m`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
- `right` must be such that `func_1(right) == m`.

### Final Answer
State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\) and `right` must be such that `func_1(right) == m`**
