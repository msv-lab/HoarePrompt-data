To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop and the given states step by step.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while func_1(left) == m:
```

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\)
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`
- `mid` is \(7 \times m + 2\)
- `left` is \(7 \times m\)

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must hold true. Since we don't know the exact implementation of `func_1`, we must assume that the function returns a value based on the input `left`.

Since the loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`, and the condition held true in the previous iteration (otherwise the loop would have terminated), for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(left)` must still return `m` when evaluated again in the next iteration.

There are no changes to `m`, `low`, `high`, `result`, `zeroes`, `mid`, or `left` mentioned that would affect the loop condition directly. The only variable that could change and potentially break the loop condition is `left`, but since `left` is defined as \(7 \times m\) and there's no operation changing this value within the loop, `left` remains the same.

Therefore, the loop condition `func_1(left) == m` is likely to remain true unless there is some external factor or additional logic inside the loop body that alters `m` or `func_1`'s behavior.

Since no specific modifications to the states are required to ensure the loop continues, the states do not need to be adjusted beyond what is already provided.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is \(((5 \times m + 1) // 2) + 1\), `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1((7 \times m + 2))`, `mid` is \(7 \times m + 2\), `left` is \(7 \times m\)**
