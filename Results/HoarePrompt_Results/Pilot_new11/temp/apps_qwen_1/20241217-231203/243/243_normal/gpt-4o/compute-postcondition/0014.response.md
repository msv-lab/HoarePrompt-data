To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions inside the `while` loop and the current state:

The loop condition is:
```python
while func_1(left) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the current state:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\)
- `low` is 0
- `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\)
- `result` is an empty list
- `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\)
- `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`
- `zeroes` is less than `m`
- `left` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must be true.

Since `zeroes` (which is `func_1(mid)`) is less than `m`, and `left` is equal to `mid`, the function `func_1(left)` should return a value that equals `m`. However, given the information, we do not have any direct way to adjust the values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, or `left` to change the outcome of `func_1(left)` directly in the context provided.

Therefore, based on the given information, no specific state adjustments are required to ensure that the loop can execute at least one more time. The loop condition itself is dependent on the output of `func_1(left)`, and without knowing more about the behavior of `func_1`, we cannot guarantee a specific adjustment.

Thus, the program state remains as provided.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times m + 1\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, and `zeroes` is less than `m`; `left` is \((5 \times m + 1) // 2**
