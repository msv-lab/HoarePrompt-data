Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given integer `n`.
   - It uses a loop to count how many times 5 divides `n` (and its multiples), which directly corresponds to the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function finds all integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes.
   - It performs a binary search to efficiently narrow down the range of possible values for `n`.
   - When it finds a middle point `mid` such that `func_1(mid) == m`, it further narrows down the range by checking values just below and above `mid` to find the exact range of values for `n`.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - It reads the input `m` and calls `func_2(m)` to get the list of integers `n` that satisfy the condition.
   - It prints the length of the resulting list followed by the list itself in increasing order.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read as an integer `m`.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - The binary search is performed between `low = 0` and `high = 5 * (m + 1)`. This range ensures that the search space is large enough to cover all possible values of `n` whose factorials could end with `m` trailing zeroes.
   - The search is guided by comparing the number of trailing zeroes (`zeroes`) with `m`. If `zeroes` is less than `m`, the lower bound is adjusted; if `zeroes` is greater than `m`, the upper bound is adjusted.
   - Once `zeroes` equals `m`, it further narrows down the range by decrementing `left` and incrementing `right` to find the exact bounds.

3. **Result Calculation:**
   - After finding the bounds, it constructs the list of integers within this range that satisfy the condition.
   - The length of this list is printed, followed by the list itself.

### Correctness Verification:

- The binary search approach ensures that the solution is found efficiently.
- The `func_1` function accurately computes the number of trailing zeroes, ensuring the binary search works correctly.
- The main program logic correctly handles the output format, printing the number of valid `n` values followed by the values themselves in increasing order.

Given the problem constraints and the provided solution, the program always meets the requirements as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
