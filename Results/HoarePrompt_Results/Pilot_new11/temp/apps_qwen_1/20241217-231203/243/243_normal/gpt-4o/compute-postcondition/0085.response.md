Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\). `low` is the final value determined by the binary search process, and `high` is also the final value determined by the same process. `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` is the largest value such that `func_1(left) == m`, and `right` is the smallest value such that `func_1(right) == m` and all values between `right - 1` and `right` do not satisfy `func_1(x) == m`. `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)` where `mid` is the midpoint of `low` and `high` at the end of the loop. If `zeroes` is equal to `m`, the loop terminates, and `result` is set to the range of values from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. If `zeroes` does not equal `m`, the loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, and `result` remains an empty list.**

This output state encapsulates the final values and relationships of the variables after the loop has executed, including the possible values of `low` and `high` based on the binary search process, the determination of `left` and `right` for the range of values satisfying `func_1(x) == m`, and the condition under which `result` is populated with the desired range of integers.
