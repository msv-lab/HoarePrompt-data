digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specific base, and base is an integer representing the base of the digits (where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40). Additionally, there will be two calls to this function, each with its own set of digits and base, representing two different numbers X and Y as described in the problem statement.
