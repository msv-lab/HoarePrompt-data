`decimal_value` is multiplied by `base` and then the `digit` is added. The initial value of `decimal_value` is 0, so when it is multiplied by `base`, it remains 0. Adding `digit` (where `digit` is an element from `digits`) to 0 results in `decimal_value` being equal to `digit`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`decimal_value` is `digit`, `digits` must have at least one element**
