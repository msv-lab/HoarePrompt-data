Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input to obtain the number of digits (`n` and `m`) and the respective bases (`base_x` and `base_y`) for both numbers X and Y.
   - It then reads the digits of X and Y, storing them in lists (`digits_x` and `digits_y`).

2. **Base Conversion**:
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to convert the digits of X and Y from their respective bases to decimal. This function correctly handles the conversion by iterating through the digits and calculating the decimal value.
   - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to convert the number from the given base to decimal and leaves the `digits` list empty upon completion.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After converting the numbers to decimal, the program compares `decimal_x` and `decimal_y`.
   - Based on the comparison, it outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') as specified in the problem description.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Compliance with Input Format**: The program correctly handles the input format, including reading the number of digits, bases, and the digits themselves.
- **Base Conversion Function**: The `func_1` function correctly converts the number from the specified base to decimal. It iterates through the digits and calculates the decimal value using the formula \( \text{decimal\_value} = \text{decimal\_value} \times \text{base} + \text{digit} \).
- **Comparison Logic**: The program correctly compares the decimal values of X and Y and outputs the appropriate character based on the comparison.

### Conclusion:

Given the assumptions about valid inputs, the provided program meets all the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
