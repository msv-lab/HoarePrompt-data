Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `digits` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `digit` is the second element in the `digits` list.
   - `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive.
   - `result` is the first element of the `digits` list multiplied by `base` plus the second element of the `digits` list.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each `digit` in the `digits` list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `digit` is the second element of the list.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `digit` needs to be set to the next element in the `digits` list.
   - The `result` should be updated according to the new `digit`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `digit` is the second element in the list, for the next iteration, `digit` will be the third element.
   - The `result` should be updated to include the third element of the list.

5. **Formulating the New State:**
   - `digits` remains the same as it is a non-empty list.
   - `digit` will be the third element of the list.
   - `base` remains the same.
   - `result` will be updated to include the third element of the list.

Based on the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `digit` is the third element in the `digits` list, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, `result` is the sum of the first two elements of the `digits` list multiplied by `base` plus the third element of the `digits` list**
