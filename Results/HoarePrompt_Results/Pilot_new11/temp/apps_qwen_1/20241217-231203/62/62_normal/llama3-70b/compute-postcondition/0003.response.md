Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `digits` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list.
   - `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive.
   - `result` is equal to `digit`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The for loop iterates over each element in the `digits` list.
   - During the first iteration, `digit` was set to the first element of `digits`, and `result` was initialized to this value.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration, `digit` would now be set to the second element of the `digits` list (since it is iterating through the list).
   - `result` remains unchanged from the initial value, which is the first element of `digits`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `digit` needs to be set to the next element in the `digits` list.
   - Therefore, `digit` should be the second element of the `digits` list.
   - `result` should still hold the value of the first element of the `digits` list since no operation modifying `result` is mentioned in the loop body.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `digits` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `digit` becomes the second element of `digits`.
   - `result` remains the first element of `digits`.

Based on this analysis, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `digit` is the second element in the `digits` list, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, `result` is the first element of the `digits` list**
