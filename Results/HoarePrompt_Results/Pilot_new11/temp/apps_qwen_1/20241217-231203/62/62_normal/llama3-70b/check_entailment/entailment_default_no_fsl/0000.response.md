Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the bases \(b_x\) and \(b_y\) are the same, although the problem description explicitly states that \(b_x \neq b_y\). This means the code will run without error, but it will not meet the problem requirements for every potential case. Specifically, the code will produce the correct output only if the bases are different. If the bases are the same, the code will still execute, but it will not fulfill the problem's conditions, leading to incorrect behavior for inputs where \(b_x = b_y\).

To fix this, you would need to add a condition at the beginning of the program to check if \(b_x\) is equal to \(b_y\), and if so, handle this case appropriately, possibly by raising an error or providing a specific message indicating that the bases must be different.
