State before the loop starts: `decimal_value` is 0

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. For the loop to execute, `digits` must contain at least one element. The loop iterates over each `digit` in `digits`, so the initial value of `decimal_value` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's ability to run, but it ensures that the loop will start with an initial value.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `digits` has at least one element.
