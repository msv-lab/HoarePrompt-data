Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, `result` is the integer represented by the list `digits` in the given base `base`.** 

### Explanation:
- **`digits`**: The list `digits` represents the digits of a number in a given base. Since the loop iterates through each digit in the list exactly once, the state of `digits` remains unchanged.
- **`base`**: The value of `base` remains the same throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`result`**: The loop updates `result` in each iteration using the formula `result = result * base + digit`. After all iterations, `result` contains the integer value that the list `digits` represents in the given base `base`. This is equivalent to converting the list of digits from the specified base to its decimal (base 10) representation.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `digits` is an empty list), then:
- `digits` is an empty list.
- `base` remains the same.
- `result` is 0 because no digits are processed.

However, since the problem specifies that the output state includes what is needed for the loop to execute at least that number of times, we focus on the general case where the list `digits` is non-empty.
