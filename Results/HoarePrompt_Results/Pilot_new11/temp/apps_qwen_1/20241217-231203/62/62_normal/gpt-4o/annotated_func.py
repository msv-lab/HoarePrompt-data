#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specific base, and base is an integer representing the base of the digits (where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40). Additionally, there will be two calls to this function, each with its own set of digits and base, representing two different numbers X and Y as described in the problem statement.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `decimal_value` is the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in `digits`, `digits` is an empty list.
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns decimal_value which is the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in an empty list 'digits'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `digits` and an integer `base`, and converts the number represented by `digits` in the specified `base` into its decimal form. After processing, the `digits` list is left empty. The function returns the decimal representation of the number. Potential edge cases include the possibility that the `digits` list could be empty, in which case the function would still correctly return 0. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it accurately converts the number from the given base to decimal and leaves the `digits` list empty upon completion.
