Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the `func_1` function converts the numbers from their respective bases to base 10, and the main program then compares these base 10 values. This approach is incorrect according to the problem description, which requires comparing the numbers in their original bases, not after converting them to base 10.

The annotated version provides clear evidence that the program is performing a base-10 conversion and then comparing these converted values, rather than comparing the numbers in their original bases. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
