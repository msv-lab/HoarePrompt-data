According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` from the `additional_marks` list. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `additional_marks` that satisfy the condition `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is an index less than `n`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `marks` is a non-empty list
- `need_x` is `False`
- `need_y` is `False`
- `additional_marks` is a list with at least 1 element

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one element in `additional_marks` that satisfies the condition `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `j` used in the previous iteration, we assume that `additional_marks` still contains at least one valid element `j` that can be processed in this iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list with at least 1 element that can be processed (i.e., `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`).**
