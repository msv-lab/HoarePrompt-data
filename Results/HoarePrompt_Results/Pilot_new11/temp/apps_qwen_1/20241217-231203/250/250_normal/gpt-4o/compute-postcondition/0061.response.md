Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list with at least one less element than before, `y_found` is False. If `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark - y`. If none of these conditions are met, then `marks` has at least one less element and `y_found` remains False.***
