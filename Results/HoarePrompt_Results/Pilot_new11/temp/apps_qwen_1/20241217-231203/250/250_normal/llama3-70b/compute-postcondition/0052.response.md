`need_y` is explicitly set to `True`. The value of `need_x` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not affect it. The value of `i` and `n` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, and `n` is greater than `i`. `need_x` and `need_y` are both `True`.**
