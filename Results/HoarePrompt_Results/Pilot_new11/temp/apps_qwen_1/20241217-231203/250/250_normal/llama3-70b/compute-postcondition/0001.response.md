The code `marks = set(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a set from these integers. The variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation.

Since the input is not provided, let's denote the input as a sequence of integers separated by spaces, and the resulting set will be a set of these integers.

Let's assume the input is `a b c d` (where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers).

After executing the code:
- `marks` will be a set containing `{a, b, c, d}`.
- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 10^5, `l` is between 2 and 10^9, `x` is less than `y` and both are between 1 and `l`, `marks` is a set of integers from the input, `x` is less than `y`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers**
