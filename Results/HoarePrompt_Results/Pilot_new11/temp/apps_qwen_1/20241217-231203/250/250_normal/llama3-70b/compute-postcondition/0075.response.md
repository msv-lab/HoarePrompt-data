Postcondition: ***`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list with at least 1 element. If `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, `additional_marks` includes the new element `i + j`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
