`x_found` is set to `True`. The value of `x` does not change, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `False`, `x_found` is `True`.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `False`, `x_found` is `True`**
