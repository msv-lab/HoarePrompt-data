Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `marks` is a non-empty list.
- `need_x` is `False`.
- `need_y` is `False`.
- `additional_marks` contains all unique elements such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks` for any `j` in `additional_marks`.

### Analysis of the For Loop:
The for loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list. The loop variable `i` takes the value of each element in `marks` in sequence.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is the next element in the `marks` list, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the subsequent element in the list.

2. **Determine the Updated State of `n`:**
   - The variable `n` does not depend on the loop variable `i`, but rather it is an independent condition that must hold true. Therefore, `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the Updated State of `marks`:**
   - Since `i` is removed from `marks` at the end of each iteration (as `i` is processed), the `marks` list will have one less element than before the iteration started.

4. **Determine the Updated State of `need_x` and `need_y`:**
   - The variables `need_x` and `need_y` do not change based on the loop variable `i`. They remain as they were in the previous iteration.

5. **Determine the Updated State of `additional_marks`:**
   - The set `additional_marks` is not directly modified by the loop itself. However, if `i` was part of `additional_marks` before the iteration, it is no longer in `additional_marks` after the iteration. Thus, `additional_marks` should be updated accordingly.

### Final Adjusted States:
- `i` will be the next element in the `marks` list.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `marks` will be the original `marks` list minus the current `i`.
- `need_x` remains `False`.
- `need_y` remains `False`.
- `additional_marks` will be the original `additional_marks` set minus the current `i`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list minus the current `i`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` contains all unique elements such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks` for any `j` in `additional_marks` minus the current `i`**.
