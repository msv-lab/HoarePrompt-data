Postcondition: ***`i` is an index less than `n`, and `marks[j+1] - marks[i]` equals either `x` or `y`. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True` and `need_y` remains unchanged. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` does not equal `x`, the condition of `need_x` and `need_y` remains as per the precondition.***
