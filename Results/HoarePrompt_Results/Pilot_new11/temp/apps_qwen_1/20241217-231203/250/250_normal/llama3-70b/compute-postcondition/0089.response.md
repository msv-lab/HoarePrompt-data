`i` is appended to `additional_marks` as `i + j`. The values of `n`, `marks`, `need_x`, `need_y`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `additional_marks` now contains its original elements plus `i + j`.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` contains at least one element and `i + j`.**
