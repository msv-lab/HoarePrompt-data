`need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `need_x` is unchanged and still depends on the condition involving `marks[j] - marks[i]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `marks`, and the condition for `need_x` remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, `n` is greater than `i`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` determines if `need_x` remains `True` and `need_y` remains unchanged.**
