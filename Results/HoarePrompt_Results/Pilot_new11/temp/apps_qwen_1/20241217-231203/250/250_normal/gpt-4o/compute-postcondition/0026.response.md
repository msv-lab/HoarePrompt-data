Postcondition: **`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `True`, and `x_found` is `True` if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is found in `marks_set`.** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and the if part already sets `y_found` to `True`, the overall postcondition simply follows the condition specified in the if part, as there is no alternative outcome from the else part to consider.
