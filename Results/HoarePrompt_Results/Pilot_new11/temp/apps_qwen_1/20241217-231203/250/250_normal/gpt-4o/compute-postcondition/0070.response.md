The code adds `mark + y` to the set `new_marks`. The precondition does not specify the initial contents of `new_marks`, so we only know that `mark + y` has been added to it. The other parts of the precondition (regarding `marks` and the conditions involving `mark + x + y`, `mark + x - y`, and `mark - x + y`) do not affect the output state of `new_marks`.

Output State: **`new_marks` contains the element `mark + y`**
