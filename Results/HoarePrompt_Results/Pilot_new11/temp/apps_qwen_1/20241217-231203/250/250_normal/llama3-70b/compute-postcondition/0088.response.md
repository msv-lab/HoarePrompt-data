Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.
   - If `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` includes `i + j`. Otherwise, the condition does not change the state of `additional_marks`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `marks` is a non-empty list.
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` contains at least one element.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.

3. **Analysis of Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `additional_marks`.
   - For each `j` in `additional_marks`, the loop body is executed, but since the problem statement does not specify what happens inside the loop body, we focus on how the loop modifies the states.

4. **State After Each Iteration:**
   - The key point is that the loop will continue as long as `additional_marks` contains elements. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the state of `additional_marks`.

5. **Final States for Next Iteration:**
   - `i` remains the same because it is not modified by the loop.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 because the loop does not affect this value.
   - `marks` remains a non-empty list because the loop does not affect this value.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` remain `False` because the loop does not affect these values.
   - `additional_marks` should contain at least one element for the loop to continue. Since the problem does not specify any modification of `additional_marks` within the loop, we assume `additional_marks` still contains at least one element.

**Answer:**

State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` contains at least one element.**
