`additional_marks` is appended with the value of `x`. The value of `i` remains less than `n`, `need_x` is still `False`, and `need_y` is still `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. The state of `additional_marks` is updated to include `x`.

Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, and `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`**
