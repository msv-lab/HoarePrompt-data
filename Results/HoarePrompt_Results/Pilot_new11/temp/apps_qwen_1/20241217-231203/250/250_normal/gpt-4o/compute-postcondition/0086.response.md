Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list that may contain any number of elements, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `marks_set` is the set of unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, and `result` is a list containing the values `[x, y]` since `y_found` is `False` within the if block and there is no else part that changes these conditions.***
