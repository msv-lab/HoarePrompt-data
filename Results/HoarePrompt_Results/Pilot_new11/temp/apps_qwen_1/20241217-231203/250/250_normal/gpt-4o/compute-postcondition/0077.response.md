The code `print(1)` simply prints the integer `1` to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that may contain any number of elements, `y_found` is `False` or `True`, `new_marks` contains the set of elements derived from the operations involving `x` and `y` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `marks_set` is the set of unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, and `new_marks` is non-empty; 1 is printed to the console.**
