Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is the next element in the `marks` list.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `marks` is a non-empty list.
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` contains at least one element plus the new element `i + j` if `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and not in `marks`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `j` in `additional_marks`, the loop body is executed (omitted here).

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `additional_marks`, we need to consider what happens to `additional_marks` after one iteration.
   - Each `j` is processed in the loop, but it does not inherently change the size of `additional_marks` unless there is an external condition within the loop body that removes elements from `additional_marks`.

5. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `marks` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `need_x` remains `False` as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `need_y` remains `False` as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `additional_marks` might change if an element is removed based on some condition within the loop body. However, since no such condition is specified, we assume `additional_marks` remains unchanged.

Given these points, for the loop to execute one more time, the only thing that needs to be considered is that `additional_marks` must still contain at least one element for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` contains at least one element.**
