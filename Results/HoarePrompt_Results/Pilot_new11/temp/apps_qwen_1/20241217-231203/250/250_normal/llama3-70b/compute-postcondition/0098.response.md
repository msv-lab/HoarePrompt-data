`additional_marks` has its value updated by appending `i + j` to it. Since `i` is the next element in the `marks` list and `j` is not defined, we can only express `i + j` in this form. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list without the current `i`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is the original list with the appended value `i + j`.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list without the current `i`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is the original list with the appended value `i + j`.**
