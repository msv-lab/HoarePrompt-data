`additional_marks` appends the value of `i + j`. Since `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`, the value of `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list without the current `i`, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is not empty and now includes `i + j`, and `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`**
