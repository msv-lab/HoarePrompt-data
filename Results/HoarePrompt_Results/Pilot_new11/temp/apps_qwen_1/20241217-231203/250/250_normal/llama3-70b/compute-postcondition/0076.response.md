Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `i` is an index less than `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `marks` is a non-empty list.
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` is a list with at least 1 element.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`.

3. **Loop Body (Omitted):**
   - The loop body checks if `i + j <= l` and if `i + j` is not already in `marks`.
   - If both conditions are met, `additional_marks` includes the new element `i + j`.
   - If either condition is not met, the state of the program remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `additional_marks`, the key states to adjust are:
     - The current element `j` being processed in the loop.
     - The modified state of `additional_marks` after processing `j`.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to consider the first element `j` from `additional_marks` that has not been processed yet.
   - After processing this `j`, `additional_marks` might include `i + j` if the conditions are met.

Given the initial conditions and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is still an index less than `n`.
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `marks` remains the same unless a new element is added during the loop execution.
- `need_x` and `need_y` remain `False`.
- `additional_marks` is now the list with the first element `j` processed removed, and possibly including `i + j` if the conditions were met.

However, since we are asked to provide the state right before entering the loop for the next iteration, we assume no changes have been made yet.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list with at least 1 element.**
