`x_found` is reassigned the value `True`, which is already its current value, so there is no change in its state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`.

Output State: **`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `marks_set` is a set containing unique elements from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True`, and `y_found` is `True`.**
