The code appends `i + j` to the list `additional_marks`. The value of `i + j` is known from the precondition and is not in `marks`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in the `marks` list, `n` must be greater than 0, `marks` is a non-empty list, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` contains at least one element plus the new element `i + j`, `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`**
