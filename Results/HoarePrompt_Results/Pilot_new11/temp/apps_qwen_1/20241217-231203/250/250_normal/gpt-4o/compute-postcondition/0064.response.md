Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `marks` is a list with at least one less element than before.
   - `y_found` is `False`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `mark` in the list `marks`.

3. **Loop Body Conditions**:
   - If `mark + x + y` or `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark + y`.
   - If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` or `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the value `mark - x`.
   - If none of these conditions are met, then `marks` has at least one less element and `y_found` remains `False`.

4. **Impact of the Loop**:
   - If any of the conditions in the loop body are met, the value of `new_marks` is updated, but this does not necessarily mean that `marks` will have exactly one less element or `y_found` will change.
   - The loop will continue until it either modifies `new_marks` or the list `marks` has fewer elements.

5. **Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `marks` must still have at least one element (since it starts with at least one less element than before).
   - `y_found` must remain `False` since no condition in the loop body changes it to `True`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`marks` is a list with at least two less elements than before, `y_found` is `False`**.
