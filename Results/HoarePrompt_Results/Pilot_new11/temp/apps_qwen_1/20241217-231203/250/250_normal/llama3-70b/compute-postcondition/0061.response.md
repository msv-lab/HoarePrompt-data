The code initializes an empty list `additional_marks`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `need_x`, `need_y`, or `marks`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is an index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `j >= i` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`; `additional_marks` is an empty list**
