Postcondition: ***`marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y_found` is `True`, and `x_found` is `True`. If `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, the function continues with these conditions. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
