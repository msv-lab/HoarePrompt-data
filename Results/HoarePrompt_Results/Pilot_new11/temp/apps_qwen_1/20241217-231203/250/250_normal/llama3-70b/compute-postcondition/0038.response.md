The line `need_y = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_y`. The value of `need_x` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. The other variables (`i`, `j`, and `marks`) also remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is a valid index less than `n`, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, `j` is `i + 1`**
