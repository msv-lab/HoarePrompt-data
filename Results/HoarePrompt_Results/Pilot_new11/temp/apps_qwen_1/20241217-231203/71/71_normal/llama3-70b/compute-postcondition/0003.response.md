`w` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `k` also remains unchanged. The initial state's conditions about `n` and `k` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that is not divisible by \(10^k\), `k` is an input integer, `w` is 1**
