Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the input number `n` ends with less than `k` trailing zeros. Specifically, consider the following input:

**Input**
```
10203049 2
```

**Expected Output**
```
3
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
```

This is because the program removes digits from the left until the number is divisible by \(10^k\). In this case, it incorrectly removes only one digit (the '1') and leaves '0203049', which is not divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). The correct approach would be to remove three digits ('1', '0', and '2') to make the number '03049', and then remove the leading '0' to get '3049', which is still not divisible by 100. Finally, removing '3', '0', and '4' leaves '9', and adding back the necessary leading zeros gives '0009', which is divisible by 100.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
