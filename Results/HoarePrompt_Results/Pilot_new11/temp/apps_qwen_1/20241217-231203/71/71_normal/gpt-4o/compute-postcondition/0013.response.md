According to the code, the loop iterates over each digit in the string `n` in reverse order. The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how the variables change during each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is an integer.
- `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0 based on whether the digit considered is '0'.
- `to_remove` is 1 if the digit is not '0', otherwise it is 0.

The loop continues until `count_zeros` equals `k`. Once `count_zeros == k`, the condition is true, and no further changes are made to the variables. However, since there is no `else` part, the postcondition remains as the precondition for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `count_zeros` must not yet equal `k`. Therefore, `count_zeros` must be less than `k`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0 based on whether the digit considered is '0', and `to_remove` is 1 if the digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 0. If `count_zeros < k`, the condition is false, and the loop continues.**

So, the final state before the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0 based on whether the digit considered is '0', and `to_remove` is 1 if the digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 0. `count_zeros` must be less than `k` for the loop to continue.**
