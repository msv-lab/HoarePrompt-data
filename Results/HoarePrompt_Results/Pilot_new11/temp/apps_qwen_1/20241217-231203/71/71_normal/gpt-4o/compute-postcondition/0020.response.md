`count_zeros` is incremented by 1, so it now includes one more zero from the string `n`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `to_remove` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros in `n` up to the current position plus 1, `to_remove` is the number of digits not yet processed minus 1**
