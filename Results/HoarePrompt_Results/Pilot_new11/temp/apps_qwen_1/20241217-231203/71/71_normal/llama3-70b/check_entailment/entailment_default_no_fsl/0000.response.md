Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle cases where the number `n` already ends with `10^k` digits or has trailing zeros that can be removed without changing the number of divisions required. Specifically, the code continuously divides `n` by 10 until it becomes divisible by `10^k`, which is not the optimal solution.

For example, consider the input:
```
10203049 2
```
The expected output is `3` because we need to remove three digits (2, 0, and 3) to make the number divisible by 100. However, the current implementation would keep dividing the number by 10, reducing the count of divisions, which is not correct.

To fix this, we need to count the trailing zeros and adjust the count of divisions accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n > 0:
        if n % 10 == 0:
            w += 1
            n //= 10
        else:
            break
    trailing_zeros = 0
    while n % 10 == 0:
        trailing_zeros += 1
        n //= 10
    if trailing_zeros >= k:
        w -= k
    else:
        w += k - trailing_zeros
    print(w)

func()
```

This corrected code counts trailing zeros and adjusts the division count accordingly, ensuring the minimal number of digits are removed to make the number divisible by `10^k`.
