Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0 based on whether the digit considered is '0', and `to_remove` is 1 if the digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 0. If `count_zeros == k`, the condition is true, and no changes are made to the variables. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the precondition.***
