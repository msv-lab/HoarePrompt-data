The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 100\), and a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons. It checks whether it is possible to distribute the balloons such that no more than `k` balloons of the same color are together.

Specifically, the function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `s` from standard input.
2. Counts the occurrences of each color in the string `s` and stores them in a dictionary `color_count`.
3. Checks if the count of any color exceeds `k`. If it does, sets `can_distribute` to `False`.
4. Prints 'YES' if no color count exceeds `k`, otherwise prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where the input string `s` is empty or contains no characters. In such cases, the behavior is undefined based on the current implementation.
- The function does not validate that `n` and `k` are within the specified range (1 to 100). If `n` or `k` are out of this range, the behavior is also undefined.
- The function does not return anything; it only prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console.
