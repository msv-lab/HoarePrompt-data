The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 100\), and a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet representing the colors of the balloons. 

Case_1: `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, and `s` is a string of lowercase letters. The function returns the length of the string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k` (both within the range 1 to 100) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters, and return the length of the string `s`.
