`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. However, the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided in the initial state, and the input is not given here. So, the only information we can state is that `n` and `k` are positive integers as per the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
