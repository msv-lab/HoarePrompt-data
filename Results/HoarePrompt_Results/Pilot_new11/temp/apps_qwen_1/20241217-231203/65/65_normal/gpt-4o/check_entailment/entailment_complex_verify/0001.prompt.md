You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it's possible to distribute the balloons among Kefa's friends such that no friend gets more than one balloon of the same color. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of balloons (`n`) and friends (`k`), followed by the string of balloon colors (`s`).
2. It uses a dictionary `color_count` to count the occurrences of each color.
3. It iterates through the counts of each color and checks if any color count exceeds the number of friends (`k`). If so, it sets `can_distribute` to `False`.
4. Finally, it prints `YES` if all colors can be distributed without any friend getting more than one of the same color, otherwise it prints `NO`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. It ensures that the distribution of balloons adheres to the requirement that no friend gets more than one balloon of the same color. There are no edge cases or inputs that this program would fail to handle as per the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100, and s is a string consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and its corresponding value is the count of that character in `s`.
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `can_distribute` is `False`
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`can_distribute` remains `False`. If `can_distribute` is `True`, the state does not change. Otherwise, `can_distribute` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 100\), and a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons. It checks whether it is possible to distribute the balloons such that no more than `k` balloons of the same color are together.

Specifically, the function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `s` from standard input.
2. Counts the occurrences of each color in the string `s` and stores them in a dictionary `color_count`.
3. Checks if the count of any color exceeds `k`. If it does, sets `can_distribute` to `False`.
4. Prints 'YES' if no color count exceeds `k`, otherwise prints 'NO'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where the input string `s` is empty or contains no characters. In such cases, the behavior is undefined based on the current implementation.
- The function does not validate that `n` and `k` are within the specified range (1 to 100). If `n` or `k` are out of this range, the behavior is also undefined.
- The function does not return anything; it only prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
