Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the inputs `n` and `k` as integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads the string `s` which represents the colors of the balloons.

2. **Counting Balloon Colors:**
   - A dictionary `color_count` is used to count the occurrences of each color in the string `s`.
   - The program iterates over each character in `s` and updates the count of each color in `color_count`.

3. **Distributing Balloons:**
   - After counting the colors, the program checks if the number of any color exceeds the number of friends `k`.
   - If the count of any color is greater than `k`, the variable `can_distribute` is set to `False`.
   - This ensures that if any color appears more times than there are friends, the distribution is not possible.

4. **Output:**
   - If `can_distribute` is still `True` after the loop, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Why it Always Follows the Problem Description:

- The program correctly handles the constraints \(1 \leq n, k \leq 100\) and processes strings consisting of lowercase letters.
- It ensures that no friend receives more than one balloon of the same color, as it checks if the count of any color exceeds the number of friends.
- The output is "YES" if the distribution is possible, and "NO" otherwise, matching the exact requirements specified in the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
