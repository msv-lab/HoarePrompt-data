Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least one character, and `color_count` is a dictionary. If `color` is already a key in `color_count`, its value is incremented by 1. If `color` is not a key in `color_count`, it is added as a key with a value of 1.***
