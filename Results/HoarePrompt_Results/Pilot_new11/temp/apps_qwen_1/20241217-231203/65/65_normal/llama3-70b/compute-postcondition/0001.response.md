`s` is reassigned the value of `input()`, which means `s` will now hold the string input by the user, while `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string read from input; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input.

Output State: **`s` is a string read from input; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input**
