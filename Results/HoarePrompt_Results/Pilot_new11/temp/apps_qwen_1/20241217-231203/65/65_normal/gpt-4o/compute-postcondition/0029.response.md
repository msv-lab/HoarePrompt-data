`can_distribute` is explicitly set to `False`. The value of `count` and the condition that it is an integer greater than `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer greater than `k`, and `can_distribute` is `False`.

Output State: **`count` is an integer greater than `k`, and `can_distribute` is `False`**
