The code `v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `v1` and `v2`. This affects `v1` and `v2` but does not provide specific values since they depend on user input. The initial conditions for `t` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers (1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100) and equal to the integers entered by the user; `t` is an integer (2 ≤ t ≤ 100); `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ 10)**
