You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment. Specifically, the program attempts to fill in the speeds array in a way that does not always respect the constraint that the absolute value of the difference between speeds of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed \(d\).

For instance, consider the following input:
```
1 3
4 2
```

- According to the problem description, the speeds should change by at most 2 meters per second between any two adjacent seconds.
- A valid sequence of speeds could be: 1, 3, 3, 3.
- This sequence respects the constraints: the initial speed is 1, the final speed is 3, and the speed change between any two adjacent seconds is at most 2.
- The total distance covered would be \(1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10\) meters.

However, the program calculates the speeds as follows:
```
speeds = [1, 3, 3, 3]
```
And sums them up to give a total distance of 10 meters.

But the program actually calculates the speeds as:
```
speeds = [1, 3, 2, 3]
```
Which does not respect the constraint that the absolute value of the difference between speeds of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed 2. The correct calculation should ensure that the sequence of speeds respects the given constraints, but the provided program does not do this properly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this and other similar cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100, t is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, and d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the second integer input, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `a` and the last element is `b`, and each element `speeds[i]` for `1 ≤ i < t` is calculated as `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two initial speeds `v_1` and `v_2` (integers within the range [1, 100]), a time duration `t` (an integer within the range [2, 100]), and a speed increment `d` (an integer within the range [0, 10]). It then calculates a list of speeds for each time step from 0 to `t-1`, ensuring that the speeds do not exceed `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. The first speed in the list is set to `v_1`, and the last speed is set to `v_2`. After calculating the speeds, it computes the total distance traveled based on these speeds and prints the result. Potential edge cases include the minimum speed not being updated correctly if `d` is 0, and the maximum speed exceeding `v_2` if `d` is large enough.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
