The initial state provides specific ranges for several variables:
- `v1` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100
- `t` is at least 2
- `d` is an integer between 0 and 10
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t + min_speed`
- `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` twice
- `i` is 2

The code snippet is:
```python
min_length += min_speed
```

Step-by-step analysis:
- `min_length` was initially defined as `min_speed * t + min_speed`.
- The code increments `min_length` by `min_speed`.

So, the new value of `min_length` becomes:
\[ \text{min\_length} = (\text{min\_speed} \times t + \text{min\_speed}) + \text{min\_speed} = \text{min\_speed} \times t + 2 \times \text{min\_speed} \]

Other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer between 1 and 100; `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is at least 2; `d` is an integer between 0 and 10; `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t + 2 * min_speed`; `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` twice; `i` is 2**
