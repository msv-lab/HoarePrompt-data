The code updates `max_speed` to be the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`. We know that `min_speed` is defined as `min_speed + d` and `max_speed` is defined as `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.

Given these definitions, we can substitute the expressions into the updated `max_speed` formula:

- Initially, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

So, when updating `max_speed`, we need to consider both the initial definition and the relationship between `min_speed` and `max_speed`.

Since `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, and `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, the updated `max_speed` will be the maximum of `max_speed - d` and the current `min_speed`.

The output state is:

**`v1` is an integer between 1 and 100, `v2` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is at least 2, `d` is an integer between 0 and 10, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t + 2 * min_speed`, `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed` twice, `i` is 2**
