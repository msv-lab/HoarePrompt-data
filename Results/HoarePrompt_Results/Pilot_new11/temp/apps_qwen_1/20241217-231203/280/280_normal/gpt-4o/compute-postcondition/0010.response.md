The code updates the value of `speeds[i]` where `i` is 3. Let's break down the steps:

1. From the initial state, `i` is 3.
2. The formula to update `speeds[i]` is given by `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.
3. Since `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2. So, `speeds[i - 1]` is `speeds[2]`.
4. `speeds[2]` is `min(min(a + d, b + (t - 2) * d) + d, b + (t - 3) * d)`.
5. Substituting `speeds[2]` into the formula, we get:
   \[
   speeds[3] = \min(\text{speeds}[2] + d, v2 + (t - 3 - 1) * d)
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   speeds[3] = \min(\text{speeds}[2] + d, v2 + (t - 4) * d)
   \]
6. The values of `v2` and `d` remain unchanged, and `t` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` must be greater than 2, `d` is the second integer input, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `a`, the second element is `min(a + d, b + (t - 2) * d)`, the third element is `min(min(a + d, b + (t - 2) * d) + d, b + (t - 3) * d)`, and `speeds[3]` is `min(speeds[2] + d, v2 + (t - 4) * d)`**, and `i` is 3.
