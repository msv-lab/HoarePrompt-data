The code `print(total_distance)` does not change any variables. It simply prints the value of `total_distance`. Since `total_distance` was defined as the sum of the elements in `speeds`, and no operations are performed on `total_distance` within the given code snippet, the value of `total_distance` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total_distance` is the sum of the elements in `speeds`, `v1` is a, `v2` is b, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the second integer input, and `speeds` is a list of length t where the first element is a and the last element is b, and each element speeds[i] for 1 â‰¤ i < t is calculated as min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d).**
