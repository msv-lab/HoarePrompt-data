Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `v1` is `a`
   - `v2` is `b`
   - `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1
   - `d` is the second integer input
   - `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `a` and the last element is `b`, and each element `speeds[i]` for `1 ≤ i < t` is calculated as `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `total_distance = sum(speeds)` calculates the sum of all elements in the `speeds` list and assigns it to `total_distance`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `total_distance` is assigned the sum of all elements in `speeds`.
   - The other variables (`v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `speeds`) remain unchanged.

4. **Calculation of `speeds`:**
   - The first element of `speeds` is `a`.
   - The last element of `speeds` is `b`.
   - For each element `speeds[i]` where `1 ≤ i < t`, the value is calculated as `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.

Since the calculation of `speeds` is based on the initial conditions and the structure of the list, we can express the final state of `speeds` in terms of `a`, `b`, `d`, and `t`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

- `total_distance` is the sum of the elements in `speeds`.
- `v1` is `a`
- `v2` is `b`
- `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1
- `d` is the second integer input
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `a` and the last element is `b`, and each element `speeds[i]` for `1 ≤ i < t` is calculated as `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`.

Output State: **`total_distance` is the sum of the elements in speeds, `v1` is a, `v2` is b, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the second integer input, and `speeds` is a list of length t where the first element is a and the last element is b, and each element speeds[i] for 1 ≤ i < t is calculated as min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d).**
