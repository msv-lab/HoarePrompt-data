Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has an issue with updating the speeds correctly, especially when `d` is 0. The code attempts to ensure that the speeds do not exceed `v_2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, but it does not properly handle the case where `d` is 0. When `d` is 0, the speed should remain constant between `v_1` and `v_2`, but the current implementation may not enforce this correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 6
4 0
```

According to the problem description, the speeds should be `5, 5, 5, 6` to maximize the distance. However, the current implementation might incorrectly set all speeds to `6`, leading to a total distance of `6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24` instead of the correct `26`.

To fix this, the code should ensure that the speed remains constant when `d` is 0. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        if d == 0:
            speeds[i] = v2
        else:
            speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)

func()
```

With this correction, the code should handle all cases correctly.
