Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `v1` is `a`
- `v2` is `b`
- `t` is the first integer input
- `d` is the second integer input
- `speeds` is a list of `t` elements where:
  - The first element is `a`
  - The last element is `v2`

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(1, t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < t`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `v1` (which is `a`)
   - `v2` (which is `b`)
   - `t` (first integer input)
   - `d` (second integer input)
   - `speeds` (list of `t` elements starting with `a` and ending with `b`)

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.
   - The condition `i < t` must hold true for the loop to execute. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `i` is 1
- `t` must be greater than 1

### Conclusion:
State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` must be greater than 1, `d` is the second integer input, `speeds` is a list of `t` elements where the first element is `a` and the last element is `v2`, `i` is 1**

This ensures that the loop will start executing correctly with `i` initialized to 1 and `t` being a positive integer greater than 1.
