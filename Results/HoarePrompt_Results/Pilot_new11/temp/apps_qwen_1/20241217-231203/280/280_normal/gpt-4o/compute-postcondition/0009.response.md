Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `v1` is `a`
   - `v2` is `b`
   - `t` must be greater than 2
   - `d` is the second integer input
   - `speeds` is a list where:
     - The first element is `a`
     - The second element is `min(a + d, b + (t - 2) * d)`
     - The third element is `min(min(a + d, b + (t - 2) * d) + d, b + (t - 3) * d)`
   - `i` is 2

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(1, t)`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 3.
   - Since `i` starts from 1, the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `t`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be incremented from 2 to 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < t`, so `t` must still be greater than 2.
   - `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.
   - `d` remains unchanged.
   - `speeds` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

- `i` will be 3.
- `t` must still be greater than 2.

The final state is:

State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` must be greater than 2, `d` is the second integer input, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `a`, the second element is `min(a + d, b + (t - 2) * d)`, and the third element is `min(min(a + d, b + (t - 2) * d) + d, b + (t - 3) * d)`, and `i` is 3**
