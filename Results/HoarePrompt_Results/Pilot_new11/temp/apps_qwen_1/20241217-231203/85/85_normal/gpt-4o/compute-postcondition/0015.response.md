Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) from the user where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It then counts the number of trailing 9s in \( n \), removes those trailing 9s, and calculates a value based on the remaining part of \( n \) and the count of trailing 9s. Specifically, it computes \( (n + 1) \times \text{count of trailing 9s} \) and prints the result. If \( n \) does not have any trailing 9s, the count will be 0, and the result will be \( n + 1 \).**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( n \) ends with one or more trailing 9s, the function correctly counts these 9s and removes them, then calculates and prints the required value.
- If \( n \) does not end with any 9s, the function still works correctly, setting the count of trailing 9s to 0 and printing \( n + 1 \).
- The function handles the upper limit of \( 10^9 \) correctly, ensuring that even very large numbers are processed accurately. However, extremely large inputs might still face issues due to integer overflow limitations in Python.
