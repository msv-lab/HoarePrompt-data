The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 2, so after the operation, `ans` becomes 3. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^9\), `ans` is 3, and `i` is 3.**
