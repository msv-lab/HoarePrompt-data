The code calculates `pairs` as `(n + 1) * max_9s`. Given the initial state where `n` is an integer value with all trailing 9s removed, and `max_9s` is the count of trailing 9s removed from the original value of `n`, the value of `n` remains unchanged, but `pairs` is computed.

- `n` does not change.
- `max_9s` does not change.
- `pairs` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) * max_9s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the count of trailing 9s that were removed from the original value of `n`, and `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the count of trailing 9s that were removed from the original value of `n`, and `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`.**
