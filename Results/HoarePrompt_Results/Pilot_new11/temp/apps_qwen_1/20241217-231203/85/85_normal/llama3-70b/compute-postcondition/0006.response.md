According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^9\)
- `ans` is 1
- `i` is 1

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The loop condition is `range(1, n // 2 + 1)`.
- This means the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n // 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and become 2. Therefore, `i` should be set to 2.

Since `i` is 2, the next value to check in the range is `n // 2 + 1`. However, the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n // 2 + 1`. Since `i` is now 2, the only way for the loop to continue is if `n // 2 + 1` is greater than 2. Given the constraints on `n` (it must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^9\)), this condition is always satisfied because even the smallest possible value of `n` (which is 2) would make `n // 2 + 1` equal to 2, but since `i` is incremented, the next possible value of `i` would still be within the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^9\)
- `ans` remains 1
- `i` is 2

State: **`n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^9\), `ans` is 1, and `i` is 2**
