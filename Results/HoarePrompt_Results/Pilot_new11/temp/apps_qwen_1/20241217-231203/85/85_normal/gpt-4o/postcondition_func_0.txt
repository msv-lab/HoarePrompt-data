The function reads an integer \( n \) from the user where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It then counts the number of trailing 9s in \( n \), removes those trailing 9s, and calculates a value based on the remaining part of \( n \) and the count of trailing 9s. Specifically, it computes \( (n + 1) \times \text{count of trailing 9s} \) and prints the result. If \( n \) does not have any trailing 9s, the count will be 0, and the result will be \( n + 1 \).
