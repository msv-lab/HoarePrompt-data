According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This condition checks if adding 1 to `n` results in a number that ends in 0, meaning `n` must end in 9 for the condition to be true.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a number that does not end in 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must end in 9 after incrementing it by 1. Therefore, `n` must have been 8 in the previous iteration to satisfy the condition and cause the loop to continue.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop continues as long as `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`.
2. For the loop to continue, `n + 1` must end in 0, meaning `n` must end in 9.
3. Given that `n` does not end in 8 at the end of the previous iteration, it must have ended in 9 to satisfy the condition and cause the loop to continue.

Thus, we need to adjust the state so that `n` ends in 9.

State: **`n` must end in 9, `max_9s` is 2**
