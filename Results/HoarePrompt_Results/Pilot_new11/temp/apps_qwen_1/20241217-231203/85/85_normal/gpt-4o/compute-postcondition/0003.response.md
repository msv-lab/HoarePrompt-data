`max_9s` is incremented by 1. The original value of `max_9s` is 0, so it becomes 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be an integer ending in 9, `max_9s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` must be an integer ending in 9, `max_9s` is 1**
