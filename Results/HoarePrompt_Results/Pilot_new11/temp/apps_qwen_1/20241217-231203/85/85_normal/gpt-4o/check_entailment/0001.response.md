Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The logic in the program to determine `max_9s` is flawed. It only checks if `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, which is incorrect for determining the maximum number of trailing nines.

For example, consider `n = 99`. The correct output should be 1, because the only pair that ends with the maximum number of nines (two nines) is (49, 50). However, the program incorrectly calculates `max_9s` and `pairs`.

To fix this, we need to find the highest power of 10 that divides `(n + 1) / 10` and subtract it from 1 to get the number of trailing nines. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    temp_n = n + 1
    while temp_n % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        temp_n //= 10
    
    pairs = (n - 10**(max_9s-1) + 1) * max_9s // 2
    print(pairs)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the number of pairs with the maximum number of trailing nines.
