According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. This condition checks if adding 1 to `n` results in a number that ends in 0. For the loop to execute again, this condition must be true.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer that does not end in 9, and `max_9s` is 1. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that adding 1 to `n` results in a number that ends in 0.

Given that `n` does not end in 9, the next possible number that could satisfy the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` would be when `n` ends in 8 (since 8 + 1 = 9, and 9 % 10 = 9, but we need 0). Therefore, `n` must end in 8 for the loop to execute again.

So, we need to adjust the state such that `n` ends in 8. The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the condition of the loop.

State: **`n` must end in 8, `max_9s` is 1**
