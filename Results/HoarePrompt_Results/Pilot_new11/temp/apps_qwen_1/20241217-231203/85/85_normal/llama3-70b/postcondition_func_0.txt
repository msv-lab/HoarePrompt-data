The function reads an integer \( n \) from the user where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It then iterates through the range from 1 to \( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \) (inclusive) and counts the number of integers \( i \) in this range for which the sum \( i + (n - i) \) is divisible by \( 10 \) raised to the power of one less than the length of the string representation of \( i + (n - i) \). Finally, it prints the count of such integers. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly mentioned in the annotations; however, it implicitly handles the case where \( n \) is even or odd. If \( n \) is even, \( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \) will be an integer, and if \( n \) is odd, \( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \) will be a half-integer rounded up.
