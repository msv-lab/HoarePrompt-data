The code `print(0)` does not affect the values of `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`. It only prints `0` to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cnt1` is the first input integer, `cnt2` is the second input integer, `cnt3` is the third input integer, `cnt4` is the fourth input integer, and 0 is printed to the console.**
