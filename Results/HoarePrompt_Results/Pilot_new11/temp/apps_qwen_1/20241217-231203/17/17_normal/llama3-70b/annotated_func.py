#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of four lines, each containing one integer \(cnt_i\) where \(0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9\). The values of \(cnt_1\), \(cnt_2\), \(cnt_3\), and \(cnt_4\) represent the counts of strings "(()", "()", ")(", and "))" respectively.
def func():
    cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4 = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if (cnt3 > cnt1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4` are integers. If `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, then 0 is printed to the console. Otherwise, if `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`, then 1 is printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer values `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt3`, and `cnt4`, representing the counts of the string patterns "(()", "()", ")(", and "))" respectively. It then compares `cnt3` and `cnt1`. If `cnt3` is greater than `cnt1`, it prints `0`; otherwise, it prints `1`. There are no return values, and the function does not modify any input parameters or introduce new variables. The final state of the program is that either `0` or `1` is printed to the console, depending on the comparison result. Potential edge cases include when `cnt3` is exactly equal to `cnt1`, in which case `1` is printed. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; however, it assumes valid input (i.e., non-negative integers within the specified range).
