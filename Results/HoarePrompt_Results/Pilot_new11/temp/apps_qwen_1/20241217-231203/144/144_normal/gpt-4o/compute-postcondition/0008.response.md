Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `mex` is 2.
   - If the current value of `num` (an element in `a`) is greater than or equal to 1, then `mex` remains 2.

2. **For Loop Statement**: The for loop iterates over each `num` in the list `a`.

3. **Loop Execution**: During each iteration, `num` takes the value of one of the elements from the list `a`.

4. **State Adjustment**: To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues. Since the loop iterates over all elements in `a`, the only state that changes is the value of `num` as it moves to the next element in the list. The variable `mex` remains unchanged as long as `num` is greater than or equal to 1, according to the condition provided.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to take the value of the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `n` is an integer.
- `mex` is still 2, because the condition for changing `mex` is not met yet (the current `num` is greater than or equal to 1).

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is an integer, `mex` is 2**.
