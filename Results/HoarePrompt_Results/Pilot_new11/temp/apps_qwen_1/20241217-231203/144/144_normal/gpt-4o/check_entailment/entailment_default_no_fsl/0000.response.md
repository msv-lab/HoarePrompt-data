Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the code fails to handle cases where the array contains duplicate values that prevent the mex from being maximized. 

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
5
1 1 1 1 6
```
- Expected Output:
```
3
```
- Actual Output:
```
2
```

The code sorts the array and increments `mex` as long as `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`. However, if the array contains multiple elements that are the same and less than or equal to `mex`, it will incorrectly increment `mex` without considering the possibility of skipping over a smaller value. To fix this, the code needs to ensure that it skips over all elements in the array that are less than or equal to `mex` before incrementing `mex`.

A corrected version of the code could be:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = 1
    for num in a:
        if num < mex:
            continue
        elif num == mex:
            mex += 1
        else:
            break
    print(mex)
```

This corrected version ensures that `mex` is incremented only when necessary and skips over duplicates that are less than or equal to `mex`, allowing it to find the correct maximum mex value.
