The code prints the value of `mex`. Since `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`, printing `mex` does not change its value or affect any other variables. The output of the program is simply the value of `mex`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`; `mex` is printed.**
