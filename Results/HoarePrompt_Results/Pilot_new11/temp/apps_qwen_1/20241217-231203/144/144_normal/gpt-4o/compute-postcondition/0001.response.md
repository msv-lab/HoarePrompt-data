The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers, which is assigned to the variable `a`. The initial state includes the existence of the list `a` containing the integers from the input, and the variable `n` which was previously read from the input.

After executing the code, the value of `a` will be updated to the list of integers read from the input, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is an integer read from the input**
