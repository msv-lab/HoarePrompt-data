The `mex` variable is incremented by 1. Initially, `mex` is either 1 or 2. Incrementing 1 results in 2, and incrementing 2 results in 3. Therefore, the value of `mex` after executing the code is either 2 or 3.

The states of the other variables (`n` and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, and `mex` is either 2 or 3.**
