The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables and is typically used to exit a loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, and `mex` is either 1 or 2.**
