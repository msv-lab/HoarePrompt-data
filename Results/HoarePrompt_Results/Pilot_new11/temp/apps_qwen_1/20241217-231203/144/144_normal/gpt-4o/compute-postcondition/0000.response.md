The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length and content of the list mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged, but the variable `n` now holds the value read from the input.

Output State: **The input is a list of integers representing the array elements, where the length of the list is between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), and each element is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive); `n` is an integer read from the input.**
