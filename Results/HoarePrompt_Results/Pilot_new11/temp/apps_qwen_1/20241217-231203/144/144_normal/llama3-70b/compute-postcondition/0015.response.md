Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, and `mex` is either 1 or 2. If `num` (which is presumably `n`) is greater than `mex`, then the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged from the precondition.***
