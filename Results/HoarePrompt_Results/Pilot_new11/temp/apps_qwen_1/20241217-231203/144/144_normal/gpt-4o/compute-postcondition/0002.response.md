The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in the list `a`, we will keep it as a general list of integers. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers (initial list of integers read from the input), `n` is an integer read from the input**
