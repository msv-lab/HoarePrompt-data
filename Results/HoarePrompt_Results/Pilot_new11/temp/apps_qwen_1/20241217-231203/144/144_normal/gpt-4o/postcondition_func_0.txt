The function `func` accepts a list of integers and sorts the list in ascending order. It then determines the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sorted list. The function prints this integer, which represents the minimum excluded number (Mex) of the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include empty lists, lists with duplicate numbers, and lists with consecutive numbers starting from 1.
