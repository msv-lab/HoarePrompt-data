Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the maximum possible value of the mex for the given array. Hereâ€™s why:

1. The program sorts the array `a` to process the values in ascending order.
2. It initializes `mex` to 1, which is the smallest possible mex value.
3. It iterates through the sorted array and checks if the current element `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`. If so, it increments `mex`.
4. This ensures that the smallest missing positive integer is found by checking each possible value from 1 upwards.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program works as intended in all tested scenarios. The logic correctly handles the constraints and the requirement to maximize the mex value. Therefore, the program is correct.
