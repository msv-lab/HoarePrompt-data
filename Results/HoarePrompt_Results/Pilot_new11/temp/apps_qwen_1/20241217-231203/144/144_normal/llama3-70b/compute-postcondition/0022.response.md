Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `mex` is initially set to 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each `num` in `arr`.
   - If `num` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is incremented by 1.
   - If `num` is greater than `mex`, the loop breaks.

3. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The loop will continue until it finds a `num` that is greater than `mex`.
   - If all numbers in `arr` are less than or equal to `mex`, the loop will update `mex` until it finds the smallest missing non-negative integer.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `arr`.
   - This is because the loop increments `mex` only when it encounters a match, ensuring that the next integer (if not found) is the `mex`.

### Conclusion:
- The final value of `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`.
- `n` and `arr` retain their original values unless modified within the loop, but since no modifications are made to `n` and `arr` within the loop, they remain as originally provided.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr`.
