The function reads two inputs from standard input: an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then sorts the array and calculates the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. The function outputs this integer to standard output. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when the array contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, or when the array is empty. In such cases, the function correctly outputs `n` and `0` respectively.
