Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `white_pixels` is not an empty list.
- `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.
- `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is at least 1.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`. For each `j`, the loop checks the conditions and updates the `pixels` array based on those conditions.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Border Pixels:** If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, the pixel is set to `'+'`.
2. **White Pixels:** If `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, the loop continues without changing anything.
3. **Default Value:** If none of the above conditions are met, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.

### After All Iterations:
- Since `i` starts at 0 and `j` iterates from 0 to `m-1`, the loop will run for `m` iterations for each `i`.
- After the loop completes, the entire row `i` from `min_x` to `max_x` and columns `min_y` to `max_y` will be processed according to the rules defined.

#### Final State:
- `white_pixels`: This list will still be non-empty because the loop does not modify the `white_pixels` list directly.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`: These values will not change because they are determined based on the initial coordinates of `'w'` pixels and do not get updated during the loop.
- `frame_size`: This value will also remain the same because it is derived from `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` and does not change during the loop.
- `i`: After the loop completes, `i` will be incremented to the next row, but since we are only interested in the state after the loop, `i` will be the last row processed.
- `n` and `m`: These values remain the same because the loop does not modify them.
- `pixels`: The pixels within the bounding box `[min_x, max_x] x [min_y, max_y]` will be modified according to the loop conditions.

### Output State:
- `white_pixels` is a non-empty list.
- `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.
- `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.
- `i` is the last row processed (initially 0).
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is at least 1.
- `pixels` is updated such that:
  - For all positions `(i, j)` within the bounds of the frame:
    - If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'`.
    - Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, the pixel remains unchanged.
    - Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.

**Output State:**
**`white_pixels` is a non-empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the last row processed (initially 0), `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, and for all positions `(i, j)` within the bounds of the frame:
- If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'`.
- Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, the pixel remains unchanged; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.**
