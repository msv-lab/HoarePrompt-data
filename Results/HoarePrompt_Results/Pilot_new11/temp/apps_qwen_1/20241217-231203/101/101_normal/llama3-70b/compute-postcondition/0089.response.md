Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is at least the maximum value among the conditions met during the loop iterations, `pixels[i][j]` is either '+', 'w', or '.' depending on the conditions.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each column `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
- If the conditions `i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'` are met, the pixel at `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'.`
- If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- For any other condition, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.

After all iterations, `i` remains `n - 1` because the loop only increments `j`. The value of `m` is incremented each time the condition `pixels[i][j] == '.'` and `i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y` is met. The final value of `m` will be the count of such conditions.

The value of `pixels[i][j]` will be either `'+', 'w',` or `'. '` based on the conditions evaluated during the loop.
