Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initially, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `None`. This means that no 'w' pixels have been encountered yet.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over every element in the `screen` 2D list.
   - For each element `screen[i][j]` that is `'w'`:
     - If `top` is `None`, it sets `top` and `bottom` to `i` and `left` and `right` to `j`.
     - If `top` is not `None`, it updates `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to reflect the smallest and largest indices of 'w' pixels found so far.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, if there was at least one 'w' pixel in the `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will hold the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' pixels, respectively.
   - If there were no 'w' pixels in the `screen`, `top` and `bottom` will still be `None` (since they were never set), and `left` and `right` will be `None` (since they were set to `j` only when `top` was `None`, and `j` is the last column index, which would be `m-1`).

Thus, the final state after the loop executes is that `top` and `bottom` are the minimum and maximum row indices of 'w' pixels, and `left` and `right` are the minimum and maximum column indices of 'w' pixels. If no 'w' pixels are present, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` will remain `None`.
