Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `screen` is a 2D list of characters.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `m-1`.
- `top` is either `None` or has an initial value (let's assume it's not relevant for this iteration since `j` is already `m-1`).
- `bottom` retains its original value, which is `n-1`.
- `left` and `right` are both `m-1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.

### Current State:
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `m-1`.

### What Happens in the Next Iteration:
- The loop will increment `j` from `m-1` to `m`.

Since `j` is currently `m-1`, the next iteration will attempt to increment `j` to `m`, which is out of bounds for the loop condition `range(m)`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since `j` is out of bounds, the loop does not execute again.
- Therefore, no changes are needed to the states because the loop does not continue.

### Final State:
- `screen` remains the same 2D list of characters.
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `j` remains `m-1`.
- `top` retains its original value.
- `bottom` remains `n-1`.
- `left` and `right` remain `m-1`.

### Answer:
State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` and `right` are both `m-1`**.
