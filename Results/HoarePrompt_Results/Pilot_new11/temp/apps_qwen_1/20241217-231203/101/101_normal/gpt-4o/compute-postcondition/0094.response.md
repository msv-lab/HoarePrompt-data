Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`. If `top` is `None`, then `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `right` retains its original value from the precondition, `left` is `m-1`, and `right` is `m-1`. Otherwise, if `j > right`, then `right` is set to `m-1`; otherwise, `right` retains its original value. Both `top` and `left` retain their original values from the precondition.***
