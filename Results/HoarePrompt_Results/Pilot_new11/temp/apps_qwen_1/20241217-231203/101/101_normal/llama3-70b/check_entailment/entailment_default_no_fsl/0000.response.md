Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly identify the smallest possible frame for all cases. Specifically, the code calculates the bounding box of the white pixels and assumes that this bounding box represents the smallest possible frame. However, this approach can lead to incorrect results, particularly when the white pixels are not aligned in a way that forms a tight bounding box.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 6
......
.w....
.w....
.w....
......
```

The code will calculate the bounding box as `(1, 1)` to `(2, 4)`, resulting in a frame size of `d = 2`. However, the correct smallest frame would be `d = 1` as shown below:
```
......
+w+...
+w+...
+w+...
......
```

The code fails to check for smaller possible frames when the white pixels are not tightly packed. To fix this, the code needs to iterate over all possible frame sizes starting from the smallest and verify if the frame fits the criteria. Here is a revised version of the code that addresses this issue:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    
    # Check for no white pixels
    if not white_pixels:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    min_x, min_y = min(white_pixels)[::-1]
    max_x, max_y = max(white_pixels)[::-1]

    for d in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
        if (max_x - min_x < d - 1) or (max_y - min_y < d - 1):
            continue
        
        valid = True
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        
        if valid:
            for i in range(n):
                print(''.join(pixels[i]))
            return
    
    print(-1)


func()
```

This revised code iterates over all possible frame sizes and checks if the frame fits the criteria, ensuring the smallest possible frame is found.
