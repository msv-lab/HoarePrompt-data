The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from the standard input stream, which consists of a line containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000), followed by `n` lines of exactly `m` characters each. Each character is either a period (ASCII code 46) representing a black pixel or the lowercase letter 'w' representing a white pixel. At least one 'w' is guaranteed to be present in the input.

After processing this input, the function returns the total count of 'w' characters found in the input.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read a grid of pixels represented by periods and 'w's, and return the count of 'w' characters in the grid.

Functionality: **The function reads a grid of pixels consisting of n lines of m characters each, where each character is either a period or 'w', and returns the count of 'w' characters in the grid.**
