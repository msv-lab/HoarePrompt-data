`left` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is `m-1`. The conditions for setting `bottom` are not met because `i` is `n-1` and it is not greater than `bottom`, which means `bottom` retains its original value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `bottom` retains its original value.**
