The code `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `right`. Since `j` is `m-1`, `right` is also `m-1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`.**
