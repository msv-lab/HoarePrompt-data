The code calculates the `frame_size` using the formula `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. This means `frame_size` will be the maximum difference between the largest and smallest `x` coordinates or the largest and smallest `y` coordinates, plus 1. The values of `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged.

Let's denote the difference between the largest and smallest `x` coordinates as `delta_x = max_x - min_x` and the difference between the largest and smallest `y` coordinates as `delta_y = max_y - min_y`.

The value of `frame_size` will be `max(delta_x, delta_y) + 1`.

Since the exact values of `max_x`, `min_x`, `max_y`, and `min_y` are not provided, we express `frame_size` in terms of these differences:

Output State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.**
