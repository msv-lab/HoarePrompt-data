The code creates a list `white_pixels` containing tuples `(i, j)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1` and `j` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, and the condition is that `pixels[i][j]` equals `'w'`. This means that `white_pixels` will store the coordinates of all `'w'` pixels in the `pixels` grid.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `m` is the second integer input
- The input buffer contains `n` lines of `m` characters each
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains `m` characters

After executing the code, the only variable affected is `white_pixels`, which now contains the coordinates of all `'w'` pixels in the `pixels` grid. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, the input buffer contains n lines of m characters each, `pixels` is a list of n lists, where each sublist contains m characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of all `'w'` pixels in the `pixels` grid.**
