Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `left` is `m-2`, `right` is `m-2`, `top` is `n-1`. If `j > right`, the condition is met and no further changes are made to the variables, ensuring they retain their original values as specified in the precondition.***
