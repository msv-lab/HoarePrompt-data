The code `left = j` updates the value of `left` to be the same as `j`. 

Given the initial state:
- `screen` is a 2D list of characters
- `i` is the same (unchanged)
- `j` is `j+1`
- `top` is `i` if `i < top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged
- `bottom` is now `i`
- `left` is the same if `screen[i][j+1]` is 'w' and `j+1 > right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged
- `right` is the same if `screen[i][j+1]` is 'w' and `j+1 > right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged

After executing `left = j`:
- `left` is updated to `j`
- `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, `right` remain in their respective states from the initial state

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is the same, `j` is `j+1`, `top` is `i` if `i < top`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged, `bottom` is now `i`, `left` is `j`, and `right` is the same if `screen[i][j+1]` is 'w' and `j+1 > right`, otherwise `right` remains unchanged.**
