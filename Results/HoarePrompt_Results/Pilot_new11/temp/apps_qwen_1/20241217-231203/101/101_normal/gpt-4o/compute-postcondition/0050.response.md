To ensure the loop can execute, we need to analyze the given code and the provided initial states. The loop is iterating over `j` from `0` to `m-1`. For this loop to execute, the variable `j` should be within the valid range.

Given the initial states:
- `screen` is a 2D list of characters.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `m-1`.
- `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel.
- `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel.
- `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel.
- `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel.

The key point here is to ensure that `j` (which starts at `m-1`) is less than `m` for the loop to execute at least once. Since `j` starts at `m-1`, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute at least once.
- The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` do not directly affect the loop condition but may be relevant for the loop body operations.
- The value of `i` (`n-1`) and the specific positions of 'w' pixels (defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) do not directly affect the loop condition either.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `j` must be less than `m`.

Final State:
**`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, **`m` must be greater than 0**.
