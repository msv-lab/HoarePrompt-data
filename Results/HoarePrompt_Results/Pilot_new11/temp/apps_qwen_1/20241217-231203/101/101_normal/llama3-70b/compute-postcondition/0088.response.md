Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `pixels[i][j]` is '.', `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `pixels[i][j]` is set to '+'. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', no changes are made. Otherwise, `pixels[n-1][2]` is set to '.'.***
