The code calculates the `frame_width` as `right - left + 1`. The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `frame_height` remain unchanged. Therefore, the `frame_width` is updated based on the existing values of `right` and `left`.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1**.
