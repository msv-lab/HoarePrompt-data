According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pixels`. The loop iterates over each row in the `pixels` list. At the end of the last iteration, `pixels` must be a non-empty list (at least one row), `i` is equal to `n`, and `m` remains the same. Since `i` is equal to `n`, it means that the loop has processed all rows in the `pixels` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one additional row in the `pixels` list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`pixels` must be a non-empty list with at least two rows, and `i` is 0, `m` is the same as before, `pixels[i][j]` for all `i` and `j` is either `'+', 'w',` or `'. '`**, and a new row from the `pixels` list is printed.
