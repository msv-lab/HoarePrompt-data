The code snippet `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `+` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `[i][j]`. The initial state specifies that `j` is 1, but the value of `i` is not specified. The value of `j` remains 1, and the value of `pixels[i][j]` is now `+`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `pixels[i][j]` is '+'**
