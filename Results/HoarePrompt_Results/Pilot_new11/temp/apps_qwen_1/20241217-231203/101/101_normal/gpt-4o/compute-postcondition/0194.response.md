Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `result` is a 2D list with boundary elements marked with `+`.
   - `i` is `bottom + 1`.
   - `j` is `left`.
   - `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
   - If `i` is `top`, `bottom`, `j` is `left`, or `j` is `right`, then `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(left, right + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `left` to `right` inclusive.
   - For each value of `j` within this range, the loop body will be executed.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `left + 1`.
   - The condition `left` is less than or equal to `right` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

5. **Updated State at the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - `i` remains `bottom + 1`.
   - `j` is updated to `left + 1`.
   - `left` and `right` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body (assuming no modifications are made in the loop).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`result` is a 2D list with boundary elements marked with `+`, `i` is `bottom + 1`, `j` is `left + 1`, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`.**
