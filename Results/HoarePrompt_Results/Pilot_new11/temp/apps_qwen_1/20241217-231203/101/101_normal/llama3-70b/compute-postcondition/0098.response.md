Postcondition: ***`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. If `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, then `frame_size` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `pixels` is a non-empty list with at least `n` rows, `i` is `n`, and every row of `pixels` is printed exactly once.***
