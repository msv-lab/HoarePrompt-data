Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `top` is None, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are all set to `n-1` and `m-1`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w' and `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`. `top` remains unchanged, and `bottom` and `left` also remain unchanged.***
