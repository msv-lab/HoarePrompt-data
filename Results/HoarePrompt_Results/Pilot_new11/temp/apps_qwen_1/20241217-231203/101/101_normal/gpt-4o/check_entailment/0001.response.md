Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where the smallest possible frame might not be returned. Let's examine a case where the program might fail:

Consider the input:
```
4 6
w.....
w.....
w.....
w.....
```

In this case, the smallest possible frame that satisfies the conditions would be a frame of size 1x1, centered around any of the white pixels. However, the program currently checks if `frame_height` and `frame_width` are both greater than or equal to 2 before constructing the frame. This condition will prevent the program from returning a 1x1 frame.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check for the smallest possible frame after determining the bounds of the white pixels. Here is an updated version of the function that handles this case correctly:

```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        # Explicitly handle the case where the smallest frame is 1x1
        result = [list(row) for row in screen]
        for i in range(max(0, top - 1), min(n, top + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, left - 1), min(m, right + 2)):
                if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                    if result[i][j] == '.':
                        result[i][j] = '+'
        return result
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result
```

With this modification, the program will correctly handle cases where the smallest possible frame is 1x1.
