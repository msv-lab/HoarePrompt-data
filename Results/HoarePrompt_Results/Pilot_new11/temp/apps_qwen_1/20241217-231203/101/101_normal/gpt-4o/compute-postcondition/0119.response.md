The code sets `top` to the value of `i` and `bottom` to the same value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`, so both `top` and `bottom` will be set to `n-1`. The other variables (`screen`, `j`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`**
