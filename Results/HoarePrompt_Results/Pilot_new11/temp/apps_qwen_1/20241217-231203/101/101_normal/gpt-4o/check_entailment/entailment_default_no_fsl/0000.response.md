Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not correctly handle the case where the entire screen is filled with '.' (black pixels). According to the problem description, if the required frame does not exist (i.e., the bounding box has a height or width less than 2), the function should return -1. However, the current implementation only checks for the case where the bounding box cannot be formed (i.e., no 'w' is found or the bounding box dimensions are less than 2) and returns -1 in that case. It does not consider the scenario where the entire screen is black.

To fix this, the code should include a check at the beginning to see if the entire screen is black. If it is, the function should immediately return -1. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    # Check if the entire screen is black
    if all('w' not in row for row in screen):
        return -1
    
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None:
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
    return result
```

This ensures that the function handles the case where the entire screen is black correctly.
