Postcondition: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are set to the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' pixels if there is at least one 'w' pixel, otherwise `top` and `bottom` are `None` and `left` and `right` are `m-1`, and `m` must be greater than 0. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is not 'w'.
