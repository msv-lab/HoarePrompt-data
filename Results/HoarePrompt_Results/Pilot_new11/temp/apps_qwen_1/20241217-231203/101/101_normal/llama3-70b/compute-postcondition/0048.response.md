The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, since there is no loop, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, and `pixels[i][j]` retain their original values.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` does not equal `min_y` or `max_y`, `pixels[i][j]` equals `'w'`.**
