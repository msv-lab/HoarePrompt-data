The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element in the `pixels` list at the index specified by `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` do not change, but the element `pixels[i][j]` now holds the value `'.'`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either `min_y + 2` or `max_y + 2`, and `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`.**
