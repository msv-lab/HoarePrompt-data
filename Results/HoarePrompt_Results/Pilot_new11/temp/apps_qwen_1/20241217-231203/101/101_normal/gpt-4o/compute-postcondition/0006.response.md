The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The value of `j` is the index within the 2D list `screen`, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `left` is `j`
- `right` is `j`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:

- `screen` is a 2D list of characters
- `i` and `j` are indices within the bounds of `screen`
- The value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'
- `top` is `i`
- `bottom` is `i`
- `top` was `None`

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are indices within the bounds of `screen`, the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`, and `top` was `None`.**
