The code assigns the current value of `i` to `bottom`. According to the precondition, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is set to `i`. In this case, `bottom` is simply assigned the value of `i`, regardless of whether `i` is less than `top` or not. The states of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `top`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `top` is unchanged if `i` is not less than `top`, otherwise `top` is set to `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is unchanged, `right` is unchanged.**
