To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the structure of the loop:

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the `white_pixels` list. Each tuple represents the coordinates of a 'w' pixel in the `pixels` grid.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `m` is the second integer input.
   - The input buffer contains `n` lines of `m` characters each.
   - `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains `m` characters.
   - `white_pixels` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i, j) of all 'w' pixels in the `pixels` grid.
   - `min_x` is initially set to `float('inf')`.
   - `min_y` is initially set to `float('inf')`.
   - `max_x` is initially set to `float('-inf')`.
   - `max_y` is initially set to `float('-inf')`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one tuple `(x, y)` in the `white_pixels` list. If `white_pixels` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `white_pixels` is non-empty. If `white_pixels` is empty, the loop will not iterate even once.
   - No other state needs to be specifically adjusted as long as `white_pixels` is non-empty, because the loop's execution solely depends on the contents of `white_pixels`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`white_pixels` must not be an empty list**
