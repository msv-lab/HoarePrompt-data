The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `n` must be the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` does not equal `min_y` or `max_y`, `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be the same as before, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` does not equal `min_y` or `max_y`, `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`**
