Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input to get the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the monitor.
   - It then constructs a 2D list `pixels` from the input, where each element is either `'.'` (black pixel) or `'w'` (white pixel).

2. **Finding White Pixels**:
   - The program identifies all the positions of white pixels and stores their coordinates in `white_pixels`.

3. **Determining Frame Size and Position**:
   - Using the coordinates of the white pixels, the program calculates the smallest rectangle that can enclose all white pixels.
   - Specifically, it determines the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, which helps in finding the bounding box of the white pixels.
   - The frame size is then calculated as the maximum difference between the corresponding coordinates plus one.

4. **Handling Invalid Frame Size**:
   - If the frame size exceeds the dimensions of the monitor (`n` or `m`), the program prints `-1`, indicating that no valid frame exists.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to construct the frame.

5. **Constructing the Frame**:
   - The program iterates over the entire grid and updates the pixels to form the frame.
   - It sets the boundary pixels (those that would be on the border of the smallest rectangle enclosing the white pixels) to `'+'`.
   - All other pixels, including those that were originally `'w'`, remain unchanged unless they are on the frame.

6. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, the program prints the modified grid, ensuring that the frame is correctly formed and all other pixels are as expected.

Since the program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description and handles all cases as specified, the program is correct.
