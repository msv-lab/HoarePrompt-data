Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `j` is an integer, and it is equal to `j+1` (which implies `j` is an integer).
   - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are integers.
   - If `i` equals `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `j` equals `right`, and `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is set to '+'.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `j` from `left` to `right + 1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the range `[left, right + 1)`. Since `j` is currently `j+1`, we need to subtract 1 to get the correct value of `j`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue depends on `j` being in this range.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` remains unchanged as no constraints are provided that would change its value.
- `j` is currently `j+1`, so for the loop to continue, `j` should be within the range `[left, right]`.
- The values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged as they are bounds for the range but not incremented or changed by the loop.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` remains the same.
- `j` should be `j` instead of `j+1` and should be within the range `[left, right]`.
- The constraints for changing `result[i][j]` to '+' remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are integers. If `i` equals `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `j` equals `right`, and `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is set to '+'. No changes occur if `result[i][j]` is not '.'. Additionally, `j` must be within the range `[left, right]` for the loop to execute again.**
