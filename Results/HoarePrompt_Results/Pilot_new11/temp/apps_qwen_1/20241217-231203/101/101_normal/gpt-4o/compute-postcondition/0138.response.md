The code assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. The initial value of `left` is `m-1`. Since the code simply updates `left` to `j`, the only change is in the value of `left`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `top` retains its original value (`n-1`), `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `m-1`.**
