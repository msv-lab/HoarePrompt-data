The code updates the variables `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum values between their current values and `x` and `y` respectively. Given the initial state, `max_x` and `max_y` will be updated to be the larger of their current values and the new values `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`white_pixels` must not be an empty list; `min_x` is the minimum value between `min_x` and `x`; `min_y` is the minimum value between `min_y` and `y`; `max_x` is the maximum value between `max_x` and `x`; `max_y` is the maximum value between `max_y` and `y`.**
