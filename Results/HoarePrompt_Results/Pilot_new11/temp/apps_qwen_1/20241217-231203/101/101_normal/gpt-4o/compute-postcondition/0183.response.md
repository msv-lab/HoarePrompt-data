The code `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `result[i][j]` to '+' if `result[i][j]` is '.', and `i` equals `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `j` equals `right`. Since the condition for updating `result[i][j]` is met, the value of `result[i][j]` is changed to '+'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are integers; `result[i][j]` is '+' if `result[i][j]` was '.' and `i` equals `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `j` equals `right`; no changes to other variables.**
