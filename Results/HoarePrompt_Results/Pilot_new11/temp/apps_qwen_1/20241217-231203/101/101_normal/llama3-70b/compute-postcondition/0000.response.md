The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from input and splits them into separate variables. It also reads `n` lines of exactly `m` characters each, which are stored in the input buffer but not assigned to any variables. The variables `n` and `m` are updated with the new values, but the content of the input buffer remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, the input buffer contains n lines of m characters each.**
