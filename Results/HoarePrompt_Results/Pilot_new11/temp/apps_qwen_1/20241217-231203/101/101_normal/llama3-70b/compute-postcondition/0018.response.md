To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and the requirements of the for loop.

### Given Conditions:
- `white_pixels` is not an empty list.
- `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels.
- `frame_size` is calculated as `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.
- The frame size is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.

### For Loop Analysis:
The for loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. The key variable involved in this loop is `i`, which will take values from `0` to `n-1` inclusively.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 until `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must start at `0` and `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

2. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer because if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.
   - We also need to ensure that `i` starts at `0` and increments properly within the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, and `n` must be a positive integer.**

In summary:
- `white_pixels` is not an empty list.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` are defined appropriately.
- `i` is initialized to `0`.
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
