The code snippet `pixels[i][j] = '.'` changes the pixel value at position `(i, j)` to `'.'`. Given the initial state, the variables `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are not directly affected by this line of code. However, the value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'.'`.

Since the exact coordinates `(i, j)` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific updated value in the `pixels` list. But we know that at these coordinates, the pixel value is now `'.'`.

Output State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer, `m` must be at least 1, and for all `i` and `j` where `(i, j)` are within the bounds of the frame, `((i != min_x and i != max_x and j != min_y and j != max_y) or pixels[i][j] != 'w')` and `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'` at the specific coordinates `(i, j)`.
