State before the loop starts: 
```
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `range(left, right + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate over all integers from `left` to `right` inclusive.

2. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the range `(left, right + 1)` must be non-empty. This means `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
   - The variable `j` will take on the values from `left` to `right` inclusive.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - Since no specific initial value for `j` is given, we assume `j` will be set to `left` at the start of the loop.
   - The variables `left` and `right` must be such that the range is valid and non-empty.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The state must ensure that `left` is less than or equal to `right`, otherwise the range will be empty and the loop will not execute.
   - At the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to `left`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
- `j` must be initialized to `left`.

State: **`left` is less than or equal to `right`, `j` is `left`**
