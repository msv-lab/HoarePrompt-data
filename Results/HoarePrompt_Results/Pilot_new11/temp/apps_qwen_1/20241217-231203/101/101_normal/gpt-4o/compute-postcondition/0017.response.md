Postcondition: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged. If `j < left`, then `left` is set to `j`. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged, and `bottom` is equal to `i` if `i > bottom`. Otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged. The current value of `j` is greater than `right`.**
