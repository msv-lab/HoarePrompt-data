Postcondition: ***`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`. If `top` is `None`, then `left` and `right` are both `0`. Otherwise, if `j > right`, then `left` is set to `j` and `right` remains unchanged; if `j < left`, then `right` is set to `j` and `left` remains unchanged; otherwise, the values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.***
