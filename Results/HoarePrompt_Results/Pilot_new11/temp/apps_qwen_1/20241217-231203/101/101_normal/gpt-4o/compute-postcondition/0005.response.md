The code sets `top` to the current value of `i` and `bottom` to the same value of `i`. The value of `screen[i][j]` remains 'w' and `top` was previously `None`, which is now assigned to `i`. The value of `bottom` is also `i`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` and `j` are indices within the bounds of `screen`, the value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, and `top` was `None`.**
