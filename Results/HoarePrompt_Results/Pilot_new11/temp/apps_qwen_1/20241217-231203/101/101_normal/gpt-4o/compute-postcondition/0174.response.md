Postcondition: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are integers. The current value of `i` is equal to `top` or `i` is equal to `bottom` or `j` is equal to `left` or `j` is equal to `right`. The value of `result[i][j]` is '.', meaning the current cell in the result matrix at position `[i][j]` is an empty character.**
