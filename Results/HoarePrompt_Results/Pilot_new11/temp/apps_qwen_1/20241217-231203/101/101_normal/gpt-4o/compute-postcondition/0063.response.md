The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial state specifies that the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', where `j` is less than `left`. This means `left` was originally greater than `j`.

After executing the line `left = j`, the value of `left` is updated to `j`, which is less than the original value of `left`. The other variables (`screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is not None, `bottom` and `right` remain unchanged, `left` is equal to `j`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
