`j` is assigned the value `1`, but in the given code snippet, `j` is used in the context of `pixels[i][j]`. This means that `pixels` is being accessed using index `i` and `j`, and the value at that position is set to `'.'`. However, since `i` is not defined in the provided initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `pixels[i][j]`. But we know that `j` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`j` is 1**
