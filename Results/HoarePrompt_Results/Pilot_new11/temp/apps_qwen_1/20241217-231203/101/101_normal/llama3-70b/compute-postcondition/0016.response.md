The code prints `-1`, which does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`. The current value of `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`.**
