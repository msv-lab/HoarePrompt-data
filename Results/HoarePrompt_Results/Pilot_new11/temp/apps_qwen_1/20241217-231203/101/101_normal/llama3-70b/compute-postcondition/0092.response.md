The code `print(''.join(row))` does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. It simply prints the content of the `row` variable, which is a concatenation of the elements in the `row` list. Since no assignment or modification to any variable is performed, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`pixels` must be a non-empty list (at least one row), and `i` is `n`, `m` is the same as before, `pixels[i][j]` for all `i` and `j` is either `'+', 'w',` or `'. '`, and a row from the `pixels` list is printed.**
