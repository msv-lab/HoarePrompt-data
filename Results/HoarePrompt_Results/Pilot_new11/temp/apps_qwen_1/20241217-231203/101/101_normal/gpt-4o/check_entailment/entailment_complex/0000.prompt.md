You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2000, and screen is a list of n strings, each string contains exactly m characters. The characters in the strings are either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), and at least one 'w' exists in the screen.
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel.
    if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel. All of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not None.
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if (frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `screen` is a 2D list of characters, `top` is the minimum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `bottom` is the maximum row index where there is a 'w' pixel, `left` is the minimum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `right` is the maximum column index where there is a 'w' pixel, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`. The height of the frame (`frame_height`) is at least 2, and the width of the frame (`frame_width`) is at least 2
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
                if result[i][j] == '.':
                    result[i][j] = '+'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is a 2D list where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with `+`, while all other elements remain unchanged.
    return result
    #`The program returns the 2D list 'result' where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows 'top' and 'bottom' and columns 'left' and 'right') are marked with '+'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2000, and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, each containing exactly `m` characters. These characters are either '.' (representing black pixels) or 'w' (representing white pixels), and at least one 'w' exists in the `screen`.

The function first identifies the bounding box of the white pixels ('w') in the `screen` by finding the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost positions of 'w'. If no 'w' is found, it returns -1. If the bounding box has a height or width less than 2, it also returns -1. Otherwise, it creates a copy of the `screen` and marks all the boundary elements of the bounding box with '+'.

Thus, the final state of the program after executing `func_1` is one of the following:
- The program returns -1 if no 'w' is found or if the bounding box has a height or width less than 2.
- The program returns a 2D list `result` where all elements at the boundaries (i.e., rows `top` and `bottom` and columns `left` and `right`) are marked with '+'.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The annotation mentions that the program returns -1 in multiple cases, but the actual code only includes one return statement within the `if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None)` block. This implies that if the bounding box dimensions are less than 2, the function should also return -1, which is already covered in the second condition check.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the entire `screen` is filled with '.'. In this case, the function would still find the bounding box but would return -1 because the width or height would be less than 2.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
