`pixels[i][j]` is assigned the value `+`. The value of `i` is either equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, or the value of `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`. The value of `pixels[i][j]` changes from `'.'` to `'+'.` The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is either equal to `min_x`, `max_x`, `n` is the same as before, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'.**
