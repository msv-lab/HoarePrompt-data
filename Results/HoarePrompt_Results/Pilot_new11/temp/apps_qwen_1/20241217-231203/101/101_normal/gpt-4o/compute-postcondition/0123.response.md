The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`, so `bottom` is now also `n-1`. The values of `top`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged according to the conditions provided.

Output State: **`screen` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top` retains its original value, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is `m-1`, `right` is `m-1`.**
