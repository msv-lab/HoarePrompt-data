The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any direct impact on the variables outside of a loop context. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state remains the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement does not modify any variables or affect the conditions specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`white_pixels` is not an empty list, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all `'w'` pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, and for all `i` and `j` where `(i, j)` are within the bounds of the frame, `((i != min_x and i != max_x and j != min_y and j != max_y) or pixels[i][j] != '.')`, and the condition `pixels[i][j] == 'w'` is true.**
