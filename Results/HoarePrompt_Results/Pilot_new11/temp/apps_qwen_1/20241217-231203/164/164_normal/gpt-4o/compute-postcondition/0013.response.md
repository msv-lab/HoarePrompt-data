The code assigns `True` to the variable `reachable`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, `T_pos`, and `pos`). Therefore, the output state includes the new assignment to `reachable` and keeps the values of the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`reachable` is `True`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, and `pos` is equal to `T_pos`.**
