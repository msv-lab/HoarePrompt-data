The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. After this operation, the original values of `n` and `k` are replaced by their integer representations. However, the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within certain ranges, but the actual values are not provided, so we keep these ranges but note that `n` and `k` are now explicitly converted to integers.

Output State: **2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1; `n` and `k` are integers**
