Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, and `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos + 1`. At the point where the if condition is checked, the character at index `pos` in `line` is '#'.***
