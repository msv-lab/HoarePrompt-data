The code `t = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `t`. Initially, `i` is 0. Therefore, `t` is also set to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is -1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not 'G', the current value of `s[i]` is 'T'**
