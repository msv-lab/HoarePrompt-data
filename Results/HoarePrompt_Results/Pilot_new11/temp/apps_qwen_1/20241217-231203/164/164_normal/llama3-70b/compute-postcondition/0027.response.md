Postcondition: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'G' does not appear), `t` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'T' does not appear), `i` is `n`, `g` is not -1, and `t` is not -1, `abs(t - g) % k != 0` or there exists at least one index `j` in the range `0` to `abs(t - g) // k` such that `s[(g + j * k) % n] == '#'`**
