The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect any of the variables `s`, `n`, `k`, `g`, `t`, `i`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'G' does not appear), `t` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in the string `s` (or -1 if 'T' does not appear), `i` is `n`, `g` is not -1, `t` is not -1, `abs(t - g)` is divisible by `k`, and for every integer `j` from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k`, the character at index `(g + j * k) % n` in `s` is not '#', and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
