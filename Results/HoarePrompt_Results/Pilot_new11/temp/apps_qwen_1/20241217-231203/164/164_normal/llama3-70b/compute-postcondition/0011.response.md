Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - \(1 \leq k \leq n - 1\).
   - `g` is 0 if `s[i]` is 'G', otherwise `g` is -1.
   - `t` is 0 if `s[i]` is 'T', otherwise `t` is -1.
   - `i` is 0 (indicating the loop just started).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the first iteration (`i = 0`), the loop variable `i` will be incremented to 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the loop body is executed once, `i` will become 1.
   - Since the condition `1 \leq k \leq n - 1` is still valid and `n > 0` remains true, the loop can continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Updated States**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.
   - The values of `g` and `t` depend on the current character in the string `s` at position `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`s` is a string input by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` - 1, `g` is 0 if `s[1]` is 'G', otherwise `g` is -1; `t` is 0 if `s[1]` is 'T' and -1 otherwise, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.**
