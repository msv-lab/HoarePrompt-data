You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' indicating empty cells, obstacles, the grasshopper's starting position, and the insect's position respectively. It is guaranteed that 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if (G_pos > T_pos) :
        G_pos, T_pos = T_pos, G_pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string from the user. If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, then `G_pos` is updated to the index of the first 'G' in `line`, and `T_pos` is updated to the index of the first 'T' in `line`. Otherwise, `G_pos` and `T_pos` retain their original values.
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `reachable` is `True` if the loop executes at least once, otherwise `False`; `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `line` is the input string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T', `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`, and `pos` is the last value it reached before breaking out of the loop (or retains its original value if the loop does not execute).
    if reachable :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `reachable` is a boolean indicating whether the loop executed at least once; `n` is the first integer input; `k` is the second integer input; `line` is a string containing at least one 'G' and one 'T'; `G_pos` is the index of the first 'G' in `line`; `T_pos` is the index of the first 'T' in `line`; `pos` is the last value it reached before breaking out of the loop (or retains its original value if the loop does not execute); if the loop executed (`reachable` is `True`), the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a string of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. If the inputs are valid, it returns a result based on the movement of the grasshopper from 'G' to 'T' considering the obstacle; otherwise, it returns an error message.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
