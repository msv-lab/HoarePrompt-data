Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is the final value determined by the loop, `high` is 0, `mid` is the last calculated value of \((\text{high} + 1) // 2\), `total` is the sum of \(\min(\text{mid}, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v`. The sum of \(\min(\text{low}, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v` is not equal to `s`. If the loop terminates with `low` being less than `high`, `low` and `high` represent the range such that no value within this range satisfies the condition `total >= s`. If `low` equals `high`, `low` is the value where `total` is closest to but still less than `s`, and `high` is 0.**
