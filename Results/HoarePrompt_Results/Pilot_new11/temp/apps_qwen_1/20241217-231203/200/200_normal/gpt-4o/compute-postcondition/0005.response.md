The code `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console. This does not change the values of the existing variables `n`, `s`, `volumes`, or `total_volume`. The only change is that `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\); `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\); `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with the total volume of `volumes` being less than `s`; `total_volume` is the sum of all elements in `volumes` and is currently less than `s`; -1 is printed to the console.**
