Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `total_volume` is the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0] - ((remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n)` if `remaining_kvass > 0`. If `remaining_kvass` is not greater than 0, the values of `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were before the if-else block.***
