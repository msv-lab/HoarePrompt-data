The variable `low` is assigned the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is (high + 1) // 2, `high` is greater than 0, `mid` is (high + 1) // 2, `total` is the sum of min(mid, x) for each x in v, and the total is less than s; `low` is now (high + 1) // 2**
