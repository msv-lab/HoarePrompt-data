The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing any of the remaining code in the body of the loop. Since no specific variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `total_volume` is the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is either 0 or `volumes[0] - volumes[1]`, `i` is 2, and `possible_to_take` is `volumes[1] - volumes[0]` if `i` is 1.**
