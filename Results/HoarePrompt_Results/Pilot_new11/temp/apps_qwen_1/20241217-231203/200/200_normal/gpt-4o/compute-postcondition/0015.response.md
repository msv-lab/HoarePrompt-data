Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `total_volume` is the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is either equal to `s` or `s - s` (which is 0), and `i` is 0. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, then `remaining_kvass` remains `s`; otherwise, `remaining_kvass` becomes 0.***
