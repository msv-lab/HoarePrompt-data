The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `v`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12.
- `v` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.

Case_1: The function returns the sum of all elements in the list `v`.
Case_2: The function returns the difference between `s` and the sum of all elements in the list `v`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters `n`, `s`, and `v` and return either the sum of all elements in the list `v` or the difference between `s` and the sum of all elements in the list `v`.
