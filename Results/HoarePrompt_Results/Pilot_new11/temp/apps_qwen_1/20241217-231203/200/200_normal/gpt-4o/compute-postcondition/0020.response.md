The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing any of the subsequent statements in the current iteration. Since no specific action or assignment is performed in the current iteration when `continue` is encountered, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `s` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `total_volume` is the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `remaining_kvass` is 0, and `i` is 2**
