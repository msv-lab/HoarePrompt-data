`low` is reassigned the value of `mid`. The value of `high` remains unchanged, and the value of `mid` remains the ceiling of the average of `low` and `high`. The value of `total` also remains unchanged since it is dependent on `mid` and `x` in `v`, which are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`low` is equal to `mid`, `high` is greater than `low`, `mid` is the ceiling of the average of `low` and `high`, `total` is the sum of min(`mid`, `x`) for each `x` in `v`.**
