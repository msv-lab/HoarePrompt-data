Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the final amount of kvass in the least keg is maximized when it should. 

Consider the following example:
Input:
```
3 5
4 3 5
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the program will output:
```
2
```

The issue lies in the way the program calculates `min_keg_volume`. The program attempts to distribute the `s` liters among the kegs but does not ensure that the least keg is filled to its maximum possible amount while still meeting the requirement. A correct approach would involve a more complex redistribution strategy to ensure the least keg has the maximum possible amount of kvass.

To fix this, we need to use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a binary search combined with a feasibility check, to determine the maximum amount of kvass that can be in the least keg while ensuring the total volume of kvass poured is at least `s`.
