The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and `v`. 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
- `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12.
- `v` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.

The function aims to find the smallest integer `x` such that the sum of the minimum of `x` and each element in the sorted list `v` is at least `s`. If no such `x` exists, it returns `-1`.

The steps it follows are:
1. It first reads `n`, `s`, and `v` from standard input.
2. It sorts the list `v` in ascending order.
3. It uses binary search to find the smallest `x` satisfying the condition.
4. After the binary search loop, it checks if the sum of the minimum values calculated with `low` meets the requirement. If not, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `low`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the input `n` or `s` are out of their specified ranges, the function will raise an error due to incorrect input handling.
- The function assumes that the input list `v` is valid and contains only positive integers. If invalid inputs are provided, the function may produce incorrect results.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the initial values of `low` and `high` might not cover the possible range of solutions. However, since `low` starts at 0 and `high` at the minimum value in `v`, it should work correctly in practice.
- The function does not provide any feedback or handle invalid input types other than integers.
