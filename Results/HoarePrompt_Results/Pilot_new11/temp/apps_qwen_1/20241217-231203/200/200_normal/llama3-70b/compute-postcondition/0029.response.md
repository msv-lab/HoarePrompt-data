Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is the final value determined by the loop, `high` is 0, `mid` is the last calculated value of \((\text{high} + 1) // 2\), `total` is the sum of \(\min(\text{mid}, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v`. If the sum of \(\min(low, x)\) for each \( x \) in `v` is not equal to `s`, the output is `-1`; otherwise, `low` is printed.***
