The code `a *= 3` multiplies the current value of `a` by 3 and assigns the result back to `a`. Since `a` is an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and `a` <= `b`, the new value of `a` will be `a * 3`. The values of `b` and `years` remain unchanged.

Let's consider the possible range of `a`:

- If `a` was originally 1, then `a` becomes 3.
- If `a` was originally 2, then `a` becomes 6.
- If `a` was originally 3, then `a` becomes 9.
- If `a` was originally 4, then `a` becomes 12, which is outside the range of 1 to 10, so it would be adjusted to 10 (the maximum allowed value).
- This logic applies similarly for other values up to 10.

Given these considerations, the updated value of `a` will be one of the following: 3, 6, 9, or 10, depending on its original value. The value of `b` remains between 1 and 10, and `years` remains 0.

Output State: **`a` is 3, 6, 9, or 10; `b` is an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive) such that `a` <= `b`; `years` is 0**
