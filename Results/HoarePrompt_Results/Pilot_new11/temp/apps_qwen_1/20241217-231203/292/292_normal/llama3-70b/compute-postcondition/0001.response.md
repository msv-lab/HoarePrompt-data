The code `years = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `years`. This initializes `years` but does not affect the values of `a` and `b`. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, and both satisfy \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\); the value of `b` is the second integer entered by the user; `years` is 0.**
