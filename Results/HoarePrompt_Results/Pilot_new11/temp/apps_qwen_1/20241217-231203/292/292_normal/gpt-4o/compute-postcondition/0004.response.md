`b` is multiplied by 2. Since `a` is 3, 6, 9, or 10 and `a` <= `b`, `b` can be 3, 6, 9, or 10. Multiplying these by 2 results in `b` being 6, 12, 18, or 20 respectively. However, since `b` was originally between 1 and 10, the only valid new value for `b` is 6 (from 3 * 2). The values of `a` and `years` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 3, 6, 9, or 10; `b` is 6; `years` is 0**
