Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. The output hints confirm that the program iterates, tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, counting the number of iterations. This logic aligns with the problem description and the examples provided. The program handles all valid inputs within the specified constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) and produces the correct output for each scenario. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
