Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the user, which is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Loop Logic**: The program uses a `while` loop to continuously triple Limak’s weight (\(a\)) and double Bob’s weight (\(b\)) until \(a > b\). This logic ensures that Limak's weight will eventually exceed Bob's weight.
3. **Counter Increment**: A counter (`years`) is incremented each time the loop runs, correctly tracking the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.
4. **Output**: The program prints the number of years required for Limak to become larger than Bob, which matches the expected output as described in the problem statement.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately for all valid inputs (as per the assumptions), the correctness is True.
