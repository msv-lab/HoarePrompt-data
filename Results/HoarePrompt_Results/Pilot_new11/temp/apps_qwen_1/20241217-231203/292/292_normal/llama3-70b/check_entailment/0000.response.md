Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. The logic of tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight each year is correctly implemented in the while loop. The program increments the year counter until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the loop will terminate within a reasonable number of iterations, ensuring the solution is accurate for all valid inputs.
