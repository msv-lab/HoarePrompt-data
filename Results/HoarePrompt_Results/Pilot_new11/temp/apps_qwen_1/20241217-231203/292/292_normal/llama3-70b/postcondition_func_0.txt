The function reads two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\)) from the user, then enters a loop where \(a\) is tripled and \(b\) is doubled in each iteration. The loop continues until \(a\) exceeds \(b\). After the loop ends, the function prints the number of iterations performed. The final state of the program is that the output is the number of iterations, and \(a\) and \(b\) are no longer within the initial constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).
