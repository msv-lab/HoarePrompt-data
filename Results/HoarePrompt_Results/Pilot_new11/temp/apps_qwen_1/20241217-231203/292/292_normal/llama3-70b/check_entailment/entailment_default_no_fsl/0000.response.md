Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The code then enters a loop where Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled each year. The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. Finally, the code outputs the number of years it took for this condition to be met.

Let's verify this against the examples provided:

1. **Input:** `4 7`
   - **Initial weights:** Limak = 4, Bob = 7
   - **Year 1:** Limak = 4 * 3 = 12, Bob = 7 * 2 = 14 (Limak is still not larger)
   - **Year 2:** Limak = 12 * 3 = 36, Bob = 14 * 2 = 28 (Limak is now larger)
   - **Output:** 2 (Correct)

2. **Input:** `4 9`
   - **Initial weights:** Limak = 4, Bob = 9
   - **Year 1:** Limak = 4 * 3 = 12, Bob = 9 * 2 = 18 (Limak is still not larger)
   - **Year 2:** Limak = 12 * 3 = 36, Bob = 18 * 2 = 36 (Limak is still not larger)
   - **Year 3:** Limak = 36 * 3 = 108, Bob = 36 * 2 = 72 (Limak is now larger)
   - **Output:** 3 (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1 1`
   - **Initial weights:** Limak = 1, Bob = 1
   - **Year 1:** Limak = 1 * 3 = 3, Bob = 1 * 2 = 2 (Limak is now larger)
   - **Output:** 1 (Correct)

Since the code handles all given examples correctly and follows the logic of the problem statement for every potential case within the constraints, the program is correct.
