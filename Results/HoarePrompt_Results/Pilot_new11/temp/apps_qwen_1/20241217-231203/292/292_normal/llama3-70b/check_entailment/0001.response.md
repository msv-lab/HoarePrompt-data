Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob based on the given rules. The program iterates using a while loop, tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight each year until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The number of iterations (years) is counted and printed. This approach works for all given test cases and potential cases within the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10). The program handles all edge cases, such as when Limak and Bob have equal weights initially (e.g., input 1 1), and it correctly increments the year count until Limak becomes strictly larger than Bob.
