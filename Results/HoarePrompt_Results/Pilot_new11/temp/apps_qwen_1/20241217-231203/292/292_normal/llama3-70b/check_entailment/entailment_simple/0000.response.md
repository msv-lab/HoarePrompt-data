Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two space-separated integers as input, representing the initial weights of Limak (`a`) and Bob (`b`). The input handling is straightforward and adheres to the constraints given in the problem description.

2. **Weight Calculation Loop**:
   - The program initializes `years` to 0, representing the number of years that have passed.
   - It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
   - In each iteration of the loop, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
   - The `years` counter is incremented by 1 after each iteration of the loop.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop terminates when Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight.
   - At this point, the value of `years` represents the number of full years required for Limak to become larger than Bob.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `years`, which is the number of full years required for Limak to become larger than Bob.

Given the problem constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program ensures that Limak's weight will eventually surpass Bob's weight, and it counts the exact number of years needed. Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs within the specified range.
