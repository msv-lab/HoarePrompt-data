The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. Since `b` is initially between 4 and 40 inclusive, after multiplication, `b` will be between 8 and 80 inclusive. The value of `a` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is between 27 and 270 inclusive; `b` is between 8 and 80 inclusive.

Output State: **`a` is between 27 and 270 inclusive; `b` is between 8 and 80 inclusive**
