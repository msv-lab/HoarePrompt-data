The code assigns the value of `y` to `min_downvotes`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, and `max_upvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer entered by the user (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`**
