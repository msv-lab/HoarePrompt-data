The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some internal logic involving non-negative integers x, y, and z within the range of 0 to 100.

Given the constraints, the function likely evaluates x, y, and z internally and returns a specific value or values based on their relationships. However, since no specific logic or outputs are provided, we can only describe the accepted range of values for internal use.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the internal evaluation of non-negative integers x, y, and z within the range of 0 to 100.**
