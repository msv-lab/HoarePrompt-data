Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes. The logic of the program accurately determines the output based on the given conditions:

1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `-`.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `+`.
3. Otherwise, it prints `?`.

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases, including when the result is uncertain. The output hints confirm that the program behaves as expected for all given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
