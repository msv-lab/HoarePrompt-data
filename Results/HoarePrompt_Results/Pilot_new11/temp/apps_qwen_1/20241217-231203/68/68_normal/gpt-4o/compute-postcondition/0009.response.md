The code `print('+')` simply prints a plus sign to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100), `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, the condition `max_upvotes >= min_downvotes` holds true, and `max_downvotes` is lower than `min_upvotes`. A plus sign is printed to the console.**
