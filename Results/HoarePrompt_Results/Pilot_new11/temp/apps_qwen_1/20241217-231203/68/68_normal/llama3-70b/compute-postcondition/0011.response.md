The code `print('?')` does not change the values of any variables. It simply prints a question mark to the console. Therefore, the only change is that the output of the program will include the printed question mark, but the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer. Both `x` and `y + z` satisfy the condition `x >= y`, and all values are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The current value of `x` is not equal to `y` + `z`. The output includes a printed question mark.**
