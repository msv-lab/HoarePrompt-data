The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are mentioned in the constraints but are not passed to the function. Based on the constraints, `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\). However, since these parameters are not part of the function's signature, we cannot determine their usage within the function.

Given the lack of information about the function's body and its return value, the only thing we can deduce is the range of the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters.**
