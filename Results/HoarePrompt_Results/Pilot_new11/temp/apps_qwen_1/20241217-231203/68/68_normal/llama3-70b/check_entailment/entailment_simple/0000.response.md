Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the input, which matches the problem description.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If \(x > y + z\), the program prints `+`, meaning more people will upvote than downvote.
   - If \(x < y\), the program prints `-`, meaning more people will downvote than upvote.
   - If \(x == y\):
     - If \(z == 0\), the program prints `0`, meaning the result is exactly balanced.
     - If \(z != 0\), the program prints `?`, indicating the result is uncertain because the votes from the unknown individuals could tip the balance either way.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \(x == y\) and \(z \neq 0\), as this results in an uncertain outcome.
   - The program also handles the cases where \(x\) is greater than or less than \(y + z\) appropriately.

4. **Range Validation**: Although the problem description specifies \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 100\), the program does not explicitly validate these bounds. However, since the input is assumed to be valid, this omission does not affect the correctness of the program.

5. **Output Format**: The program produces the correct output (`+`, `-`, `0`, or `?`) based on the given conditions, matching the problem requirements.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases, the program is correct.
