Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program calculates the number of changes needed based on whether the permutation value matches the index and the value in the sequence `b`, but this approach does not guarantee that every skewer will visit all 2n placements.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

According to the problem statement, the permutation needs to be adjusted such that every skewer visits all 2n placements. In the given example, the permutation is `4, 3, 2, 1` and all elements in `b` are `0`. This means Pavel would not reverse any skewers.

However, the current implementation counts the number of positions where `p[i] != i + 1` and the number of zeros in `b`. This is not sufficient to ensure that each skewer visits all 2n placements. For instance, in the given example, the permutation already ensures that each skewer will visit all positions (albeit not in both directions initially), and changing just one element in `b` might be enough to achieve the goal. 

A more accurate solution would involve ensuring that each skewer can be moved in both forward and backward directions through appropriate modifications to the permutation and sequence `b`. The provided program does not account for these necessary adjustments, hence it fails to meet the problem's requirements in all cases.
