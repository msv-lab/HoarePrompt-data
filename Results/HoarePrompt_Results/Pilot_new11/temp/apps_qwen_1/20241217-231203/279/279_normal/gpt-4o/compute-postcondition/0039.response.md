The code appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Given that `x` is already part of `cycle` (since `cycle` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements, including the value of `x`), appending `x` again to `cycle` will add another instance of `x` to the list. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where at least one element is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` which now includes the value of `x` twice, `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`, `cycle` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements with the value of `x` appearing twice, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.**
