Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0; `p` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `visited` is a list of `n` elements where at least one element is `True` (corresponding to the value of `x` that satisfies `not visited[i]`); `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` which includes the sequence of values that `x` took during the loop execution; `x` is `p[x] - 1` and is within the range `[0, n-1]`.***
