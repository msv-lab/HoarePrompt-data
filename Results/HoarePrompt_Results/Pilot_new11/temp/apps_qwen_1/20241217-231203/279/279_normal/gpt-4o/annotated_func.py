#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), representing the number of skewers. The second line contains a permutation of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n). The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones.

    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))

            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the loop execution, each cycle is a list of integers representing the sequence of indices `x` followed during the loop execution.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the loop execution, each cycle is a list of integers representing the sequence of indices `x` followed during the loop execution, `no_reverse_components` is the count of cycles in `cycles` where every element satisfies `b[x] == 0`. The output of the program is `0` if `len(cycles) == 1`, otherwise it is `no_reverse_components` if it is greater than 0, otherwise 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three lines of input: an integer \( n \), a permutation of integers, and a sequence of zeros and ones. It then identifies all cycles in the permutation and checks each cycle to determine if all elements within the cycle satisfy the condition \( b[x] == 0 \). If there is only one cycle, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of cycles where all elements satisfy \( b[x] == 0 \), unless this count is zero, in which case it prints 1.
