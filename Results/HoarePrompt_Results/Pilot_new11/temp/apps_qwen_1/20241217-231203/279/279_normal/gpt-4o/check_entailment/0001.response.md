Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not account for the requirement that each skewer must visit every of its 2n placements, considering both original and reversed directions.

Here is a counterexample:

For \( n = 4 \), let's consider the following input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
1 0 0 0
```

According to the problem description, Pavel needs to ensure that each skewer visits every of its 2n placements. However, with the given permutation and sequence:
- Skewer 1 is initially at position 1 and needs to visit positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 1', 2', 3', 4' (where ' denotes the reversed direction).
- Skewer 2 is initially at position 2 and needs to visit positions 2, 1, 3, 4, 2', 1', 3', 4'.
- Skewer 3 is initially at position 3 and needs to visit positions 3, 2, 1, 4, 3', 2', 1', 4'.
- Skewer 4 is initially at position 4 and needs to visit positions 4, 3, 2, 1, 4', 3', 2', 1'.

With the given permutation `p = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and the sequence `b = [1, 0, 0, 0]`, the program incorrectly calculates that only one change is needed, but in reality, more changes are required to ensure each skewer visits all placements.

The program fails to correctly identify that multiple changes may be necessary to achieve the desired result. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
