The code appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Before the code execution, `x` is defined as `p[i_new] - 1`, and `cycle` is initialized as `[x]`. After appending `x` to `cycle`, `cycle` will be `[x, x]`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. `cycle` was initially `[x]`.
2. The code `cycle.append(x)` appends `x` to `cycle`, making `cycle` become `[x, x]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` plus the previous elements, `x` is now `p[i_new] - 1`, `cycle` is `[x, x]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `i_new` is less than `n`, and `visited[x]` is `True`**
