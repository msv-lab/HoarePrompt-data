The function reads three lines of input: an integer \( n \), a permutation of integers, and a sequence of zeros and ones. It then identifies all cycles in the permutation and checks each cycle to determine if all elements within the cycle satisfy the condition \( b[x] == 0 \). If there is only one cycle, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of cycles where all elements satisfy \( b[x] == 0 \), unless this count is zero, in which case it prints 1.
