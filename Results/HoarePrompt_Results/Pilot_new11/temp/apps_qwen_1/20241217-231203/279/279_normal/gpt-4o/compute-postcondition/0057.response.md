The code snippet appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `p` remains unchanged
- `b` remains unchanged
- `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True`, and the element at index `x` (where `x = p[p[i_new] - 1] - 1`) is now `True`
- `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` plus the previous elements
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `i_new` is less than `n`
- `visited[x]` is `True`

After appending `x` to `cycle`, the updated `cycle` will include the new value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `p` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `visited` is a list of `n` elements where all elements in `cycle` are marked as `True`, and the element at index `x` (where `x = p[p[i_new] - 1] - 1`) is now `True`; `cycles` is a list containing the list `cycle` plus the previous elements; `i` is incremented by 1; `i_new` is less than `n`; `visited[x]` is `True`; `cycle` includes the new value of `x`**
