Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem, Memory needs to transform an equilateral triangle with side length `x` into one with side length `y` by changing the length of a single side per second, ensuring that the resulting shape remains a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., the triangle inequality must hold).

The program simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not account for the constraints of maintaining a valid triangle during the transformation. For example, consider the input `(10, 4)`:

- Starting with a side length of 10, the program would output `abs(10 - 4) = 6`.
- However, the correct transformation would involve reducing the side length step-by-step while maintaining the triangle inequality. A possible sequence could be: `10 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4`, which requires 6 seconds.

Therefore, the program fails to provide the correct minimum number of seconds required for the transformation.
