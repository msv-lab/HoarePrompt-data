Functionality: **The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from standard input, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. It then calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints this value. The function does not return any value but modifies the output stream by printing the result. There are no parameters passed to the function.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input values are valid integers within the specified range. If non-integer values are entered, the program will raise a `ValueError`.
- The function does not handle the case where the input values do not satisfy the condition `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. If invalid inputs are provided, the program will still attempt to calculate and print the absolute difference, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.
- The function does not provide any error handling or feedback for invalid inputs, which could lead to confusion or incorrect results if the input constraints are not met.
