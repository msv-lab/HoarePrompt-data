The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.

However, since no specific output logic is provided, we can only state the constraints on the parameters `x` and `y` without specifying the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.**
