Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is the original value of `b`.
   - `b` is updated to `a % b`.
   - `k_3` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k_3 \leq 1500\).

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs as long as `b` is non-zero (`while b`).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: 
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Current State After Previous Iteration**: 
   - `a` is still the original value of `b` (let's denote this as `original_b`).
   - `b` is updated to `a % b` (let's denote this as `updated_b`).
   - We need to ensure that `updated_b` is non-zero for the loop to continue.

5. **Analysis**:
   - If `b` is zero after the previous iteration, then the loop would terminate.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop continues, `b` must be non-zero at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `b` is updated to `a % b`, we need to ensure that `a % b` is non-zero.
   - This means `b` must not be zero after the current iteration.
   - Additionally, `a` should still hold the original value of `b`.

7. **Final State**:
   - `a` remains the original value of `b`.
   - `b` must be non-zero for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, and `b` must be non-zero**
