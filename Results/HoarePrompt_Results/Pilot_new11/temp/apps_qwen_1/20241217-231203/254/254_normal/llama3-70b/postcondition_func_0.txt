The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It performs the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Specifically, it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, the value of `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. However, the function incorrectly returns `0` instead of the computed GCD. This is a logical error in the function, as the intended behavior should be to return the value of `a` (which holds the GCD), not `0`.
