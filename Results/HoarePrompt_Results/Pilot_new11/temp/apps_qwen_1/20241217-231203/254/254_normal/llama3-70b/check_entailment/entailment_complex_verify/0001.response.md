Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided annotated version clearly shows that the function `func_1` incorrectly returns 0 instead of the greatest common divisor (GCD) calculated using the Euclidean algorithm. This logical error in the function means that the calculation of the least common multiple (LCM) in the main part of the program is flawed. Specifically, the LCM calculation relies on the GCD values, and since `func_1` returns 0, the LCM calculation will also be incorrect.

The annotated version confirms that the function should return the GCD but currently returns 0, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description requirements, and the final assessment remains **False**.
