Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used to determine if Mishka can light up the tree using the given intervals is flawed. Specifically, the approach using the least common multiple (LCM) is incorrect for determining whether it's possible to light up the tree continuously.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect LCM Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the LCM of the three intervals (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`) using the formula `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))`.
   - However, this formula is incorrect. The correct way to calculate the LCM of three numbers is to use the property that \(\text{lcm}(a, b, c) = \text{lcm}(\text{lcm}(a, b), c)\). This cannot be simplified directly as shown in the code.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - While the GCD calculation itself is correct, the usage in the LCM calculation is incorrect.

3. **Logical Error:**
   - The condition `if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):` checks if the LCM is divisible by all three intervals. This is not a sufficient condition to ensure that each second is covered.
   - For example, consider the input `k1 = 2`, `k2 = 2`, `k3 = 3`. The LCM of 2, 2, and 3 is 6, and it is divisible by 2 and 3, but it is not divisible by 2 twice, which means there will be gaps in coverage.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, one should check if the GCD of all three intervals is 1. If the GCD of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, it is always possible to find a moment to turn on the garlands such that they cover all seconds. Otherwise, it is impossible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def main():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate the GCD of all three intervals
    gcd_all = gcd(gcd(k1, k2), k3)
    
    if gcd_all == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Reading:** 
   - Reads the three intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.

2. **GCD Calculation:**
   - Computes the GCD of all three intervals using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - If the GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to light up the tree continuously.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This approach ensures that the solution is correct according to the problem description.
