Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals, but it contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function incorrectly returns `0` instead of the computed greatest common divisor (GCD). This is a critical mistake because the LCM calculation relies on the GCD.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following:

1. **Incorrect GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function should calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. Instead, it incorrectly returns `0`. For example, `func_1(4, 2)` should return `2`, but the current implementation returns `0`. This incorrect GCD calculation will lead to an incorrect LCM calculation.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM calculation is based on the incorrect GCD values. For example, with inputs `(2, 2, 3)`, the correct GCD values should be calculated correctly, but due to the error in `func_1`, the LCM calculation will be incorrect. The program should check if the calculated LCM is divisible by all three input values (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`). However, because `func_1` returns `0`, the LCM calculation will fail.

Given the above points, the program cannot correctly determine whether it is possible to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
