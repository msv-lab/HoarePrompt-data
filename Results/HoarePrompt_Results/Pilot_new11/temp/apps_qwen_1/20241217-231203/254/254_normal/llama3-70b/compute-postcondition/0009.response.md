Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It performs the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Specifically, it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, the value of `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. However, the function incorrectly returns `0` instead of the computed GCD. This is a logical error in the function, as the intended behavior should be to return the value of `a` (which holds the GCD), not `0`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If `a` and `b` are both zero, the loop does not execute, and the function returns `0` incorrectly.
- If either `a` or `b` is negative, the function does not handle this case correctly, as the Euclidean algorithm requires non-negative integers. The correct behavior would be to take the absolute values of `a` and `b` before applying the algorithm.

In conclusion, the function should be modified to return `a` (the GCD) instead of `0`, and it should handle edge cases where `a` and `b` are both zero and where `a` or `b` are negative.
