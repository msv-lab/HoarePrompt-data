You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using the Least Common Multiple (LCM) approach. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. The `lcm` calculation is incorrect. The formula used in the code does not correctly compute the LCM of three numbers. The LCM of three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by \(\frac{a \times b \times c}{\text{lcm}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(b, c) \times \text{lcm}(a, c)}\). However, the current implementation uses a simplified version that may not always yield the correct result.

2. The `func_1` function is incorrectly named and not used to calculate the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) properly. The function should be renamed to `gcd` and used correctly to compute the LCM.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

lcm_k1_k2 = lcm(k1, k2)
lcm_k2_k3 = lcm(k2, k3)
lcm_k1_k3 = lcm(k1, k3)

lcm_all = lcm(lcm_k1_k2, lcm_k2_k3)

if lcm_all % k1 == 0 and lcm_all % k2 == 0 and lcm_all % k3 == 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the LCM is calculated correctly and checks if it is divisible by all three given values, which is the required condition for Mishka to light at least one garland each second.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It performs the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Specifically, it repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, the value of `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. However, the function incorrectly returns `0` instead of the computed GCD. This is a logical error in the function, as the intended behavior should be to return the value of `a` (which holds the GCD), not `0`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
