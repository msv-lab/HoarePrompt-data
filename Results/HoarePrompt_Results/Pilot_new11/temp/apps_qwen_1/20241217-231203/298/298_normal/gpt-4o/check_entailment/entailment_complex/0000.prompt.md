You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, and the area is \((n_input * m_input) / k_input\). If \(2 * area \leq m_input\), the output is `1 0`. Otherwise, the output is `0` followed by `m // 2`.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, and the area is \((n_input * m_input) / k_input\). If \(2 * area \leq n_input\), the output is "0 1". Otherwise, if \(2 * area \leq m_input\), the output is "1 0". Otherwise, the output is "0" followed by `m // 2`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, and `area` is \((n_input * m_input) / k_input\). If `area` is 0, the print statement outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, if \(2 * area \leq n_input\), the output is "0 1". If \(2 * area \leq m_input\) and the previous condition is not met, the output is "1 0". If neither of the above conditions is met, the output is "0" followed by `m // 2`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`. If `area` (which is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`) is not an integer, the print statement 'NO' is executed. If `area` is 0, the print statement outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, if \(2 * area \leq n_input\), the output is "0 1". If \(2 * area \leq m_input\) and the previous condition is not met, the output is "1 0". If neither of the above conditions is met, the output is "0" followed by `m // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) from input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\). It calculates the area as \(\frac{n \times m}{k}\) and checks if this area is an integer. If the area is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If the area is zero, it also prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then proceeds to print coordinates based on certain conditions:

1. If \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\), it prints "0 1".
2. If \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) but \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\), it prints "1 0".
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "0" followed by \(m // 2\).

After these operations, the function does not return anything explicitly; however, it prints the necessary information to the console based on the given conditions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
