Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code provides clear insights into how the program works. It correctly handles the problem statement by checking if a solution exists based on the condition \(nm \mod k == 0\). If the condition is met, it proceeds to compute the necessary coefficients using the extended Euclidean algorithm and constructs the coordinates of the three points that form a triangle with the desired area.

The key steps are:
1. It checks if \(nm \mod k == 0\) to ensure a valid solution exists.
2. It uses the extended GCD to find coefficients that help in constructing the points.
3. It ensures the computed coordinates satisfy the constraints and form a triangle with the required area.

Given these annotations and the fact that the program meets the problem description and handles the constraints appropriately, the original assessment of **False** is not accurate. Therefore, the correct final assessment is **True**.
