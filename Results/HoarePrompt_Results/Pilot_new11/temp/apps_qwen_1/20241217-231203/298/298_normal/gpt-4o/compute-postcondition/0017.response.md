The code prints `1 0`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `area`, or the condition `2 * area` being less than or equal to `m_input`. The only change is the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is `n_input`, `m` is `m_input`, `k` is `k_input`, `area` is `(n_input * m_input) / k_input`, the area is not equal to 0, and `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m_input`, and the output is `1 0`.**
