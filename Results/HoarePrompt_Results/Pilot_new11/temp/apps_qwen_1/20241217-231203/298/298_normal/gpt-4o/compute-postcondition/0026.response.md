Functionality: **The function reads three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) from input, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 10^9\). It calculates the area as \(\frac{n \times m}{k}\) and checks if this area is an integer. If the area is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If the area is zero, it also prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then proceeds to print coordinates based on certain conditions:

1. If \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\), it prints "0 1".
2. If \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) but \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\), it prints "1 0".
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "0" followed by \(m // 2\).

After these operations, the function does not return anything explicitly; however, it prints the necessary information to the console based on the given conditions.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the calculated area is zero, the function will print 'NO'.
- If \(2 \times \text{area} > m\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > n\), the function will print "0" followed by \(m // 2\), which handles the case where both conditions fail.**

This summary covers all the possible scenarios based on the actual code and includes the necessary edge cases.
