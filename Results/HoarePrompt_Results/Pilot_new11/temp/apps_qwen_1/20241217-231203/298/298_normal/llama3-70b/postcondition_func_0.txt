The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is such that the variable `a` holds the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This holds true for all positive integer inputs. There are no edge cases where the function behaves differently; the algorithm is robust for all positive integers.
