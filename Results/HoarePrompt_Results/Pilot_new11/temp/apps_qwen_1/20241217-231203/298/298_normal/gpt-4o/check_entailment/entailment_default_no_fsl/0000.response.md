Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not cover all potential cases where the area of the triangle could be achieved. Specifically, the code does not consider the case where both \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) and \(2 \times \text{area} > m\). This means that the code may fail to find valid coordinates for certain values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).

For example, consider the input:
```
5 5 5
```

- The area of the triangle should be \(\frac{5 \times 5}{5} = 5\).
- Since 2 \(\times\) 5 = 10, which is greater than both 5 and 5, the current logic does not handle this case correctly.

A correct approach would need to consider additional cases where both dimensions are too small to accommodate the required area directly. Here is an improved version of the code that addresses this issue:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            # Ensure we can place the points within the grid
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
                print(f'1 0')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
                print(f'0 1')
            else:
                # When both 2*area > n and 2*area > m
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                print(f'{n // 2} {m}')

func()
```

This improved version ensures that the code covers all potential cases by providing valid coordinates even when both dimensions are too small to directly accommodate the required area.
