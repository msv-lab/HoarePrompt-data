The function `func_2(a, b)` is called with parameters `a` and `b`. Since the function name is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact values that `x` and `y` will take. However, we know that `x` and `y` will be assigned values as a result of this function call. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `k` also remains unchanged because it is not involved in the function call.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, `k` is a positive integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are the values returned by `func_2(a, b)`**
