Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The provided annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling Non-Integer Area**:
   - The program correctly checks if the calculated area (`area = n * m / k`) is an integer. If it is not, the program prints "NO", which is correct.
   
2. **Case When Area is Zero**:
   - If the area is zero, the program prints "NO". This is also correct because a triangle with zero area cannot exist.

3. **Finding Points for Non-Zero Area**:
   - The program attempts to find points that satisfy the conditions for a non-zero area. However, the logic used to find these points is flawed.

   Specifically, the logic used to determine the points is as follows:
   - If \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\), it prints "0 1".
   - If \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) but \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\), it prints "1 0".
   - Otherwise, it prints "0" followed by \(m // 2\).

   Let's analyze these cases:
   - **Case 1**: If \(2 \times \text{area} \leq n\), the chosen points are \((0, 0)\), \((2 \times \text{area}, 1)\), and \((0, 1)\). The area of this triangle would be:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times \text{area} \times 1 = \text{area}
     \]
     This is not necessarily equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

   - **Case 2**: If \(2 \times \text{area} > n\) but \(2 \times \text{area} \leq m\), the chosen points are \((1, 0)\), \((1, 2 \times \text{area})\), and \((0, 0)\). The area of this triangle would be:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 2 \times \text{area} = \text{area}
     \]
     Again, this is not necessarily equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

   - **Case 3**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the chosen points are \((0, 0)\), \((0, m // 2)\), and \((n, m // 2)\). The area of this triangle would be:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times n \times m // 2 = \frac{nm}{4}
     \]
     This is not necessarily equal to \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

In all cases, the program does not guarantee that the chosen points form a triangle with the required area \(\frac{nm}{k}\). Therefore, the program is not always correct.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the points chosen indeed form a triangle with the required area \(\frac{nm}{k}\). One possible approach could involve using the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices and ensuring the chosen points satisfy this condition.
