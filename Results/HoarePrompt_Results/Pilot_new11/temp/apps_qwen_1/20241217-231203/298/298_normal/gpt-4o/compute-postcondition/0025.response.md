The function `func` accepts no parameters. The parameter constraints provided (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) do not apply directly to the function parameters but rather to variables within the function. The return value depends on the relationships and operations performed within the function based on these constraints.

Given the output information is missing, we can infer that the function might be returning a value based on the constraints provided, but without further details, we cannot specify the exact return values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept no parameters and return a value based on the given constraints for `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.**
