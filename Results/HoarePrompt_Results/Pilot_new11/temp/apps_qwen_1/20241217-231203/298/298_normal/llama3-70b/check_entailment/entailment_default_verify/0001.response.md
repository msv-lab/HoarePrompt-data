Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided functions do not address the main problem of finding three integer points that form a triangle with the specified area. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` seem to be related to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the extended Euclidean algorithm, but they are not used in the context of solving the given problem. The output hints confirm that `func_3` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as it does not involve calculating the required area of the triangle. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is incorrect.
