Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to handle cases where the substring between the first '[' and the last ']' does not contain any colons. In such cases, the code incorrectly prints -1 instead of correctly determining that the string cannot form an accordion.

Here is a specific case where the code fails:

**Input:**
```
|[a||]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
```

In this case, the code finds the first '[' at index 0 and the last ']' at index 6. The substring between them is "[a||]". The substring contains two colons at positions 2 and 3, but the code does not correctly handle this scenario and prints -1 instead of 4 (the length of the substring "[::]").

To fix this issue, the code should check if the substring between the first '[' and the last ']' contains at least one colon before proceeding with the rest of the logic.
