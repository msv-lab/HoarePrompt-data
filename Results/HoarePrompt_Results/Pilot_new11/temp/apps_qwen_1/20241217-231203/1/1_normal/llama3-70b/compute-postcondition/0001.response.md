`s` is the input string from the user, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with a length between 1 and 500000 inclusive. The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The original string `s` remains unchanged.

The impact of the code on the program is that it sets `n` to the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is the input string from the user, `n` is the length of `s`**
