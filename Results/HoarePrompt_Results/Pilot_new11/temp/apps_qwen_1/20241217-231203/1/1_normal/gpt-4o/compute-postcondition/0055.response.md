Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, and the range `[bind - 1, ind]` must contain valid indices. If the character at index `i` is `:`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
