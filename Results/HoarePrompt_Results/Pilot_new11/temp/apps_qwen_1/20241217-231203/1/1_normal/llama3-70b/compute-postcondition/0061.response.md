Postcondition: **`n` is the length of the input string `s`, `f` is `True`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is `-1`. `bind` is the last index `i` where `s[i]` is `':'` and `f` is `True`. `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`.**
