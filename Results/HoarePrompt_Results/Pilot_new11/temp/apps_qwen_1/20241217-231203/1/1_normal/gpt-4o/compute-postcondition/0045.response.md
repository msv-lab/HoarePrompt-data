Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`.
   - `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ind` is not -1 and less than `bind`.
   - `start_colon` is 0 (since `s[i]` is not `:` at the start).

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(ind + 1, bind)` will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1`.

3. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and the loop has just started, meaning it hasn't incremented `i` yet.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against the upper bound `bind`.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `1`.
   - `start_colon` remains 0 because the condition `s[i]` is `:` was not met in the previous iteration (since `i` was 0 and `s[0]` is not `:`).

6. **Conditions to Check**:
   - `ind` must still be not -1 and less than `bind`.
   - `i` must be within the range from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 1.
- `ind` is not -1 and less than `bind`.
- `start_colon` remains 0.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, `i` is 1, `ind` is not -1 and less than `bind`, `start_colon` is 0.**
