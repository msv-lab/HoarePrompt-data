The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
