`pipe_count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `ind` remains the same, `bind` remains the same, the range `[bind - (bind - ind), ind]` remains valid, `end_colon` remains the same, `start_colon` remains the same, `end_colon` remains the same, `start_colon` remains the same, `i` is now `start_colon + 3`, and `pipe_count` is increased by 1.
