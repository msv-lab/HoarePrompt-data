The variable `start_colon` is assigned the value `-1`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `i` is `-1`; `ind` is either not `-1` and less than `bind`, or both are `-1`; `start_colon` is `-1`.
