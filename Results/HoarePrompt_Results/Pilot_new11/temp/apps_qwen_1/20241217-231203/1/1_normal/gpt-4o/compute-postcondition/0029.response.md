The code `break` does not affect any variables and simply breaks out of the current loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement currently active, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is -1, `i` is -1**
