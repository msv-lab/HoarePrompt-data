Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, and the range `[bind - (bind - ind), ind]` must contain valid indices; `end_colon` is the index of the last `:` encountered within the range `[ind + 1, bind]` or `end_colon` remains -1 if no `:` is found. The condition `(start_colon == -1 or end_colon == -1 or start_colon >= end_colon)` is true.***
