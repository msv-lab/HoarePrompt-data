Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `f` is True, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` character after the first `['` if such a `['` exists; otherwise, `ind` is -1. `bind` is `n - 2`, and we either break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement we were inside, or `bind` remains as `n - 2` and `ind` does not change.***
