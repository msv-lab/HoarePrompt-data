Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s`, `i` is 1, `ind` is not -1 and less than `bind`. If `s[i]` equals `':'`, then `start_colon` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` does not equal `':'`, no changes occur to `start_colon` and the program continues as normal.***
