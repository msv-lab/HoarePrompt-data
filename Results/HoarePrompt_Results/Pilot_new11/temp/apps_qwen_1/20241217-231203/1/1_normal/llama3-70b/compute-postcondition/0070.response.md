`ans` is incremented by 1. Since the current character `s[i]` is not specified, we cannot determine if the condition to increment `ans` is met. However, `ans` is definitely incremented by 1 regardless of the character `s[i]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`ind` is an integer such that `ind <= bind`, `s` is a string, `i` is `ind + 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.**
