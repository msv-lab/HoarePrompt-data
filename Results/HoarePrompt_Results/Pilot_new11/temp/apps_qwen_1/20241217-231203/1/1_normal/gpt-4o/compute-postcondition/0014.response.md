The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional statement. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is in, but it does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `i`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is `i + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
