Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is `0`, `i` is `-1`. If `s[i]` is `']'`, then the function does not change `s`, `n`, `ind`, `bind`, or `i`. Since there is no else part, the state remains as specified in the if part.***
