The code sets `bind` to `-1`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `f`, or `ind`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the input string `s`, `f` is a boolean indicating whether a '[' character was found, `ind` is the index of the first ':' character that occurs after the first '[' character if such a '[' exists, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is -1.**
