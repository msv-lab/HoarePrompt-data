The code `break` does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the loop or the most nested loop or conditional statement. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `s[i+1]` is checked; `f` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration; `ind` is set to `i`; we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
