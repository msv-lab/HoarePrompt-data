Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s[i+1]` will be checked, `f` retains its value from the previous iteration, and if `f` is true, `ind` is equal to `i` and the most internal loop or block structure is broken. If `f` is false, `ind` remains set accordingly based on the next iteration's outcome.***
