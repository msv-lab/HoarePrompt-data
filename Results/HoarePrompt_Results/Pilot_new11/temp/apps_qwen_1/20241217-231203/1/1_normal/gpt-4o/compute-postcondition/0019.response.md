Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of the character `[` in `s`, or remains `-1` if no such character is found; `bind` is `-1`, `i` starts from `n-1` and goes down to `0`. The current value of `s[i]` is `]`.***
