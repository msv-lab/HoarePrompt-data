Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is `b`
   - `b` is 0

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop condition is `while b:`

3. **Current Value of `b`**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 0.

4. **Determining the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero (i.e., `b` must be true in a boolean context).
   - Since `b` is currently 0, it cannot satisfy the condition `while b:`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - To make the loop execute one more time, `b` needs to be set to a non-zero value.
   - Additionally, since `a` is equal to `b`, `a` should also be adjusted to match this new non-zero value of `b`.

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust both `a` and `b` to a non-zero value. We can choose any non-zero value for `b`, but for simplicity, let's assume `b` is set to 1 (the smallest positive integer).

**Final State**:
- `a` is 1
- `b` is 1

State: **`a` is 1, `b` is 1**
