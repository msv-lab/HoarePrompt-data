The function `func_2(a, b)` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers between 1 and \(10^9\). It calculates the product of `a` and `b`, divides this product by the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`, and returns the integer division of the result. The function does not handle cases where `func_1(a, b)` might return zero or negative values, which would lead to a division by zero error or non-integer results.
