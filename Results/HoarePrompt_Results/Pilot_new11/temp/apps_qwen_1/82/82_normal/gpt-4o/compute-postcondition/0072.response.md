Postcondition: ***`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`; `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found so far; `min_k` is the smallest value of `k` that achieves `min_lcm`. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
