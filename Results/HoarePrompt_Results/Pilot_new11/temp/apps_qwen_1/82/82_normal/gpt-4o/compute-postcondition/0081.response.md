Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are integers, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, and `k` is the final value of `k`. If `diff % k == 0`, then `new_a` and `new_b` are computed after the loop, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` when `min_lcm` is achieved, and `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found during the loop. If `diff % k != 0`, no specific changes are made to the variables.**
