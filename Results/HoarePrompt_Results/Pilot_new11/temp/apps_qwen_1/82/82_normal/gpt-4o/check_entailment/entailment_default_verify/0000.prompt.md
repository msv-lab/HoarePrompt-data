You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)

#Function 3:
def func_3(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    diff = abs(a - b)
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k):
                    min_lcm = current_lcm
                    min_k = candidate
    return min_k


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are already equal. According to the problem description, if \(a = b\), the answer should be \(0\). However, the program checks if \(a == b\) but does not handle this special case properly. 

Let's walk through the example given in the problem:

For the input:
```
5 10
```

The program will execute as follows:
- Since \(a \neq b\), it enters the loop to find the optimal \(k\).
- The difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is \(5\).
- It iterates over \(k\) from \(1\) to \(2\) (since \(\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236\)).
- For \(k = 1\), \(new_a = (5 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 5\) and \(new_b = (10 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 10\). The LCM is \(50\).
- For \(k = 5\), \(new_a = (5 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5\) and \(new_b = (10 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10\). The LCM is still \(50\).

Since the program does not explicitly handle the case where \(a == b\), it returns \(0\) as the smallest \(k\), which is correct in this specific case. However, the issue arises with inputs like:
```
8 12
```

Here, \(a = 8\) and \(b = 12\), so the difference is \(4\). The optimal \(k\) should be \(0\) since \(LCM(8+0, 12+0) = LCM(8, 12) = 24\), which is the smallest possible LCM. However, the program will not return \(0\) because it will find other candidates like \(k = 2\) or \(k = 4\).

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, both within the range \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and ensures \(a \neq b\). It first checks if `a` equals `b`, returning 0 if true. Otherwise, it calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`. It then iterates through possible values of `k` from 1 to the square root of `diff`, checking each pair of factors of `diff`. For each factor pair, it adjusts `a` and `b` to the nearest multiples of `k` and computes their least common multiple using `func_2`. It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding `k` that achieves this minimum LCM. Finally, it returns either 0 (if no valid `k` was found) or the `k` that results in the smallest LCM found.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
