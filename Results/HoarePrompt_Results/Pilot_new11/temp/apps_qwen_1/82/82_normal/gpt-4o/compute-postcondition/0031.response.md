Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\). `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\) and is at least 1. `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple (LCM) found during the iteration, initialized to infinity. `min_k` is the corresponding minimum k that achieves this LCM, initialized to 0. If `diff % k == 0` for any \(k\) from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{diff} \rfloor + 1\), the LCM of `a` and `b` using this \(k\) is calculated and compared with `min_lcm`. If the new LCM is smaller, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated. After the loop, `min_lcm` and `min_k` reflect the smallest LCM and the corresponding \(k\) that achieves this LCM within the specified range.***
