The code sets `min_k` to the value of `candidate`. This updates the value of `min_k` but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `min_k`.

Output State: **`a` is `(a + new_candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `new_b` is `(b + new_candidate + candidate - 2) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` is `candidate`**
