To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the condition of the `while` loop.

### Given Information:
- `visited[0]` is `True`
- `cycle` is `[0, p[0] - 1]`
- `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `not visited[x]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - The loop will check the condition `not visited[x]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `visited[x]` must be `False`.

2. **Current Values**:
   - `visited[0]` is `True`.
   - `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - Since `visited[0]` is `True`, we need to ensure that `visited[x]` is `False` for the loop to continue.
   - We don't have direct information about `visited[x]`, but we know `x` is derived from the value of `p[p[0] - 1]`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `visited[x]` must be `False`. However, we don't have enough information to directly modify `visited[x]`. Instead, we need to ensure that `x` is such that `visited[x]` is `False`.

Since the current value of `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and we need `visited[x]` to be `False`, we can only adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

### Adjusted State:
- `visited[0]` remains `True`.
- `cycle` remains `[0, p[0] - 1]`.
- `x` is still `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, but we need to ensure `visited[x]` is `False`.

Thus, the required adjustment is to ensure that `visited[x]` is `False`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`visited[0]` is True, `cycle` is [0, p[0] - 1], `x` is p[p[0] - 1] - 1, and `visited[x]` must be False**
