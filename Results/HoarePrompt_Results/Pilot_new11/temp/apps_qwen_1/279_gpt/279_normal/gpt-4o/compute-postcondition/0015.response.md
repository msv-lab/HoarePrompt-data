Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `visited[0]` is True
   - `cycle` is `[0]`
   - `x` is `p[0] - 1`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `not visited[x]`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `visited[x]` is False.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we focus on the condition itself.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `visited[x]` must be False at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Currently, `visited[0]` is True.
   - This implies that `x` is set to `p[0] - 1`, and `visited[x]` should be checked in the next iteration.

6. **Next Iteration Requirement**:
   - For the loop to continue, `visited[x]` must be False.
   - Given `x` is `p[0] - 1`, we need to ensure that `visited[p[0] - 1]` is False in the next iteration.

7. **State Adjustment**:
   - We need to adjust the state so that `visited[p[0] - 1]` is False.

**Final State**:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `visited[0]` is True.
- `cycle` is `[0]`.
- `x` is `p[0] - 1`, but in the next iteration, `visited[x]` must be False.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `visited[p[0] - 1]` must be False**.
