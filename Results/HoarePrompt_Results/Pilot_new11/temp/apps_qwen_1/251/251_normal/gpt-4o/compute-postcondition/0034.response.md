Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is greater than 0
   - `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`
   - `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` in the range 0 to `i-1` where `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`.
   - For each `j` in this range, the loop body updates `dp[i]`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be incremented by 1 because the loop condition is `j < i`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The new value of `i` will be greater than 1 (since it was greater than 0 initially and is now incremented by 1).
   - `j` will range from 0 to `(i-1)` in the next iteration.

5. **State Update:**
   - `total` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `j` must range from 0 to `i-1` in the next iteration.
   - `dp[i]` will be updated similarly as per the loop body, but we only need to know the range of `j` for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is greater than 1, `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`**
