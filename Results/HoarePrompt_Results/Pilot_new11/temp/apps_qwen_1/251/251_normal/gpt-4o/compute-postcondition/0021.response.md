According to the given code, the loop is iterating over the range from 0 to `i-1`. The loop body sets `dp[i]` based on the comparison between `volumes[j]` and `volumes[i]`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `total` is 0
- `i` is at least 1 (let's denote it as `i_end_prev`)
- `j` is 0 (since it was the last value at the end of the previous iteration)

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value, which would be 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the loop is still within its range.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `total` is still 0
- `i` is still at least 1 (denoted as `i_end_prev` or simply `i`)
- `j` is now 1

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
