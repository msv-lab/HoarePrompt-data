#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of simple cakes, and cakes is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers (r_i, h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples `(r_i, h_i)`, `volumes` is a list of volumes calculated as \( \pi \times r_i^2 \times h_i \) for each cake, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value between its original value (which is `volumes[i]`) and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` in the range 0 to `i-1` where `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the original volume of the cakes and the cumulative volumes under the given conditions stored in the dp list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `cakes` containing tuples of the form `(r_i, h_i)`, where `r_i` and `h_i` represent the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively. It calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi \times r_i^2 \times h_i \) and stores these volumes in a list called `volumes`. It then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum value between the original volume of each cake and the cumulative volumes under the condition that the volume of a previous cake must be less than the current cake's volume. This maximum value is stored in a list called `dp`. Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` list. Potential edge cases include when the list `cakes` is empty or when all cakes have the same volume, leading to the original volumes being the maximum values in the `dp` list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, and cakes is a list of tuples, where each tuple (r_i, h_i) represents the radius and height of the i-th cake such that 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10 000.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but reads two inputs from the standard input: the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of cakes, and the second input is a space-separated list of integers representing the radii and heights of the cakes. It then processes this data to call another function `func_1` with the values of `n` and the list of cakes, and prints the result formatted to six decimal places. If the input values are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10,000), the function will correctly compute and print the result. However, if the input values are outside these ranges, the function will still process them, but the results may not be meaningful. There are no explicit checks to validate the input constraints within the given code.
