The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of simple cakes, and `cakes`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (r_i, h_i) representing the radius and height of the i-th cake respectively. The function returns the maximum value between the original volume of the cakes and the cumulative volumes under the given conditions stored in the dp list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `cakes` of tuples. Each tuple in `cakes` contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. The function returns the maximum value between the original volume of the cakes and the cumulative volumes under the given conditions stored in the dp list.**
