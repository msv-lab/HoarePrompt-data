Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is greater than 1, `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` in the range 0 to `i-1` with `j` being 1. Specifically, if `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. Since there is no else part, the update rule only applies when `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`.***
