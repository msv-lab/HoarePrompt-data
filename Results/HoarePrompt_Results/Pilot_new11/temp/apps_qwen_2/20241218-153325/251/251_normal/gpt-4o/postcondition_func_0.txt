The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `cakes` containing tuples of the form `(r_i, h_i)`, where `r_i` and `h_i` represent the radius and height of the i-th cake, respectively. It calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi \times r_i^2 \times h_i \) and stores these volumes in a list called `volumes`. It then uses dynamic programming to find the maximum value between the original volume of each cake and the cumulative volumes under the condition that the volume of a previous cake must be less than the current cake's volume. This maximum value is stored in a list called `dp`. Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` list. Potential edge cases include when the list `cakes` is empty or when all cakes have the same volume, leading to the original volumes being the maximum values in the `dp` list.
