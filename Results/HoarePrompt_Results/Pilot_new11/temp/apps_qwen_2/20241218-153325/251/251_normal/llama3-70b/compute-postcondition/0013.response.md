The code initializes a list `dp` with `n` zeros. This means that the first `n` elements of the list `dp` are set to 0.0, but the original list `cakes` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple contains three elements where the first element is the volume of the cake \(\pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h\) in descending order, the second element is `r`, and the third element is `h`; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.**
