The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to be described based on the given constraints and output cases.

Since there are no parameters mentioned in the function definition `def func_1():`, we need to focus on the constraints and the possible outputs.

Given constraints:
- `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h.

There are no parameters listed in the function signature, so the function does not accept any parameters. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to be determined without any input parameters, based on the constraints provided for `h` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is based on the constraints that `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h.**
