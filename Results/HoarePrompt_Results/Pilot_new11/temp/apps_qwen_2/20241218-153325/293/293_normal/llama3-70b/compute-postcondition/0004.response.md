`ans` is incremented by the value of `n // 2 - 1`. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` is an integer. Let's denote the value of `n` as `N`. Thus, `ans` becomes `ans + (N // 2 - 1)`. Given that `ans` was initially `0`, the new value of `ans` is `N // 2 - 1`. The values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2^`h` and the current value of n is even; `ans` is `n // 2 - 1`**
