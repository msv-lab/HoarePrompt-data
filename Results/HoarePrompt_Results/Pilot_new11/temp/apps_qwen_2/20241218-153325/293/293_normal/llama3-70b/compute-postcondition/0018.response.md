The code snippet `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Given the initial state where `n` is 2, the value of `n` will be updated to 1 after the operation.

- The initial state: `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is 2. If `n % 2 == 0`, `ans` remains the same. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus 1.
- After executing `n //= 2`, `n` is now 1.
- Since `n` is now 1 (which is odd), `ans` will be updated to its previous value plus 1. However, the initial value of `ans` is not specified, but we know from the condition that if `n % 2 == 0`, `ans` remains the same. Since `n` was 2 (even) initially, `ans` would remain unchanged in the first condition, making the new value of `ans` equal to 1 (since 2 % 2 == 0 and no change occurred, and then 1 % 2 != 0, so ans is incremented by 1).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, `n` is 1, `ans` is 1**
