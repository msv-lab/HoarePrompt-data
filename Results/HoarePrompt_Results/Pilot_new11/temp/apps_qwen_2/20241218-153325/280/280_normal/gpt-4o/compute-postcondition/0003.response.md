`speeds` is a list with `a` elements, all initially set to 0. The first element of the list `speeds[0]` is assigned the value of `v1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `v1` ≤ 100; `v2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `v2` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ 10; `a` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `a` ≤ 100; `b` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `b` ≤ 10; `speeds` is a list with `a` elements, where the first element `speeds[0]` is equal to `v1` and all other elements are 0.**
