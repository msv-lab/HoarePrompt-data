The code snippet `max_length += max_speed` updates the value of `max_length` by adding `max_speed` to its current value. Let's break down the steps:

1. Initially, `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus `max_speed`.
2. After executing `max_length += max_speed`, `max_length` becomes the original value of `max_length` plus `max_speed` plus `max_speed`.

Therefore, the updated value of `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus twice `max_speed`.

Output State: **`min_speed` is \(\min(M + d, \text{max\_speed})\); `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus \(2 \times \text{max\_speed}\); `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed` is \(\max(\text{max\_speed} - d, M)\); `max_length`, `min_length` is `max_length + \min(M + d, \text{max\_speed})`; and `i` is 2.**
