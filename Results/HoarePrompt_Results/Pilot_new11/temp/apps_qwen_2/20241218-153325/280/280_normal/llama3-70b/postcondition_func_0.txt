The function `func()` accepts four parameters: `v1` and `v2` (both integers between 1 and 100), `t` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `d` (an integer between 0 and 10). It calculates two lengths, `max_length` and `min_length`, based on the speeds `max_speed` and `min_speed` which start as the maximum and minimum of `v1` and `v2`, respectively. Over the course of `t-1` iterations, `max_speed` decreases by `d` while `min_speed` increases by `d` until they meet. In each iteration, `max_length` and `min_length` are updated accordingly. Finally, the function prints the value of `max_length`.

If `d` is 0, the function simplifies the calculation and directly returns `v1 + v2`. Otherwise, it iterates through the process described above to compute the lengths.
