Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `v1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v1 \leq 100\)
- `v2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v2 \leq 100\)
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\)
- `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\)
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` minus `d` if it is greater than `min_speed`, otherwise it is `min_speed`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`
- `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max_speed`
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t + min_speed`
- `i` is `t - 1`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates from `i = t - 1` down to `i = 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must decrease by 1 from its current value.

### Current State:
- `i` is currently `t - 1`.

### Next Iteration:
- After the next iteration, `i` will be `t - 2`.

### Updated States:
- The other states (`v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`) remain unchanged since the loop body is omitted.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is `t - 2`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`v1` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v1 \leq 100\); `v2` is an integer such that \(1 \leq v2 \leq 100\); `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\); `d` is an integer such that \(0 \leq d \leq 10\); `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` minus `d` if it is greater than `min_speed`, otherwise it is `min_speed`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max_speed`; `min_length` is `min_speed * t + min_speed`; `i` is `t - 2`**
