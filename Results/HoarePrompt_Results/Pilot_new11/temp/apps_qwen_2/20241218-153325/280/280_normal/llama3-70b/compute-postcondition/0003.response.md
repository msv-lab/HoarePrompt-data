`min_speed` is assigned the value of `min(v1, v2)`. This means `min_speed` will take the smaller value between `v1` and `v2`. The `max_speed` remains unchanged as it was defined before the assignment of `min_speed`. The other variables (`t` and `d`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100; `v2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`.**
