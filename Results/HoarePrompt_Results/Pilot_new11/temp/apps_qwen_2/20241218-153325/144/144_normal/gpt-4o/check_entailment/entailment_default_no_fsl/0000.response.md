Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code calculates the Mex value based on the sorted list of integers, which does not necessarily maximize the Mex value after performing the allowed operations.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
Input
4
2 3 3 6
```

The code will sort the list to `[2, 3, 3, 6]` and calculate the Mex value as follows:
- After the first iteration (`num = 2`), `mex` remains `1`.
- After the second iteration (`num = 3`), `mex` becomes `2`.
- After the third iteration (`num = 3`), `mex` remains `2`.
- After the fourth iteration (`num = 6`), `mex` remains `2`.

Thus, the output will be `2`, but the maximum possible value of Mex can actually be `4` if we decrease the second element to `1` and the fourth element to `3`, resulting in the array `[2, 1, 3, 3]`.

Therefore, the code does not handle all cases correctly and hence is **Incorrect**.
