The code `print(mex)` simply prints the value of the variable `mex`, which is already determined before this line of code is executed. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. Therefore, the output of the print statement is just the value of `mex`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mex` is printed, and its value remains the same.**
