Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `a` from the input.
   - It ensures that `n` is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and each element in `a` is within the valid range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list `a`. Sorting helps in easily determining the maximum possible value of the Mex.

3. **Calculating Mex**:
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to 1, representing the smallest positive integer.
   - A for loop iterates through the sorted list `a`, and for each element `num`:
     - If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, it means that `mex` is already present in the array (or could be present if no operations are applied).
     - Therefore, `mex` is incremented by 1.
   - This process continues until the end of the list, ensuring that `mex` is the smallest integer that does not appear in the array.

4. **Output**:
   - The final value of `mex` is printed, which represents the maximum possible value of the Mex after applying the operations.

The program follows the problem description accurately because:
- It correctly calculates the maximum possible value of the Mex by considering the elements of the array after potentially applying the operations.
- It handles the constraints on the size of `n` and the values of `a_i` as specified.
- It outputs the correct result for any valid input according to the problem statement.

Thus, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
