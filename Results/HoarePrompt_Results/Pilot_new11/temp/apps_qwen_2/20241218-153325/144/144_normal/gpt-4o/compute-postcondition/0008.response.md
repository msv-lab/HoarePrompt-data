According to the given code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` and the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mex` is 2, and `mex` remains unchanged regardless of the value of `num`.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `mex` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the list `a` must be processed. Therefore, `num` will be set to the next element in the list `a`, and since the list is sorted and all values are between 1 and \(10^9\), the value of `mex` will remain 2 unless the current value of `num` is less than 1, which is not possible based on the given constraints.

State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mex` is 2, and `num` is the next element in the list `a`**
