Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array of integers from standard input. This part matches the problem description perfectly.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array. Sorting helps in efficiently determining the mex (minimum excluded value).

3. **Calculating the Mex**: 
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to 1, which is the smallest positive integer.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array and checks if the current element `num` equals `mex`. If they are equal, `mex` is incremented.
   - If `num` is greater than `mex`, the loop breaks because the mex cannot be greater than the current element.
   - This ensures that the mex is the smallest positive integer not present in the array.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated mex to standard output.

The program handles the following edge cases correctly:
- If the array contains all integers from 1 to \( n \), the mex will be \( n + 1 \).
- The program correctly increments `mex` when necessary and stops early when a number in the array is found to be greater than the current `mex`.

Given these points, the program always performs as expected according to the problem description, making it correct.
