Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible value of the mex. The logic in the program assumes that Alyona can only decrease elements but not increase them, which is correct. However, the program increments `mex` whenever `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`. This approach does not always yield the correct result.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 2 2 2
```

The program would output `5`, but the correct output should be `3`. Hereâ€™s why:

- After sorting, the array is `[2, 2, 2, 2]`.
- Initially, `mex` is `1`.
- The first element `2` is greater than or equal to `1`, so `mex` is incremented to `2`.
- The second element `2` is also greater than or equal to `2`, so `mex` is incremented to `3`.
- The third and fourth elements are also `2`, but since `mex` is already `3`, they do not affect `mex`.

Thus, the program does not handle the case where multiple elements can be decreased to the same value, potentially missing the optimal mex value. The correct approach should consider the possibility of setting each element to the smallest possible value without exceeding its original value, which might allow reaching higher mex values.
