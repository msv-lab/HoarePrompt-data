Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code sorts the array and then iterates through it to find the maximum possible value of the Mexican Hat (mex). However, sorting the array does not guarantee that the mex will be maximized. The code fails to consider that Alyona can decrease any element to any positive integer value, not just values present in the original array.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 3 3 3 6
```
The code sorts the array to `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]` and then iterates through it. It finds that the mex is `2` because the next available number that is not in the sorted array is `2`. However, Alyona can decrease the `6` to `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. In this case, the mex would be `4`.

Another example:
```
2
2 1
```
The code outputs `3`, but Alyona can decrease the `2` to `1`, resulting in the array `[1, 1]`. The mex would be `2`.

Therefore, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases and does not maximize the mex value as required by the problem description.
