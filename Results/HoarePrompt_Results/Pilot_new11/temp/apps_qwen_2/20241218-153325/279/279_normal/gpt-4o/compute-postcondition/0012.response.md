`visited[x]` is assigned the value `True`. Since `x` is 0, `visited[0]` is set to `True`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `visited[0]` is True; `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 0**
