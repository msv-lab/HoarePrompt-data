Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of changes needed for Pavel to ensure each skewer visits all 2n placements. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the correct transformation required to achieve the goal.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
0
```

This happens because the program incorrectly calculates the number of components without reverse operations and does not account for the necessary transformations properly. The correct approach would involve ensuring each cycle in the permutation is properly reversed to cover all 2n placements, which this program fails to do.

A correct solution would involve more complex logic to determine the minimum number of changes required, including potentially breaking cycles and reversing them as needed.
