The code `b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))` creates a new list `b` by converting the elements in the slice of `data` starting from index `n + 1` to `2 * n + 1` into integers. The original lists `p` and `data` remain unchanged. The variable `b` is updated with these new integer values.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers converted from the slice of `data` starting from index 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of n integers consisting of the integers converted from the slice of `data` starting from index `n + 1` to `2 * n + 1`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`.**
