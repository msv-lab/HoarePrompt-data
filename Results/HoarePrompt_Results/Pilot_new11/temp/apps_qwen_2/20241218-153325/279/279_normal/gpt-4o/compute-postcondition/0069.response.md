The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, where each integer \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are unique.
- `b` is a list of `n` integers consisting of zeros and ones.

The output of the function is not explicitly given in the problem statement. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function likely processes these inputs to produce some form of output. The specific nature of the output would depend on the internal logic of the function, which is not provided here.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a permutation list `p`, and a binary list `b`, and return some unspecified result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a permutation list `p`, and a binary list `b`, and returns some unspecified result based on these inputs.**
