`min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is a factor of `diff`, and since `candidate` is assigned directly to `min_k`, `min_k` will also hold the value of `candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is `a + candidate - 1`, `b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `diff` is `diff`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `candidate` is a factor of `diff`, `new_b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` is `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` is `a + candidate - 1`, `b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `diff` is `diff`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `candidate` is a factor of `diff`, `new_b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` is `candidate`**
