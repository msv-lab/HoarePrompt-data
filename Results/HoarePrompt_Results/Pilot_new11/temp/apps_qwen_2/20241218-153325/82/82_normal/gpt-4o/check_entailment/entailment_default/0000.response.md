Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Let's break down the key parts:

1. **GCD Calculation (`func_1`)**: The function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known and correct method.

2. **LCM Calculation (`func_2`)**: The function calculates the LCM of two numbers using the relationship \( \text{lcm}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{gcd}(x, y)} \). Given that the GCD is correctly computed, the LCM calculation is also correct.

3. **Main Logic (`func_3`)**: The function correctly handles the case where \( a = b \) by returning 0. For \( a \neq b \), it calculates the absolute difference \( \text{diff} \) between \( a \) and \( b \). It then iterates over possible values of \( k \) from 1 to the square root of \( \text{diff} \), checking each pair of factors of \( \text{diff} \). For each factor pair, it adjusts \( a \) and \( b \) to the nearest multiples of \( k \) and computes their LCM using `func_2`. It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and the corresponding \( k \).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range. The hints provided in the output descriptions confirm that the functions are implemented correctly and align with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
