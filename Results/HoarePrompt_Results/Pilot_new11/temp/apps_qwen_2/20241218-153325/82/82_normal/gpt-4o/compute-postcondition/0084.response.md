The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\). The function returns either 0 or `min_k`, where `min_k` reflects the corresponding \(k\) that achieves the smallest LCM found during the loop.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return either 0 or the minimum \(k\) that results in the smallest LCM found during the execution of the function.
