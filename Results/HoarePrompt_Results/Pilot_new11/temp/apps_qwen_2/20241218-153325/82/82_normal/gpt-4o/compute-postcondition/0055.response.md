Output State: **`a` is the smallest multiple of `min_k` that is greater than or equal to `a + min_k - 1`, `b` is the smallest multiple of `min_k` that is greater than or equal to `b + min_k - 1`, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, `k` is the value of `min_k` when the loop exits, `candidate` is the last evaluated factor of `diff`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `min_k` that is greater than or equal to `b + min_k - 1`, `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found during the loop.**
