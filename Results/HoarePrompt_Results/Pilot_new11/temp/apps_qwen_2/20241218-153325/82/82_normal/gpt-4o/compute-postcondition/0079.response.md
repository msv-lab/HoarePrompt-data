Postcondition: ***`new_a` is \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
