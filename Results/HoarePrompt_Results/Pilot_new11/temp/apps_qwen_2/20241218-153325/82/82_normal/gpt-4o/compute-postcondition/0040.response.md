Postcondition: ***`a` is `a + candidate - 1`, `b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `diff` is `diff`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `candidate` is a factor of `diff`, `new_b` is `b + candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found so far. If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
