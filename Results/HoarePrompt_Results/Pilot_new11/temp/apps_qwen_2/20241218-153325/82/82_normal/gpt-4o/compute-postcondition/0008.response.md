To determine the necessary states before the loop executes, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given States:
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\)
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\)
- `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\) and must be at least 1
- `min_lcm` is infinity (though this doesn't directly affect the loop's execution)
- `min_k` is 0 (though this doesn't directly affect the loop's execution)
- The loop iterates from `k = 1` to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`
- The condition `diff % k == 0` must be true for the current value of `k`

### Loop Iteration:
The loop iterates over the candidate values `[k, diff // k]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from `k = 1` to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one valid `k` in the range `[1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1]` such that `diff % k == 0`.
   - This means `diff` must have at least one divisor within the specified range.

2. **Candidate Values**:
   - The candidates are `[k, diff // k]`.
   - Both `k` and `diff // k` must be integers, and they must satisfy the condition `diff % k == 0`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - Since `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, and \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) with \(a \neq b\), `diff` will always be a positive integer.
   - We need to ensure that there is at least one `k` in the range `[1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1]` such that `diff % k == 0`.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to guarantee that `diff` has at least one divisor in the range `[1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1]`.

Thus, the state adjustments needed are:
- `a` and `b` are such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\), \(1 \le b \le 10^9\), and \(a \neq b\).
- `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\) and must be at least 1.
- There must be at least one integer `k` in the range `[1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1]` such that `diff % k == 0`.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is an integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\), `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is the absolute value of \(a - b\) and must be at least 1, and there must be at least one integer `k` in the range `[1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1]` such that `diff % k == 0`**.
