`new_b` is assigned the value `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The value of `b` is unchanged, and `candidate` is an unknown value. The original value of `new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\). The states of `a`, `b`, `diff`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, `k` is a positive integer, and `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate**
