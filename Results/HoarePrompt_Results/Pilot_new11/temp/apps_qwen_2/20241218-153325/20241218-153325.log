DEBUG - description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.

Input
4

-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.

DEBUG - description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?
