The code `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. Given that `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), the new value of `x` will be between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive). The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), and `y` is a non-negative integer between 1 and `m` (inclusive)**
