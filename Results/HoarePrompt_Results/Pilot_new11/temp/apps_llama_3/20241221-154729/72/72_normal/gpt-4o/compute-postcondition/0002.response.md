The code decreases the value of `y` by 1. The initial value of `y` is a non-negative integer between 1 and `m` (inclusive). After the decrease, the new value of `y` will be between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive). 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), and `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive).
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), and `y` is a non-negative integer between 0 and `m-1` (inclusive)**
