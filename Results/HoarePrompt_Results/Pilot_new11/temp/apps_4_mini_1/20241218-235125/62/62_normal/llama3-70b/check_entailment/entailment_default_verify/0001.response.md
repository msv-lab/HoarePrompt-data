Final: **False**

The original assessment stated the correctness of the program as **True**, but upon closer examination, certain shortcomings of the implementation come to light based on the output hints provided. While the function `func_1` correctly calculates the base 10 representation of given digits, it does not account for validation of digits against the specified base. Specifically, the function does not check if all digits fall within the valid range [0, base-1]. 

For instance, if a digit equal to or greater than the specified base were to be provided, the program would incorrectly compute the base 10 value without raising any errors or handling the invalid input appropriately, leading to potentially misleading outputs. 

Due to this lack of input validation, it cannot be assured that the program behaves correctly for all potential valid input scenarios specified by the problem description. Thus, the assertion of correctness in the original assessment is not entirely justified, leading to the conclusion that the program is, in fact, not fully correct.
