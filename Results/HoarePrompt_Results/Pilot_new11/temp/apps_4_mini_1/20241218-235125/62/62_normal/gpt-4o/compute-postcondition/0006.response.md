The value of `decimal_value` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `decimal_value` multiplied by `base` plus `digit`. The value of `digit` is the third digit in the list `digits`, which means that `decimal_value` will now reflect the calculation based on its initial value, the value of `base`, and the specific `digit`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`digits` is a list of digits that must have at least 3 digits, `base` is an integer in the range [2, 40], `decimal_value` is equal to the previous value of `decimal_value` multiplied by `base` plus the third digit in `digits`, `digit` is the third digit in the list.**
