Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately captures the correctness of the program. The program correctly converts two numbers represented in different bases to their decimal equivalents using the `func_1` function, which effectively handles the conversion based on the provided annotations. 

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads and stores the number of digits and their respective bases correctly, aligning with the problem description.

2. **Base Conversion Logic**: The `func_1` function is annotated to clarify that it processes the list of digits and calculated the decimal value accurately. The state just before the return shows that `decimal_value` holds the correct decimal equivalent for each number, confirming the logic's validity for bases ranging from 2 to 40.

3. **Comparison**: Following the successful conversion, the program compares the two decimal values and prints the appropriate relational operator, which is consistent with the expected output as outlined in the problem description.

The annotations sufficiently support the functionality of the program, and there are no overlooked conditions or cases based on the problem constraints. Thus, the program meets all requirements, solidifying the original assessment as correct.
