To assess the impact of the code snippet provided, we start with the initial state:

- `digits` is a list of integers that must contain at least 2 integers.
- `base` is an integer where \(2 \leq \text{base} \leq 40\).
- `result` is equal to the second integer in the `digits` list.
- `digit` is also the second integer in the `digits` list.

The code executes the following operation:

```
result = result * base + digit
```

Step by step analysis:

1. The new value of `result` is calculated by taking the current value of `result`, multiplying it by `base`, and then adding `digit`.
2. Since both `result` and `digit` are derived from the `digits` list and `result` initially was the second integer, they both hold the same initial value.
3. Specifically, if we denote the second integer in `digits` as \(d\), then initially \(result = d\) and \(digit = d\).
4. Therefore, the updated value of `result` becomes \(result = d \times base + d\) or, simplifying, \(result = d \times (base + 1)\).

The values of `base`, `digits`, and `digit` remain unchanged. Only `result` is updated.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers containing at least 2 integers, `base` is an integer where 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `result` is equal to `second integer in digits * (base + 1)`, `digit` is the second integer in the list**.
