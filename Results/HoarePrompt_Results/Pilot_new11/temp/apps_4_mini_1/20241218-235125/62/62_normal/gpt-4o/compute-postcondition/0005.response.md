According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list contains at least 3 digits, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a non-empty list containing at least 2 integer digits. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `digits` list must contain at least 3 digits.

If the last executed digit was the second digit in the initial list (with an index of 1), in the next execution, the `digit` will be the third digit in the list (with an index of 2).

State: **`digits` is a list of digits that must have at least 3 digits, `base` is an integer in the range [2, 40], `decimal_value` is equal to the previous value of `decimal_value` multiplied by `base` plus `digit`, `digit` is the third digit in the list.**
