The original assessment concluded that the program is correct based on several points, stating that it correctly reads input, converts digits from their respective bases into decimal format, and performs the comparison accurately. Upon reviewing the program and the provided annotations, I find that the reasoning in the original assessment is sound.

The annotated version clarifies the behavior of the function `func_1`, detailing that the function successfully computes the integer value of a given list of digits in the specified base and returns this value. It also confirms that the input adheres to the constraints specified in the problem description, as it assumes valid input and does not account for potential errors such as invalid digits.

The annotations specify the state of variables and the expected behavior at different program points, indicating that conversion is managed properly and that the comparisons are made as intended.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid, and there are no other edge cases or exceptions raised in the discussed scenarios, the original assessment remains accurate. The program functions correctly according to the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
