Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle invalid inputs for the digit lists `x_digits` and `y_digits`. According to the problem, the digits must be within the range [0, base-1]. The function `func_1` calculates the value of the number based on the given digits and base but lacks checks to ensure all digits are valid. 

For example, if an input were:
```
1 2
2
1 3
0
```
Here, the digit '2' is not valid in base '2', which only allows '0' and '1'. The code would compute an integer for 'X' without raising an error, but it would be incorrect as per the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not account for this crucial aspect of input validation.
