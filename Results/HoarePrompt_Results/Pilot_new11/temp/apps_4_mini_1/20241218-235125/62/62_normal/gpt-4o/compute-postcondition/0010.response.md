Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `digits`, which represents the digits of a number, and an integer `base` within the range [2, 40]. It calculates and returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by the `digits` in the specified `base`. The function assumes that all digits in the list are non-negative and less than the base. It does not handle cases where the input digits contain invalid values (i.e., digits not less than the base) or cases where the inputs could be empty. After the function concludes, it returns `decimal_value`, which is the computed decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits`.**
