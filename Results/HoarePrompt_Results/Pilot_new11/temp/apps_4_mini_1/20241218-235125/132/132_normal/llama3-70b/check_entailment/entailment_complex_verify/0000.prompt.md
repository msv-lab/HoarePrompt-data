You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if sum(x) != sum(y):
        print('No')
    else:
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if x == y:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the given program based on the problem description:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We have two sequences of integers representing the number of stones in piles during two visits.
   - We need to determine if the transition from the first sequence (when stones were first counted) to the second sequence (after some stones may have been taken or moved) is possible.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program first checks if the sums of both sequences are equal. If not, prints "No".
   - If the sums are equal, it sorts both sequences and checks if they are equal. If they are equal after sorting, prints "Yes"; otherwise, prints "No".

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the case when all stones are either removed or moved but still result in the same sum. The program relies heavily on the equality of sorted lists after checking the sum.
   - Example:
     Let's take a sequence where it is possible to transform the first sequence into the second without them being equal after sorting. For instance:
     - Input:
       ```
       3
       5 5 5
       3 3 9
       ```
       Here, the total is the same (15), but the sorted lists will be different (`[5, 5, 5]` vs. `[3, 3, 9]`).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program fails in cases where stones can be taken in such a way that the total remains the same, but the individual counts in the piles cannot attain the second state by simple moves or removals.

Therefore, based on the reasoning above, the program does not correctly handle the described situation.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for cases where it is possible for the sum of stones to remain the same while the individual counts may not allow the transformation from `x` to `y` through valid operations.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, x is a list of n integers where each integer is within the range 0 <= x[i] <= 1000, and y is a list of n integers where each integer is within the range 0 <= y[i] <= 1000.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (sum(x) != sum(y)) :
        print('No')
    else :
        x.sort()
        y.sort()
        if (x == y) :
            print('Yes')
        else :
            print('No')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are sorted lists of `n` integers based on user input with their sums equal. If `x` is equal to `y`, then both lists are identical. Otherwise, `x` and `y` are distinct sorted lists of `n` integers but still have equal sums.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, and `y` is a list of `n` integers. If the sum of `x` is not equal to the sum of `y`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, if the sums are equal, `x` and `y` are sorted lists of `n` integers, and if `x` is equal to `y`, then both lists are identical. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then they are distinct sorted lists of `n` integers but still have equal sums.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters directly; instead, it takes user input to read an integer `n`, followed by two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` integers. If the sums of the lists `x` and `y` are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it proceeds to sort both lists. It then checks if the sorted lists `x` and `y` are identical. If they are, it prints 'Yes'; if not, it prints 'No'. After completion, the state of the program includes the input integer `n`, and two sorted lists `x` and `y`, provided both lists originally had equal sums. Edge cases where either `x` or `y` contains distinct values with the same sum are considered, and in such cases, 'No' will be printed, confirming the lists are not identical despite equal sums. The overall functionality does not return any values; it solely outputs result strings based on comparisons.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
