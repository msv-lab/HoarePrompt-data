The function accepts no parameters directly; instead, it takes user input to read an integer `n`, followed by two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` integers. If the sums of the lists `x` and `y` are not equal, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it proceeds to sort both lists. It then checks if the sorted lists `x` and `y` are identical. If they are, it prints 'Yes'; if not, it prints 'No'. After completion, the state of the program includes the input integer `n`, and two sorted lists `x` and `y`, provided both lists originally had equal sums. Edge cases where either `x` or `y` contains distinct values with the same sum are considered, and in such cases, 'No' will be printed, confirming the lists are not identical despite equal sums. The overall functionality does not return any values; it solely outputs result strings based on comparisons.
