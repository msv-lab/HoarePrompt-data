You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if total_y > total_x:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the recorded counts of stones in the piles are consistent. It only checks if the total number of stones after the second visit (`total_y`) is greater than the total number of stones after the first visit (`total_x`). If `total_y` is greater, it prints "No", which is correct in that case. However, it does not account for the scenario where the stones may have been moved between piles instead of being taken, and this can lead to a consistent count with a redistribution of stones.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
2 1 3 4 5
3 2 2 3 4
```

In this case, `total_x` is 15 and `total_y` is also 15. The stones can be moved among the piles so that the second sequence can be derived from the first by moving one stone from the first to the second pile, and one stone from the third to the fourth pile. The expected output should be "Yes", since redistribution is possible.

However, the program would output "Yes" in this scenario, which appears correct. To find a failing case, we need to consider cases where moving stones alone cannot satisfy the counts in `y`. 

If we take:
```
3
4 3 1
2 2 5
```

Here, `total_x` is 8 and `total_y` is also 8, but it is impossible to move stones to achieve the second array because there aren't enough stones in the first two piles to match the counts needed in the second array.

So a more rigorous test would find that the program only checks the total sums but fails to ensure that the distribution can be achieved given that jury members can only take stones. 

Hence, the code does not correctly verify all edge scenarios, making it incorrect, thus leading to: 

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of elements in two lists, `x` and `y`, from user input. It then reads the elements of these lists, both of which must contain `n` integers within specified bounds. The function calculates the sum of elements in both lists, `total_x` and `total_y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where the input format is incorrect (e.g., if the number of integers provided does not match `n`, or if non-integer values are given), nor does it provide any output or return value based on the user's input beyond the printed results. Therefore, the final state of the program includes the integer sums computed and the printed result based on their comparison.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
