The code provided executes a print statement. This does not modify any variable values, but it does output the string 'No'. Therefore, we need to include that in the output state, while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers as an input from the user; `y` is a new list of `n` integers satisfying `0 <= y_i <= 1000;` `total_x` is the sum of the integers in list `x`; `total_y` is the sum of the integers in list `y` and is greater than `total_x`; the output is 'No'.**
