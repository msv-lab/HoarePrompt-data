The variable `y` is assigned the value `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated string of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous state indicates `y` is a list of integers where each integer `y_i` satisfies `0 <= y_i <= 1000`. Now, since the new input for `y` replaces the previous list, `y` will consist of `n` new integers entered by the user, which will still satisfy `0 <= y_i <= 1000`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers as an input from the user; `y` is a new list of `n` integers that satisfies `0 <= y_i <= 1000`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50; `x` is a list of `n` integers as an input from the user; `y` is a new list of `n` integers satisfying `0 <= y_i <= 1000`.**
