The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `ans` remains unchanged initially, we only have to consider the incremented value of `ans`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` has been incremented by 1, `i` is 2**
