The variable `operations` is incremented by 1. The value of `operations` starts at 1, so after the increment, it becomes 2. All the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` of string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `operations` is 2, `i` is 1, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `i - 1` of string `s`.**
