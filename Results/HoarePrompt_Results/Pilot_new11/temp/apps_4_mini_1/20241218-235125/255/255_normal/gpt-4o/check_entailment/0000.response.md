Correctness: **False**. 

The program aims to count the number of operations needed to delete a string by counting transitions between different characters. However, this approach does not match the requirement of the problem statement. 

For example, consider the input case:
```
n = 6
s = "aaabbb"
```

According to the problem, we can delete the three 'a's in one operation and the three 'b's in another operation, which equals 2 operations in total. However, the provided program counts transitions between characters and would incorrectly return 3 as the output (1 for 'aaa', 1 for the transition to 'b', and 1 for the 'bbb'). 

Thus, there exists at least one case where the program does not meet the problem's requirements.
