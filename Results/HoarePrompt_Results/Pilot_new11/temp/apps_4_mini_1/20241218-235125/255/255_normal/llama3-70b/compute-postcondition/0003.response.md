According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `1`. The variable `ans` starts at `1`, which does not affect the loop's execution condition.

At the beginning of the last iteration, `i` would be `1` (the value when the loop starts executing). Since it starts from `1`, we need to ensure `i` reflects the first value when the loop executes.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**
