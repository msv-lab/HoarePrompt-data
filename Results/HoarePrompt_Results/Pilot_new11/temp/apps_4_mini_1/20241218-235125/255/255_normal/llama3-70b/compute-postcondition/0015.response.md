The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s`. The parameter `n` is constrained to be an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500, and the parameter `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The output of the function has not been specified in the provided information. Therefore, the exact functionality cannot be determined without additional details on the expected return value. However, based on the constraints, we can summarize the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 <= n <= 500) and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
