The `exit()` command is called, which terminates the program. As a result, there are no changes made to any variable values, and the current state will remain unchanged except that the program execution ends. Therefore, the Output State will reflect that the execution has ended, while retaining the previous variable states.

Output State: **`n` is at least `2592590`, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `c` is `(n - 2469046) // 1234`, and 'YES' has been printed.**
