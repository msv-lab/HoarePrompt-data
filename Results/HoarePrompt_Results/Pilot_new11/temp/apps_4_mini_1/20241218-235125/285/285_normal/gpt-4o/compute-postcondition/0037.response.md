To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the constraints and the structure of the for loop provided. 

The loop iterates over the range determined by `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. For this loop to execute, the expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` must evaluate to a non-negative integer, which implies the following:

1. **`remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0.** 
   - Since `remaining_after_houses` is defined as `n - a * house_cost`, we need to ensure `n` is at least `a * house_cost`, thus ensuring `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative.
   
2. **`car_cost` must be greater than 0.**
   - Dividing by `car_cost` (in the expression `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`) requires `car_cost` to be a positive value to avoid division by zero.

3. **`b` starts from 0 and will iterate up to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.**
   - This indicates the loop will be capable of starting and that the end condition is also non-negative, driven by how `remaining_after_houses` relates to `car_cost`.

4. **Ensuring `b` starts from 0 and has valid iterations means ensuring `remaining_after_houses // car_cost` is zero or greater.**

In conclusion, necessary states for the loop to execute would be:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to `a * house_cost` (ensures `remaining_after_houses` is non-negative).
- `car_cost` must be greater than 0 (ensures valid division).
- After adjusting these conditions, `b` would initialize to 0.

Given these considerations, here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, which must be greater than or equal to 0; `b` is now 0; `car_cost` must be greater than 0**
