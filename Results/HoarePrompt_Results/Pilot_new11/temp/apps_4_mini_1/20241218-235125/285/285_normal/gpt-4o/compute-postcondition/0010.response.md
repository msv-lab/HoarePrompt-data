To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current values of the variables and how they interact with the loop conditions.

1. The loop iterates over `b` in the range from `0` to `(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1)`.
2. `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`, which is greater than or equal to 1234567.
3. The maximum value for `b`, at the end of the last iteration, was `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, so `b` needs to be incremented for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need `b` to be less than or equal to `(remaining_after_houses // car_cost)`. Thus, after the last iteration with `b`, `b` must be incremented by 1 to allow the next iteration.

4. We also need to ensure the values for `remaining_after_cars` remain valid by maintaining that `remaining_after_cars` is still equal to `n - b * car_cost` and is not divisible by `computer_cost`.

Considering these points:

- If `b` was `0` during the last iteration, it will be `1` for the next iteration.
- After incrementing `b`, we need to check that `remaining_after_cars` should still satisfy its conditions.

Thus, at the beginning of the next iteration, the updated values are:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567; `car_cost` is greater than 0; `a` is 0; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n`; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `n - (b + 1) * car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.**
