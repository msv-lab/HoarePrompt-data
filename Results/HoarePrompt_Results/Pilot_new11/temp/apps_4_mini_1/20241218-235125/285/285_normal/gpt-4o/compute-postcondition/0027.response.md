The variable `remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses` minus `b` times `car_cost`. Given that `b` is 1, the calculation simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - car_cost`. The previous condition indicates that `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, which means that `remaining_after_cars` will be non-negative. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to `car_cost`, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`**.
