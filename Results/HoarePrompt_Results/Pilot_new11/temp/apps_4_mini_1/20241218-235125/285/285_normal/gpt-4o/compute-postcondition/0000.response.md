The value of `house_cost` is assigned to the constant 1234567. The initial state defines `n` as a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^9\), but this value is not affected by the code execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `house_cost` is 1234567.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `house_cost` is 1234567**
