You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.

Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).

Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?

Please help Kolya answer this question.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — Kolya's initial game-coin score.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only houses, cars and computers. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1359257

Output
YES
Input
17851817

Output
NO


-----Note-----

In the first sample, one of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer, spending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.
Program:
```
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1(n)` and consider potential edge cases that may not be handled correctly.

The function aims to determine if it's possible to express a given integer `n` as a sum of non-negative integer multiples of the costs of houses (1,234,567 coins), cars (123,456 coins), and computers (1,234 coins). The function iterates through all possibilities of how many houses can be bought (denoted by `a`), then within that loop, it iterates through possibilities of how many cars can be bought (denoted by `b`), and finally checks if the remaining coins can be completely spent on computers.

Key considerations:

1. **Large Input Values:** We must check whether the function correctly handles the maximum input value of `n`, which is \(10^9\). 

2. **Combinations of Purchases:** We should also consider if the algorithm will correctly identify when there are valid combinations of purchases that sum exactly to `n`.

3. **Edge Cases:** These include very small values of `n`, such as 1, 2, or 1233, which should return 'NO' as they cannot be formed with the given costs.

### Potential Case that Negates Correctness:

If `n = 1233`:
- The optimal approach to understand the output for this value is that:
    - The only item available for purchase is the computer, which costs 1,234 coins.
    - Since 1,233 is less than 1,234, there is no way to buy even one computer. 
- The function should correctly return 'NO' in this case.

Since this case exists where the change of `n` does not lead to the expected results described in the initial problem statement, and the program fails to correctly identify that `n=1233` cannot be formed with the given costs, bad implementation of boundary values indicates that:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to produce the correct output for at least one valid case (n=1233).

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost` for the last value of `a` calculated; `remaining_after_cars` is less than `car_cost` for the last value of `b` calculated, indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought, the remaining amount is not sufficient to buy even a single computer. If 'YES' was not returned during execution, it means that for all combinations of `a` (houses) and `b` (cars) checked, the remaining after cars was never divisible by `computer_cost`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that after maximizing the number of cars that can be bought with the remaining amount from 'n', the remaining amount was never divisible by 'computer_cost'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
