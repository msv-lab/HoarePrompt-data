The code calculates the value of `remaining_after_cars` based on the existing values of `remaining_after_houses`, `b`, and `car_cost`. Since `b` is 0, the term `b * car_cost` will be 0, resulting in:

```
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 0
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses
```

Therefore, `remaining_after_cars` will simply hold the same value as `remaining_after_houses`.

No other variables are affected by this calculation. The preconditions that remain valid after the execution include:

- `n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`
- `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to 0
- `b` is 0

With the above considerations concluded, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost`, `remaining_after_houses` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`**.
