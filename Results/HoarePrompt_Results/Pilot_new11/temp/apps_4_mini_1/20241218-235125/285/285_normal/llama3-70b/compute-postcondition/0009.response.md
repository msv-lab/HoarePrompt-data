In the given code, `c` is assigned the value of `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. We need to evaluate the effects of this calculation based on the initial states of the variables.

1. `a` is initially `0`, and `b` is initially `1`.
2. The expression simplifies to `c = (n - 0 * 1234567 - 1 * 123456) // 1234` which is `c = (n - 123456) // 1234`.
3. Given that `n` is a positive integer and must be at least `123456`, the term `n - 123456` will be non-negative.
4. Therefore, `c` will be equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234`, which is an integer calculation.

Thus, `c` is changed to the computed value based on the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least 123456; `a` is 0; `b` is 1; `c` is equal to `(n - 123456) // 1234`.**
