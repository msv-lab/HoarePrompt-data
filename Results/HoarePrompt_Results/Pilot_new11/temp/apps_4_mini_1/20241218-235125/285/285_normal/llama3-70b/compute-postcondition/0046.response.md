The `print` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console, but it does not change the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least `2 * 1234567`, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `c` is now equal to `(n - 2 * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`, and the condition `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 == n` still holds true.**
