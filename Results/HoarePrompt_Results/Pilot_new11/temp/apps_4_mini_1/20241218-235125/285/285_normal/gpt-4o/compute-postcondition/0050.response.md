Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`, which is greater than or equal to 0; `b` is now the maximum value of `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`, `car_cost` is greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`, and whether `remaining_after_cars` is divisible or not divisible by `computer_cost` determines if 'YES' is returned at some point during the loop. If the loop doesn't execute, `b` remains 0, with `remaining_after_cars` equal to `remaining_after_houses`.**
