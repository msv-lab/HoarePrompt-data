Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `house_cost * (previous a + 1)`; `remaining_after_houses` is equal to `n - a * house_cost`; `b` is now 2; `car_cost` is greater than 0; `remaining_after_cars` is now equal to `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`, and if `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES'.***
