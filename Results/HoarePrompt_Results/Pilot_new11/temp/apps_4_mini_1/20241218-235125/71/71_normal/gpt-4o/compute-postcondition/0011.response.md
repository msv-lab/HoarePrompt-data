Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, if the last digit of `n` is '0', then `count_zeros` is set to 1 and `to_remove` remains 0, otherwise `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is set to 1. The value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
