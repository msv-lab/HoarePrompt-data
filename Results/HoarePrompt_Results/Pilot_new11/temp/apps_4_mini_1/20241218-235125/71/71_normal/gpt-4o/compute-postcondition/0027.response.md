The `print(to_remove)` statement outputs the current value of `to_remove`, but it does not change the state of any variables. As such, the variables remain the same as before the print statement was executed. The value of `to_remove` is printed and that is the only direct output from this statement. 

Since `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, which is explicitly stated in the initial conditions, we conclude that `to_remove` is still determined by its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `count_zeros` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `n`, `to_remove` is equal to the number of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` trailing zeros, `k` is a positive integer, and the current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`, and the value of `to_remove` has been printed.**
