The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` may or may not have been increased by 1, and `to_remove` may or may not have been increased by 1 depending on the value of `digit`. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` may have increased by 1, `to_remove` may have increased by 1**.
