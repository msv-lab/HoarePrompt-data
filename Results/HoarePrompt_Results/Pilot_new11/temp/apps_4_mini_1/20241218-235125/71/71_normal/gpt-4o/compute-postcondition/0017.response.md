The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is updated based on the previous logic, and `to_remove` is updated based on the previous logic. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `count_zeros` is updated based on the previous logic, and `to_remove` is updated based on the previous logic, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
