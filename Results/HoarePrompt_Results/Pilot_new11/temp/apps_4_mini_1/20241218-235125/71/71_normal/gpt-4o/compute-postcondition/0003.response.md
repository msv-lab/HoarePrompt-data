The variable `to_remove` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9), `count_zeros` is 0, and `to_remove` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 9), `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0**.
