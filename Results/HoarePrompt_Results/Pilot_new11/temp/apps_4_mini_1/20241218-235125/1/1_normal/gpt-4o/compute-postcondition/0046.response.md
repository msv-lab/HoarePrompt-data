The variable `start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is `ind + 3` from the initial state, the output state will reflect this assignment. The other variables `s`, `n`, `bind`, and `ind` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3; `i` is `ind + 3; `start_colon` is `ind + 3.**
