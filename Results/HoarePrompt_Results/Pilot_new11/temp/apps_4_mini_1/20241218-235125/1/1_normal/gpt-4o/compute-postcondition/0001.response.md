The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the string `s`, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |. The length of `s` can range between 1 and 500,000 (inclusive). Therefore, `n` will be between 1 and 500,000 based on the input string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and | with a length between 1 and 500,000 (inclusive); `n` is an integer between 1 and 500,000 representing the length of `s`.**
