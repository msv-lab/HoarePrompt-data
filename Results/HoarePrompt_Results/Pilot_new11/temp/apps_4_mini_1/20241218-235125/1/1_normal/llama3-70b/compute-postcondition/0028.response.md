Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0. If `s[i]` is equal to '[', `f` is set to True and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is equal to ':', `i` is incremented to `i + 1` and `ind` is set to the value of `i`, effectively breaking out of the most inner loop or if statement.***
