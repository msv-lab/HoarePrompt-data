Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not ']'. If the character at index `i` of `s` is ':', and if the condition `f` is true, then `bind` is set to `i` (which is `n - 1`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
