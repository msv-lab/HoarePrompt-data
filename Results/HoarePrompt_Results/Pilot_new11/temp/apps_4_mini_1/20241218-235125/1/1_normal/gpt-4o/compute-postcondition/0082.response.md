Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, and `i` is less than or equal to `ind`. If a colon was not found before the loop began (`start_colon` is -1), if no colon was found in the range (`end_colon` is -1), or if `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, the value -1 is printed. Otherwise, `start_colon` and `end_colon` are valid indices with `start_colon` less than `end_colon - 1`, `end_colon` not equal to -1, `pipe_count` is the total number of '|' characters found between the indices `start_colon + 1` and `end_colon`, and `result` is equal to `4 + pipe_count`, which is printed.***
