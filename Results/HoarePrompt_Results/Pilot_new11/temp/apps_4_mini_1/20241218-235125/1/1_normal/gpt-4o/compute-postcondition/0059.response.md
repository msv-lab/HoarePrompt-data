Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `start_colon` is -1 or a valid index if a colon is present, and `end_colon` is equal to `bind - 2`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is ':', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
