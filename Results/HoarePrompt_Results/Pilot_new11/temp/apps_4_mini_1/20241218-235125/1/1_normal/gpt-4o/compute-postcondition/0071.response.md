The variable `pipe_count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged as no other operations are performed on them. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `pipe_count`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `start_colon + 1`, `start_colon` must be less than `end_colon - 1`, `end_colon` is a valid index not equal to -1, the character at index `i` of `s` is '|', and `pipe_count` is incremented by 1.**
