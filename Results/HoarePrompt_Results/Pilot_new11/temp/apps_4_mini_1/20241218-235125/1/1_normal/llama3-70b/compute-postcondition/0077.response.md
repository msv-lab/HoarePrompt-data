Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `f` is True if at least one ']' was present, and False otherwise; `bind` is the index of the last ':' found after the last ']', or -1 if no such configuration exists; `ind` is not -1 and `bind` is not -1. If `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, the output printed is -1. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `4 + k`, where `k` is the count of '|' characters between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1, and the value printed is `ans`.***
