Functionality: **The function processes an input string `s` that consists of lowercase Latin letters and the characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It performs the following operations:

1. It attempts to find the index of the first occurrence of the character `[`. If it does not exist, it sets the index `ind` to -1.
2. It then looks for the last occurrence of the character `]` in the string, setting the index `bind` accordingly. If `]` is absent, `bind` will be -1.
3. If either `ind` is -1 (no `[` found), or `bind` is -1 (no `]` found), or if `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, the function prints -1, indicating an invalid configuration of brackets.
4. If valid indices for `[` and `]` are found, it searches between these two indices for the first colon `:`, setting `start_colon` accordingly. If no colon is found, it remains -1.
5. A search for the last colon `:` occurring before the `]` is performed, setting `end_colon`. If found, this will indicate the upper limit for counting pipe characters.
6. If either `start_colon` is -1 (no `:` found after `[`), or `end_colon` is -1 (no `:` found before `]`), or `start_colon` is greater than or equal to `end_colon`, it prints -1.
7. If valid `start_colon` and `end_colon` are found, it counts the number of `|` characters between them and sets `pipe_count` to this value. 
8. Finally, it computes a result as `4 + pipe_count` and prints this value.

The function does not return anything explicitly; it only prints the results or -1 for invalid scenarios. Edge cases such as no brackets or colons present lead directly to a print of -1. The functionality is confirmed by the actual code, which behaves according to the annotations but with specific edge cases covered explicitly in the execution flow.**
