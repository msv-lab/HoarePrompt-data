The variable `start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The condition states that `i` is `ind + 1` and `start_colon` is updated to that value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s` (bind >= 0 and `bind > ind`); `i` is `ind + 1`; `start_colon` is equal to `i`.**
