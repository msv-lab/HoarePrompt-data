The variable `start_colon` is assigned a value of -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The previous values of `s`, `n`, `bind`, and `i` are still valid, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`, which exists (bind >= 0) and is greater than `ind` (ind < bind); `i` is -1 after all iterations are completed; `start_colon` is -1.**
