According to the code, the loop is structured to iterate from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute, `ind + 1` must be less than `bind`. Since `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s`, it must be greater than `ind`. 

Furthermore, at the start of the loop, the variable `i` will first be assigned the value of `ind + 1`. Thus, we need to ensure that after the adjustments, `i` is correctly set to `ind + 1`.

To summarize, the conditions that need to be satisfied for the loop to execute are:
1. `ind < bind - 1` (which implies `ind + 1 < bind`).
2. `i` must be initialized to `ind + 1`.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of ']' in `s` (bind >= 0 and `bind > ind`); `i` is ind + 1; `start_colon` is -1.**
