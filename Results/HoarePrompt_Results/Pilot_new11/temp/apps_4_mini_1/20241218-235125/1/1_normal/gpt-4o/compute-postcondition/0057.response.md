The variable `end_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is defined as `bind - 2`. Since we know that `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is guaranteed to be at least `1`. The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `bind`, `start_colon`, and `end_colon` before this assignment) are not affected. Thus, `end_colon` takes on the value of `i`, which is calculated as `bind - 2`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is at least 1, `bind` is greater than `ind + 1`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `start_colon` is -1 or a valid index if a colon is present, `end_colon` is equal to `bind - 2`.**
