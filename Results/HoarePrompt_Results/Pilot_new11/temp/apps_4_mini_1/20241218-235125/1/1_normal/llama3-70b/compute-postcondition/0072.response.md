According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `bind`, and `ind`. The loop starts with `i` at `ind + 1` and will iterate up to, but not including, `bind`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is currently `ind + 1`
- For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < bind` must still hold true. 
- Since `i` will be incremented to `ind + 2` at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that `ind + 2` is still less than `bind`. This implies that `bind` must be greater than `ind + 2`.

Thus, the adjusted states for the next iteration would be:
- `i` becomes `ind + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- The specific condition regarding `bind` should state that it must be greater than `ind + 2`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is greater than 0; `f` is True if at least one ']' was present, and False otherwise; `bind` is greater than `ind + 2`; `ind` is not -1 and `bind` is not -1; `i` is `ind + 2`**
