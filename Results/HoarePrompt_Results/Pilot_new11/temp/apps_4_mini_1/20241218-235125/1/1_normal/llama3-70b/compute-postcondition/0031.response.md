The value of `f` is assigned to `False`, directly overriding the previous state where `f` was potentially `True` if at least one '[' had been encountered. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0; `ind` is the index of the first ':' character that follows a '[', or remains -1 if no such ':' exists; `f` is False; `bind` is -1**
