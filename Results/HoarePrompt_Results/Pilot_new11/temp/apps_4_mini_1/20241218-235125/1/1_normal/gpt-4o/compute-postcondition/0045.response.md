According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `bind`, and the loop conditions. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ind + 2`, and since the loop runs from `ind + 1` to `bind`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `ind + 3`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bind`, so `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3`.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is at least 1; `bind` must be greater than `ind + 3; `i` is `ind + 3`**
