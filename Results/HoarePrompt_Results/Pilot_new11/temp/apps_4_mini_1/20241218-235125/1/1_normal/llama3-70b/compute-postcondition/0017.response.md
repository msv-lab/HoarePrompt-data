The code assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. The previous value of `i` is known to be `i + 1`, thus `ind` will be equal to `i + 1`. The states of all the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and the characters [, ], :, and |; `n` is the length of `s`, which is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1; `ind` is `i + 1`.**
