The code snippet `print(-1)` does not change the values of any of the existing variables; it simply prints `-1` to the output. The condition and calculations related to the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, `L`, and `min_x` remain valid after the code has been executed as no assignment or operation modifies them.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers assigned from input values; `min_x` is equal to `(L + M - 1) // M`; and the condition `M * min_x > N - K` holds true.**
