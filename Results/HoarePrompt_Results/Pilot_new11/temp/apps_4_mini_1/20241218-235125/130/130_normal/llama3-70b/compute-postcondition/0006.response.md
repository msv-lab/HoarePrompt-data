The function `func` accepts four parameters: `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. All parameters are positive integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. However, the output or return value of the function is not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide details on the return value without additional information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts four positive integer parameters: N, M, K, and L, under the constraints 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18; however, the return value is not defined.**
