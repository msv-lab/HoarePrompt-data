Functionality: **The function accepts four positive integers N, M, K, and L. It checks whether M is greater than or equal to both (N - K + 1) and L. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 1, indicating that M meets the criteria. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that M does not meet the criteria. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result based on the evaluation of the conditions. Note that potential edge cases, such as what happens if M is on the boundary of the conditions or if any of the input parameters exceed expected values beyond given constraints, are not handled in the code.**
