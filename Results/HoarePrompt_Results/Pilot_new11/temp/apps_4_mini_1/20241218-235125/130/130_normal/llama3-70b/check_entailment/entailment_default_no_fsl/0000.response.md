To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze how the code functions against the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
Ivan has N different collectible coins and currently owns K coins. His M friends want to gift coins under the following constraints:
1. Each friend must gift the same number of coins.
2. All coins gifted must be distinct.
3. At least L coins out of the total gifts must be new to Ivan's collection.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of coins each friend can gift to meet these requirements, or return -1 if it's impossible.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    if M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

### Output Hints Recap:
- The function checks if M is at least as large as \( N - K + 1 \) and L.
- If both conditions hold, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints -1.

### Conditions:
1. **M must be greater than or equal to \( N - K + 1 \)**: This checks if enough friends are present to provide coins that are not already in Ivan's collection (this includes both new coins and the ones he already owns).
2. **M must also be greater than or equal to L**: This ensures at least L new coins will be gifted.

### Problematic Cases:
1. **Minimum Coin Calculation**: The code suggests that if both conditions are satisfied, then the minimum number of coins each friend can gift is 1. However, this doesn't necessarily account for scenarios where M might need to gift more than 1 coin to ensure L new coins.
2. **Distinct Coin Requirement**: The implementation does not guarantee that the coins will be distinct among M friends under all allocations.

### Example Considerations:
- **Example Provided**: 
  - Input `20 15 2 3` should return `1`.
  - Input `10 11 2 4` should return `-1`.
  
All examples align well with the program's output, but it does not consider cases where if \( M \) is just slightly less than \( N \) or when there might be ranges of L that push the friends to gift more than 1 coin.

### Edge Cases:
Consider the following input:
- Input: `5 3 3 2`
  - Here we have 5 total coins, 3 friends, and Ivan already has 3 coins. If the friends want to gift at least 2 new coins, they cannot do it with just 1 distinct gift each since there are only 2 new coins. The program would mistakenly print `1` while it should print `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The condition checks in the code do not comprehensively handle all potential edge cases and scenarios where the rules may conflict with each other. Therefore, due to the oversight in guaranteeing enough unique coins could be provided by friends, the program fails to implement the solution correctly for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
