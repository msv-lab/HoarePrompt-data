Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where Ivan's friends have to give gifts that are not less than the total number of coins he already owns (K). Specifically, the program computes the minimum number of coins each of Ivan's friends can give using the formula `(L + M - 1) // M`, which calculates the ceiling of `L / M` but does not consider the condition that the total number of distinct coins given (M * min_x) must also be less than or equal to the remaining distinct coins available (N - K). 

For example, consider the input:

```
10 2 9 1
```

In this case:
- N = 10 (total different coins)
- M = 2 (number of friends)
- K = 9 (coins Ivan already has)
- L = 1 (new coins required)

According to the program:
- To satisfy the new coin requirement, `min_x = (1 + 2 - 1) // 2 = 1`
- Then it checks if `2 * 1 <= (10 - 9)` which becomes `2 <= 1`, which is false.

However, the program correctly returns `-1` indicating it's not possible. 

But if we have:
```
10 2 8 2
```

In this case:
- N = 10 (total different coins)
- M = 2 (number of friends)
- K = 8 (coins Ivan already has)
- L = 2 (new coins required)

The program would compute:
- `min_x = (2 + 2 - 1) // 2 = 1`
- Check if `2 * 1 <= (10 - 8)` which becomes `2 <= 2`, which is true.

It should print `1`, which is acceptable. However, this formulation fails to reassure that `L` new coins can fit in a distinct manner versus total available options. 

Thus, while the program seems to have the logic for certain cases, it doesn't robustly ensure all edge cases regarding distinct coin provision are addressed.

Overall, the program lacks completeness in its conditional checks for the task's requirements, demonstrating a failure in correctness.
