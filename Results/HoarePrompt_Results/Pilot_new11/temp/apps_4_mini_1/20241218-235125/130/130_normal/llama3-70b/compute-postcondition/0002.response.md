The `print(1)` statement does not change any of the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, or `L`. It simply outputs the integer `1` to the console. Therefore, the precondition remains valid, and no variable updates occur.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer, `L` is a positive integer, where `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1`, and `M` is also greater than or equal to `L`.**
