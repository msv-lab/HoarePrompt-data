To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and the potential edge cases based on the problem description.

### Program Logic:
1. The program checks if the number of friends `M` is greater than or equal to the necessary new coins (`N - K + 1`), which accounts for the coins Ivan does not already have. It also checks if `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, the minimum number of new coins that must be gifted.
2. If both conditions are true, it prints `1`, indicating that at least 1 coin per friend is enough.
3. If either condition is false, it prints `-1`, indicating that it is not possible for the friends to satisfy the gifting conditions.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When all friends need to gift different coins but there are not enough different coins**: If `M` is greater than `N`, this indicates that there are more friends than unique coins available, making it impossible to gift different coins. This case should return `-1`.

2. **Checking conditions with large values**: 
   - When `K = N` (Ivan has all coins), `L > 0` leads to a situation where the required new coins cannot be obtained, hence the output should be `-1`.
   - When `K = N - 1` and `L = 1`, the output should still be `1`, as Ivan is missing only one type of coin, making it possible for friends to give him that one missing type.

3. **Insufficient new coins**: If `L` (minimum new coins required) is larger than the remaining types of coins that Ivan does not have, it should return `-1`. Specifically, if `L > N - K`, it clearly indicates that satisfying this requirement is impossible.

### Testing with Examples:
- **Test case**: `N = 20, M = 15, K = 2, L = 3`
    - Remaining coins Ivan does not have: `N - K = 20 - 2 = 18`
    - Minimum new coins required: `3`
    - Friends: `15`
    - Output is `1` (correct, at least 1 coin per friend suffices).
  
- **Test case**: `N = 10, M = 11, K = 2, L = 4`
    - Remaining coins Ivan does not have: `N - K = 10 - 2 = 8`
    - Minimum new coins required is `4`.
    - We have `11` friends, which exceeds the available types of coins (`10`), hence output should be `-1`.

### Flaw in Current Implementation
The current implementation fails to handle cases where the coins `M` exceed the coins `N`. It does not check for the basic constraint that there cannot be more friends than available unique coins.

### Conclusion
The program does not check for multiple edge cases where it may print incorrect values, especially regarding the number of friends vs. the number of coins available.

Thus, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
