To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description in detail.

The program aims to find the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to Ivan, such that:
1. All coins gifted must be different.
2. At least `L` of the coins must be new (i.e., not already in Ivan's collection).
3. Each of Ivan's `M` friends must give the same number of coins, `x`.

### Logic Breakdown:
1. The input values are:
   - `N`: Total number of different collectible coins.
   - `M`: Number of Ivan's friends.
   - `K`: Number of coins Ivan already has.
   - `L`: Minimum number of new coins that should be gifted.

2. The expression `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` calculates the minimum number of coins each friend must give so that when multiplied by the number of friends `M`, the total number of new coins gifted is at least `L`. This uses ceiling division to ensure that if there's a remainder, it rounds up.

3. The conditional statement checks whether the total number of coins gifted (which is `M * min_x`) does not exceed the possible new coins that can be given to Ivan, which is `(N - K)`. This ensures that all the coins given are different and possible within the limits of total collectible coins.

4. If the conditions are satisfied, it prints `min_x`, otherwise it prints `-1`.

### Possible Cases to Consider:

1. **Case when `L` is larger than `M`:**
   If `L > M`, then the minimum `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` will be greater than 1 (because each friend giving at least one coin wonâ€™t be enough to satisfy `L`). It seems the program should still work, since if each friend gave `min_x` coins, it's possible some of those might still be duplicates of Ivan's coins.

2. **Case when `K` is very close to `N`:**
   If `K = N - 1`, and `M` is greater than 1, the only way for the friends to gift coins without duplicates would be impossible unless they each gave at least 1 (but it would reach `N` total coins quickly).

3. **Max boundary test:**
   The largest values for all inputs (e.g., `N = 10^18`, `M = 10^18`, `K = 10^18`, `L = 10^18`) should also be handled to check integer overflow conditions. Python can handle large integers, but logic still needs to accurately restrict conditions.

4. **Minimum values:**
   If `N = 1`, `K = 1`, and `M = L = 1`, then it's impossible to gift new coins, so it should return `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to handle different cases well based on the given checks, and the calculations seem valid according to the problem description. However, there are scenarios (like ones outlined above) where the logic could fail to guarantee `L` new coins can be given while satisfying all conditions. Specifically, the case where `K` is very close to `N` can make it impossible for friends to gift the required number of unique coins.

Thus, we conclude the correctness based on potential edge cases:

Correctness: **False**. 
Case present: When `N = 2`, `K = 1`, `M = 2`, and `L = 1`, the output should be `1` but since each friend cannot give a unique coin, it would output `-1`.
