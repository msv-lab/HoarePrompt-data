The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which are then converted to integers using the `map` function. However, the specific values of `a` and `b` depend on the input provided at runtime and are not predetermined. The states of `n`, `is_rated`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
