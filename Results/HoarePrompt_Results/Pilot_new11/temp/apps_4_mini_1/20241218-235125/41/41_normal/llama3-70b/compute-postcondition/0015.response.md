To analyze the loop provided in the task, we have the following parameters to consider:

- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \). This means the loop will iterate exactly `n` times.
- `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are initially empty lists.

During each iteration of the loop, two integer values `a` and `b` are read from input, and `a` is added to `ratings_before` while `b` is added to `ratings_after`. Since the loop runs exactly `n` times, both lists will ultimately contain `n` elements.

After the completion of all `n` iterations:

- `ratings_before` will include `n` inputs, each corresponding to the values of `a` gathered across the iterations.
- `ratings_after` will include `n` inputs, each corresponding to the values of `b` gathered across the iterations.
- The variables `a` and `b` will be the last input values received during the loop execution.

Therefore, the output state will confirm the lengths of these lists, their accumulation of values during the iterations, and the conditions necessary for the loop to run.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 1000 \); `ratings_before` contains `n` values which are the input integers corresponding to `a`; `ratings_after` contains `n` values which are the input integers corresponding to `b`; `a` is the last input integer received; `b` is the last input integer received.**
