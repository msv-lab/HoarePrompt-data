You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----

3060 3060
2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input

1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input
5
3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings_before.append(a)
        ratings_after.append(b)
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        if not unrated:
            break
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
    if rated:
        print('rated')
    elif unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the description of the problem, let's analyze the code carefully and identify any potential flaws based on the specifications of the problem description.

The program is supposed to:
1. Print "rated" if at least one participant's rating has changed (i.e., `a_i` is not equal to `b_i` for any `i`).
2. Print "unrated" if no participant's rating has changed and a participant with a lower rating appears to have better placement than one with a higher rating (i.e., `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`).
3. Print "maybe" if no participant's rating has changed and participants are sorted in non-increasing order of their ratings.

Now analyzing the implementation:

1. The structure of the implementation is correct in terms of the checks it is performing.
2. The program initializes flags for `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe`.
3. It checks each rating pair to determine if the ratings have changed. If there is a change, it immediately sets the flag to `rated`.
4. It then iterates through the array to check the order of the ratings while ensuring that it maintains the potential for `unrated`.
5. If the `unrated` check finds a contradiction, it sets the flag.

However, there is a critical flaw in its handling of the `unrated` and `maybe` states:

- The nested loop that assesses whether the rounds are rated or not does not explicitly handle the condition for setting the `maybe` state accurately. For instance, if all ratings are the same but the order is not properly managed to ensure strict decreases, the output may incorrectly be set to "maybe."

### Example Scenario to Identify Flaw:
- Input:
```
4
3000 3000
2500 2500
2200 2200
2400 2400
```
According to the problem description, this should result in "unrated" because the participant at position 4 has a higher rating than the participant at position 2 but is ranked poorer. However, the actual code would misrecognize this situation due to a flaw in the checks preceding the output, potentially leading to an incorrect output ("maybe").

Since there exists a scenario where the program does not behave as specified in the problem description, I can conclude that:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes ratings for a specified number of participants and classifies the outcome based on the relationship between their ratings before and after a round. It accepts an integer `n` indicating the number of participants and `n` pairs of integers representing their ratings before (`a_i`) and after (`b_i`) the round. After evaluating these ratings, the function prints one of three possible outcomes: 'rated' if at least one participant's before and after ratings differ, 'unrated' if there are no pairs where a participant with a lower before rating has a higher after rating than another participant, and 'maybe' if all participants have the same ratings before and after. The function ensures that all comparisons and evaluations stay within the specified limits for input sizes.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
