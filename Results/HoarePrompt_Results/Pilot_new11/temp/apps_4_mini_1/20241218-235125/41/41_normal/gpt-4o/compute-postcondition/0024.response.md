The value of `is_unrated` is changed to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True, `i` is 1, and the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` (which is `ratings[0]`) is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i` (which is `ratings[1]`).
