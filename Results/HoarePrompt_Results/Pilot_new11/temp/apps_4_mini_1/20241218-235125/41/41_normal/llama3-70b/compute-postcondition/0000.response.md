The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and it will be assigned a new integer value based on user input from the standard input.

After executing the code snippet, `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will now hold whatever integer value the user inputs, as long as it meets the condition of being an integer.

Therefore, the Output State is simply that `n` has taken on its new value based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 (based on user input)**
