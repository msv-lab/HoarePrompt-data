Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000. If `unrated` is true, 'unrated' is printed. Otherwise, if `unrated` is false, the function outputs 'maybe', maintaining that `rated` is False and that all elements `ratings_before[i]` are equal to `ratings_after[i]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`.***
