The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `unrated` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
