Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is True, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is a new input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `ratings` includes the tuple `(a, b)`, and the current iteration count is 2. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then the function proceeds with the logic for distinct values of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, there is no additional logic to execute.***
