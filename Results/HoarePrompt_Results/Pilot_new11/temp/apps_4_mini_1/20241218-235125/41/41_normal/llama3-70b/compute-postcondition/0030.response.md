The variable `unrated` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `unrated` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `unrated` is False.**
