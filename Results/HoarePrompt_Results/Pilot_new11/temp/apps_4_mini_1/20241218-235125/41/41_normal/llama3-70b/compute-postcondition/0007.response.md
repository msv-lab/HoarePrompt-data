According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute a total of `n` times, and the loop variable is effectively ignored. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must not have reached its limit, meaning we need to ensure that the iteration count is less than `n`. Given that the loop has already executed some times, to compute the next state we note that one more iteration would require the loop to be executed at least one more time, thus:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `ratings_before` includes the value of `a`; `ratings_after` includes the value of `b`.**
