The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 1000, `ratings` contains `n` tuples of integers, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
