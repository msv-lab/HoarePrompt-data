The code appends a tuple `(a, b)` to the list `ratings`. The values of `a` and `b` are both input integers but their specific values are not defined here. The other variables remain unchanged in their state.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 1000, `is_rated` is False, `is_unrated` is False, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings` now includes the tuple (a, b).**
