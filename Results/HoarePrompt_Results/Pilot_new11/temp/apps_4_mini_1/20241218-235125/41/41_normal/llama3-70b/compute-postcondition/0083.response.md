According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has executed for the first time. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since the loop is defined by `for i in range(n)`, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, after this iteration, `i` will become 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, and `rated` is True.**
