You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----

2194 2194

Output
rated

Input

1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

5
3123 3123
2777 2777

2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings.append((a, b))
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
    if not is_rated:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
    if is_rated:
        print('rated')
    elif is_unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's break down both the problem description and the program logic.

### Problem Description Breakdown
1. If at least one participant's rating has changed (i.e., `a_i` ≠ `b_i` for any participant), the round is "rated".
2. If no participant's rating has changed and a participant with a lower initial rating (`a_i`) placed higher than another with a higher initial rating, the round is "unrated".
3. If no participant's rating has changed and the rankings are correct according to their initial ratings (i.e., they maintain non-increasing order), it is "maybe".

### Program Logic Breakdown
- The program reads the number of participants and their ratings before and after the round.
- It checks for any rating changes to set `is_rated`.
- If no ratings changed, it checks the order of participants to determine if it can print "unrated".

### Analyzing Potential Cases
1. **Case with Changed Ratings (Rated)**: 
   - If the input is:
     ```
     3
     2000 2100
     2100 2200
     1900 1900
     ```
   The output should be "rated" and the program correctly identifies this scenario.

2. **Case with No Changed Ratings but Wrong Order (Unrated)**:
   - If the input is:
     ```
     4
     3000 3000
     2500 2500
     2800 2800
     2900 2900
     ```
   The ratings before the round are out of order (3000, 2500, 2800, 2900), and since no ratings changed, the output should be "unrated", which is handled correctly by the program.

3. **Case with No Changed Ratings and Correct Order (Maybe)**:
   - If the input is:
     ```
     3
     3000 3000
     2800 2800
     2500 2500
     ```
   The output should be "maybe" again, which the program outputs correctly.

### Problematic Case
To challenge the assumptions made by the program, consider the following input:
```
5
1500 1500
1600 1600
1700 1700
1800 1800
1700 1900
```
Here, the final participant's rating changed (1700 to 1900) and thus it should clearly return "rated". However, under the conditions considered, if the program mistakenly checks the ratings first before judging if there's a rating change, it might produce incorrect logical paths (if it had incorrectly segregated the conditions).

### Conclusion
The core condition checks in the program do manage to cover the outlined scenarios based on rigorous testing of edge cases. Thus, the implementation captures all necessary criteria from the prompt effectively without omission.

Thus based on the analysis above, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
