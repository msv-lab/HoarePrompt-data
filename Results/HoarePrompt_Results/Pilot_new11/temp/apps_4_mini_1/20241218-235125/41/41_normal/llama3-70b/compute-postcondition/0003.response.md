According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer that satisfies the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, this means the loop will execute exactly `n` times. The two lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are currently empty but do not affect the execution of the loop itself. During the first execution of the loop, it is typical to initialize any loop control variables if used within the loop body.

To ensure the loop executes correctly, the key points are that `n` is valid, and we also need to define the iterated variable (which is denoted as `_` here, but has no effect on the state since it's unused). As the loop executes, the values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` should be understood as relevant to the loop body but do not need to be adjusted for just the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly, the key state is simply that `n` already meets its condition, so no further modifications are needed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000**
