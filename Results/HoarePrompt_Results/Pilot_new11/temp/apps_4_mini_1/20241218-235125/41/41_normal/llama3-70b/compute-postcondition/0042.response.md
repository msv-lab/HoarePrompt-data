Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `unrated` is initially True. If the value of `ratings_before[i]` is less than the value of `ratings_before[j]` and the value of `ratings_after[i]` is greater than the value of `ratings_after[j]`, `unrated` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `unrated` remains True.***
