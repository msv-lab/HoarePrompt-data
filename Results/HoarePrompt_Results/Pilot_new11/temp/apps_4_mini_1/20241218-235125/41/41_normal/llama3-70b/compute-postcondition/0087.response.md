Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `rated` is True if there is at least one index `i` such that `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, otherwise `rated` is False; `i` is 0 to `n-1` depending on the number of iterations; `unrated` remains unchanged based on the relationship of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`.**
