According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop starts from `j = i + 1`, which means in this case, since `i` is 0, `j` starts at 1. The next iteration will increment `j` until it reaches `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. As `j` is currently 1, the loop will execute again as long as `n` is greater than 2, which would allow `j` to become 2.

Thus, after this iteration, the states should be as follows:
- `j` will be incremented to 2.
- `n` must remain greater than 2 in order for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
