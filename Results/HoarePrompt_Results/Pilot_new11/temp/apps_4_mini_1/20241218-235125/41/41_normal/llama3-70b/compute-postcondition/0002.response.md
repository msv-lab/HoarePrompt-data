The code initializes `ratings_after` as an empty list. The previous state indicates that `ratings_before` is also an empty list, and `n` is within the range of 2 to 1000. Since only the variable `ratings_after` is being modified, and it is set to an empty list, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `ratings_before` is an empty list; `ratings_after` is an empty list.**
