The `Counter` function will create a count of each unique integer in the `cards` list. The initial state indicates that `cards` contains `n` integers, and since `n` is an even integer within the range of 2 to 100, `count` will hold the frequency of each integer in the `cards`.

Given that `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `count` will be a dictionary-like object where the keys are the integers from `cards`, and the values are how many times each integer appears in the list.

The state of other variables remains unchanged since `count` only introduces a new variable without modifying existing ones.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequencies of each integer in `cards`.**
