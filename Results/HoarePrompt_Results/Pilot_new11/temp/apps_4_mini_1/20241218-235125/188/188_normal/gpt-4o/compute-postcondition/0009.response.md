The code prints the last two elements of the `unique_numbers` list, which contains the two most frequent integers from the `cards` list. Since the counts of the most frequent integers are both equal to n // 2, and there are at least two unique integers, the last two elements of `unique_numbers` will represent the two highest unique integers by frequency.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequencies of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique integers based on their frequency in ascending order, length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or greater; the output is 'YES'; printed values are the two most frequent integers in `unique_numbers`.**
