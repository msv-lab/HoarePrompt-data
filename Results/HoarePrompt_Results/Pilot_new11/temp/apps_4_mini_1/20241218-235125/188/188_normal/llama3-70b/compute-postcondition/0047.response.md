The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `i`, which means `a2` now holds the current value of `i`. The initial state has `a1` as the previous value of `i`, but it remains unchanged. The other variables, `n`, `a`, `d`, and `c`, are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must have at least `m + 1` elements, `c` is unchanged or updated based on previous values, `a1` is the previous value of `i`, `a2` is equal to the current value of `i`.**
