The code snippet sorts the unique keys of the `count` Counter object (which represents the frequencies of each integer in `cards`) based on their frequencies in ascending order. The `unique_numbers` variable will thus be assigned a sorted list of unique integers from `cards`, where the sorting is done according to the frequency of each integer.

Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `cards` is populated with `n` integers within the specified range, and `count` contains the frequencies of these integers.

Therefore, the output will reflect that `unique_numbers` has been assigned a list of unique integers sorted by frequency.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequencies of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique integers based on their frequency in ascending order.**
