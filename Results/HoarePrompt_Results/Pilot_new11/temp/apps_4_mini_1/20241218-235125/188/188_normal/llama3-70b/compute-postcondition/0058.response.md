The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly because it relies on input being provided through standard input or similar means. However, it processes a sequence of integers based on the specified constraints. The first input is an even integer `n`, which must be between 2 and 100 (inclusive). Following this, the function reads `n` integers (`a_i`), each of which can have a value between 1 and 100.

After executing the function body, it returns a result based on the input data. However, since no specific output behavior is given in the prompt, we cannot define it explicitly here.

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers (`a_i`, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) and processes this input accordingly, returning a result based on the constraints.**
