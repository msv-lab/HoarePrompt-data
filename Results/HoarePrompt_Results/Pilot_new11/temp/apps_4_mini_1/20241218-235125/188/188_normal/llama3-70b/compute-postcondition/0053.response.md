The code execution only involves printing the string 'YES', and it doesn't change any of the variables or their states. Therefore, the variables retain their original values. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100; `a` contains `n` integers; `d` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are the integers from `a` and the values are their counts; `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, indicating how many elements with a count equal to `n // 2` have been found; `a1` contains the first integer found with a count of `n // 2`; `a2` contains the second integer found with a count of `n // 2`; the value 'YES' has been printed.**
