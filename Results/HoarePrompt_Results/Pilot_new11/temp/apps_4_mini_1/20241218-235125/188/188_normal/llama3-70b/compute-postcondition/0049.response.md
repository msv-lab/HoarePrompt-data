Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` must have at least `m + 1` elements. If `c` was previously 0, then `c` is updated to its previous value plus 1, `a1` is equal to the current value of `i`, and `a2` is the previous value of `i`. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged or is updated based on previous values, `a1` is the previous value of `i`, and `a2` is equal to the current value of `i`, at which point we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
