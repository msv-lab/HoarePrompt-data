The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. This code initializes `c`, but it does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `d` in any way. Therefore, the preconditions remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `c` is 0**.
