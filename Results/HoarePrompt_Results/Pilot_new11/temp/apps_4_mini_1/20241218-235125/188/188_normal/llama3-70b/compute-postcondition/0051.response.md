Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs where the keys are the integers from `a` and the values are their counts; `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, indicating how many elements with a count equal to `n // 2` have been found, `a1` contains the first integer found with a count of `n // 2` (if any), `a2` contains the second integer found with a count of `n // 2` (if any), and if no such integers were found `a1` and `a2` remain -1.**
