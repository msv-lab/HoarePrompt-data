Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequencies of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique integers based on their frequency in ascending order, and the length of `unique_numbers` is 2 or greater. The count of the most frequent integer in `cards` is equal to n // 2 and the count of the second most frequent integer in `cards` is also equal to n // 2.***
