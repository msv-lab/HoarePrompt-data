Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` integers, `d` is not empty, and if `c` is 0, then `c` is set to 1, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is -1, and the current value of the element `d[i]` is equal to `n` divided by 2. If `c` is a positive integer (not equal to 0), then `c` remains unchanged, `a1` is -1, `a2` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with the current value of the element `d[i]` still equal to `n` divided by 2.***
