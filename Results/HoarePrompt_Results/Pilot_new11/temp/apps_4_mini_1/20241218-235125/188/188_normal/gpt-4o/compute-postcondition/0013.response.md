Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `cards` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100; `count` is a Counter object representing the frequencies of each integer in `cards`; `unique_numbers` is a sorted list of unique integers based on their frequency in ascending order. If the length of `unique_numbers` is less than 2, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, if `unique_numbers` has a length of 2 or greater, the output is 'YES' if the most frequent and the second most frequent integers in `unique_numbers` both have a frequency of n // 2, with the printed values being these two most frequent integers; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
