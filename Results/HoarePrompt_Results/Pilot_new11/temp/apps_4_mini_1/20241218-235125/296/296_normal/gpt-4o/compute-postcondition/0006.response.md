The variable `divisors` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `i` is 2 and `divisors` starts as an empty list, after executing the code, `divisors` will contain the single element 2. The conditions for `n`, `i`, and `divisors` still hold true after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 2; `divisors` is a list containing 2; `i` is 2; and the current value of `n` is divisible by `i` (n % i == 0)**
