You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 2) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        print('YES')
        k = 2
        print(k)
        print('1', n // 2)
        print('1', n)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9. If `n` equals 2, then 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, 'YES' has been printed, the value 2 has been printed, and the output is '1' followed by the current value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `n` from input within the range 2 to 10^9. If `n` equals 2, it prints 'NO'. For all other values of `n`, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, and then outputs the string '1' along with the integer `n // 2`, and then again outputs '1' followed by the integer `n`. Note that there is no return value from the function and it does not accept any parameters. The function handles the edge case of `n` being exactly 2 distinctly from any other value of `n`. However, there are no checks or handling for values outside the specified range, which is stated to be between 2 and 10^9, should it not be guaranteed by the context of use.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
