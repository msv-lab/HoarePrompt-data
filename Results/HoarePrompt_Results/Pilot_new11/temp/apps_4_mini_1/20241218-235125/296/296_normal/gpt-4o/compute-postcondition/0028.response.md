The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The function checks the following conditions: 

- If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it returns 'NO'.
- If `n` has no divisors (indicating it is a prime number), it returns 'NO'.
- If `n` has one or more divisors, it returns 'YES', the number of divisors \(k\), and each fraction formed by the tuples \((1, d)\) for each divisor \(d\) in the list of divisors.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and determine if it is a prime number or not, returning appropriate messages and details based on the presence of divisors. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2 or if `n` is a prime number; otherwise, it returns 'YES', the number of divisors k, and each fraction (1, d) for each divisor d.**
