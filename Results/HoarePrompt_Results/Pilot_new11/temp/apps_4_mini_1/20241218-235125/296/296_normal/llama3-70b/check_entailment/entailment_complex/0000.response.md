Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Although it handles the input case where `n = 2` by printing "NO," it fails for other values of `n`. The output for values of `n > 2` does not match the requirement for the fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, where:

1. Each `b_i` must divide `n`.
2. Each `b_i` must satisfy `1 < b_i < n`.
3. The sum of the fractions must equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

In the case of any `n > 2`, the program incorrectly prints:

```
YES
2
1 n // 2
1 n
```

- The fraction `\(\frac{1}{n}\)` does not satisfy the requirement because `n` does not fulfill the condition `1 < b_i < n` (the largest value for `b_i` can be `n`, violating the strict inequality). Thus, it cannot be used as a valid denominator.
- The resulting fractions also do not necessarily satisfy that their sum equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \).

For instance, if `n = 6`, the program would output "1 3" and "1 6", leading to:

\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}, 
\]

which contradicts fulfilling \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} \) since \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \).

Conclusively, the program does not create the required sequence of fractions according to the specified rules, thus failing to comply with the problem description adequately.
