You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a positive integer $n$.

Find a sequence of fractions $\frac{a_i}{b_i}$, $i = 1 \ldots k$ (where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers) for some $k$ such that:

$$ \begin{cases} \text{$b_i$ divides $n$, $1 < b_i < n$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$1 \le a_i < b_i$ for $i = 1 \ldots k$} \\ \text{$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$} \end{cases} $$


-----Input-----

The input consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

In the first line print "YES" if there exists such a sequence of fractions or "NO" otherwise.

If there exists such a sequence, next lines should contain a description of the sequence in the following format.

The second line should contain integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100\,000$) — the number of elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that if such a sequence exists, then there exists a sequence of length at most $100\,000$.

Next $k$ lines should contain fractions of the sequence with two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ on each line.


-----Examples-----
Input
2

Output
NO

Input
6

Output
YES
2
1 2
1 3



-----Note-----

In the second example there is a sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}$ such that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}$.
Program:
```
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program, I will analyze the code and check if it satisfies all the problem requirements, specifically addressing the case when \( n = 2 \) and larger integers up to \( 10^9 \).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Check (Handling edge case \( n = 2 \))**:
   - The program starts by checking if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2. 
   - Since the input constraints state \( 2 \leq n \), the check logically appears to return 'NO' for \( n = 2 \) correctly. 

2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The code attempts to find divisors \( b_i \) of \( n \) by iterating from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} \). 
   - For even \( n \) greater than 2, the function collects divisors correctly.

3. **Forming Fractions**:
   - If there are divisors, it creates pairs \( (1, b_i) \) for each valid divisor.
   - It does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions equals \( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \). 

### Potential Issue:
The critical flaw is that while the program successfully finds divisors and generates the fractions \( (1/b_i) \), it lacks a formal check or computation to confirm that:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n}
\]

This might lead to incorrect configurations. Specifically, let's consider certain values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 4 \):
  - Divisors found: \( 2 \) (only).
  - Generated fraction: \( \frac{1}{2} \).
  - Required sum: \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \), which is not equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Conclusion:
The program might return 'YES' mistakenly for some \( n \) values without correctly verifying the equality condition outlined in the problem description. Thus, for the case \( n = 4 \), it would output 'YES', but the fractions would not sum up as required, thereby failing the problem criteria.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO' because the current value of n is less than or equal to 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is greater than 2.
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` contains all divisors of `n` except for `n` itself and is a list of integers greater than or equal to 2 that divides `n` without a remainder. If `n` is prime, then `divisors` remains an empty list.
    if (not divisors) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO' because the current value of `divisors` is empty, indicating that `n` is a prime number and has no divisors except for 1 and itself.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` except for `n` itself and is a non-empty list of integers greater than or equal to 2 that divides `n` without a remainder. This indicates that `n` is not prime.
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join(f'{a} {b}' for a, b in fractions)
    #The program returns 'YES', the number of divisors k, and each fraction formed by the tuples (1, d) for each d in the list of divisors
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^9). It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, returning 'NO' in such cases. If `n` is a prime number (indicated by an empty list of divisors), it also returns 'NO'. If `n` is not prime, it collects all divisors of `n` (other than 1 and `n` itself), returning 'YES' along with the count of these divisors and a list of fractions of the form (1, d) for each divisor `d`. The function handles potential edge cases involving the smallest inputs and correctly identifies prime numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
