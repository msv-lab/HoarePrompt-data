Postcondition: ***`low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest integer `mid` such that the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` does not equal `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum is equal to `s`, the value of `low` has been printed.***
