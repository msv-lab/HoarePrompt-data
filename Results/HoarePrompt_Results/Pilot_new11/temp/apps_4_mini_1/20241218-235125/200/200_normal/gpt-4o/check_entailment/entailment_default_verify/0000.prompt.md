You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let us analyze its logic based on the problem description. The task is to help the Fair Nut determine how much kvass can remain in the least keg after he pours a specified volume of kvass from n kegs.

1. **Input Validation**: The program reads two integers n (number of kegs) and s (liters to pour). It then reads a list of integers representing the volume of kvass in each keg. 

2. **Checking Total Volume**: The program checks if the total volume of kvass in all kegs is less than the required volume s. If true, it prints -1, as it is not possible to pour that much kvass.

3. **Keg Calculation**: The program aims to keep the kvass level in the least keg as high as possible. It tracks the minimum keg's volume and attempts to pour kvass from the other kegs without reducing the minimum keg too much.

4. **Pouring Logic**: It uses a for loop to pour kvass from each keg until it meets the required volume or exhausts the possibility of further pouring.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Edge Case 1**: When s is exactly equal to the total volume in the kegs. If the kegs contain varying volumes, the implementation needs to ensure that it can pour precisely s liters without violating the condition regarding the minimum keg.
  
- **Edge Case 2**: If all kegs have the same volume and s equals n times that volume, resulting in all kegs being emptied equally. In this case, the minimum keg can't be defined (should it be 0 or still considered the original volume).

Upon further analysis of the given program, I found a potential flaw, specifically in the calculation of the remaining kvass after it might have been depleted:

1. Suppose all kegs have an identical maximum volume, and s is such that the total available volume is just enough. The program may improperly reduce the minimum keg's possible volume below what it could have been because it doesn't correctly handle cases where further pouring would not improve the minimum keg's volume.

2. For an instance: If kegs have volumes `[5, 5, 5]` and `s = 5`: the correct output should be `5`, but in scenarios where poor iteration considers excess consumption from one keg reducing others prematurely could yield incorrect results.

Thus, due to these overlooked conditions where the program's mechanics may result in an incorrect minimum keg volume or incorrect output situation in edge cases, the final conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), a non-negative integer `s` (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), and a list of `n` integers `v` (1 ≤ v[i] ≤ 10^9). It first reads and processes these inputs, then computes the total volume of kvass represented by `v`. If the total volume is less than `s`, it outputs -1, indicating that the required amount cannot be met. If the total volume is sufficient, the function attempts to find and potentially adjust the minimum volume of kvass (`min_keg_volume`) needed to fulfill the requirement `s`. This is done by attempting to calculate how much kvass can be taken from volumes greater than the minimum and adjusting `min_keg_volume` accordingly. Finally, it prints the resulting `min_keg_volume`. The edge cases include handling the scenario where the total volume of kvass is exactly equal to `s`, which does not require any adjustments. Additionally, it also handles cases where no eligible volumes are greater than `min_keg_volume`. In these cases, `min_keg_volume` may be adjusted downward if there is remaining kvass that could not be taken from available volumes.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
