You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the provided program against the problem description, we'll analyze the logic to ensure that it correctly computes how much kvass can remain in the least keg after pouring exactly `s` liters.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` (number of kegs) and `s` (liters to pour), followed by an array of integers representing the volume in each keg.

2. **Sorting**: The array `v` (volumes) is sorted to easily access the minimum keg values.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum volume of kvass in the kegs.
   - The algorithm then performs binary search to determine the maximum possible value that the least filled keg can reach after pouring `s` liters. 
   - Within the loop, it calculates the total liters that can be poured from the kegs based on the middle point value `mid`.
   - If the total poured is less than `s`, it adjusts the search range.

4. **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if the total that can be poured exactly equals `s`. If not, it returns -1.

**Potential Edge Case**:
- Consider an edge case where the total kvass available in the kegs is exactly `s`. If all kegs can be fully drained such that the minimum keg could still hold a certain volume, the program may not correctly calculate that necessary value because of the last conditional prompt that checks against `low`. 

For instance, take the inputs:
```
3 6
2 2 2
```
In this case, if `low` is 2 and all the kegs can be drained entirely to reach `s`, the program checks if `sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s` which returns `True` as it would be just 6 = 2 * 3. So it would print `-1` incorrectly in this scenario while the expected result should be 0 because it can take exactly all kvass needed.

Thus, while the approach tries to perform correctly, the final conditional can lead to incorrect outputs based on total kvass available versus `s`.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of kegs, a non-negative integer `s` representing a target sum, and a list of integers `v` representing the volumes of each keg. It calculates the largest integer `mid` (referred to as `low` in the final state) such that the total sum of the minimum between `mid` and each keg volume does not exceed `s`. If this total equals `s`, it prints the value of `low`. If the total does not equal `s`, it prints -1. It effectively performs a binary search to find this value while handling edge cases, such as potentially returning -1 when it is not possible to achieve the exact total sum `s` through the available keg volumes. The function ensures that `low` equals `high` after the binary search concludes, positioned at the largest possible keg volume allowed under the sum constraint. The overall outcome is based strictly on the relationship between the keg volumes and the target sum, confirming whether the desired total is achievable.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
