Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; if `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass` remains equal to 0 and `possible_to_take` remains unchanged; otherwise, `possible_to_take` is assigned the value `min(volumes[2] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)` and `remaining_kvass` is updated to `remaining_kvass - possible_to_take`.***
