You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of n integers where each integer v[i] satisfies 1 <= v[i] <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `remaining_kvass` equals the initial `s` minus the total kvass taken from eligible volumes; `possible_to_take` is the last value taken from the eligible volumes, or remains undefined if no volumes were eligible; `i` is `n`, representing all volumes attempted.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; if `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is decreased by `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. If `remaining_kvass` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `min_keg_volume`.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer satisfying 1 <= `s` <= 10^12; `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers; `total_volume` is the sum of integers in `volumes`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, the function maintains the current values of `n`, `s`, and `volumes`, and `total_volume` remains less than `s`. If `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `remaining_kvass` > 0, then `min_keg_volume` is adjusted by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`; otherwise, `min_keg_volume` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), a non-negative integer `s` (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^12), and a list of `n` integers `v` (1 ≤ v[i] ≤ 10^9). It first reads and processes these inputs, then computes the total volume of kvass represented by `v`. If the total volume is less than `s`, it outputs -1, indicating that the required amount cannot be met. If the total volume is sufficient, the function attempts to find and potentially adjust the minimum volume of kvass (`min_keg_volume`) needed to fulfill the requirement `s`. This is done by attempting to calculate how much kvass can be taken from volumes greater than the minimum and adjusting `min_keg_volume` accordingly. Finally, it prints the resulting `min_keg_volume`. The edge cases include handling the scenario where the total volume of kvass is exactly equal to `s`, which does not require any adjustments. Additionally, it also handles cases where no eligible volumes are greater than `min_keg_volume`. In these cases, `min_keg_volume` may be adjusted downward if there is remaining kvass that could not be taken from available volumes.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
