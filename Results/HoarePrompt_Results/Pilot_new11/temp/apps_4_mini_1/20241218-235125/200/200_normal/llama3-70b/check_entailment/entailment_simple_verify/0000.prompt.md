You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum((min(mid, x) for x in v))
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the provided program against the problem description, we'll analyze the logic to ensure that it correctly computes how much kvass can remain in the least keg after pouring exactly `s` liters.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `n` (number of kegs) and `s` (liters to pour), followed by an array of integers representing the volume in each keg.

2. **Sorting**: The array `v` (volumes) is sorted to easily access the minimum keg values.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum volume of kvass in the kegs.
   - The algorithm then performs binary search to determine the maximum possible value that the least filled keg can reach after pouring `s` liters. 
   - Within the loop, it calculates the total liters that can be poured from the kegs based on the middle point value `mid`.
   - If the total poured is less than `s`, it adjusts the search range.

4. **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if the total that can be poured exactly equals `s`. If not, it returns -1.

**Potential Edge Case**:
- Consider an edge case where the total kvass available in the kegs is exactly `s`. If all kegs can be fully drained such that the minimum keg could still hold a certain volume, the program may not correctly calculate that necessary value because of the last conditional prompt that checks against `low`. 

For instance, take the inputs:
```
3 6
2 2 2
```
In this case, if `low` is 2 and all the kegs can be drained entirely to reach `s`, the program checks if `sum((min(low, x) for x in v)) != s` which returns `True` as it would be just 6 = 2 * 3. So it would print `-1` incorrectly in this scenario while the expected result should be 0 because it can take exactly all kvass needed.

Thus, while the approach tries to perform correctly, the final conditional can lead to incorrect outputs based on total kvass available versus `s`.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of integers representing the volume of each keg where each value v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest integer `mid` such that the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the initial values of `s` and the elements in `v` allow for multiple iterations, then the final values of `low` and `high` converge to the point where no further valid `mid` can be calculated that satisfies the condition, while the value of `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. Any adjustments to `low` and `high` during the loop have ensured that `low` is now equal to `high` without exceeding the limits defined by the relationships to `s` and `v`.`
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest integer `mid` such that the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` does not equal `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum is equal to `s`, the value of `low` has been printed.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
