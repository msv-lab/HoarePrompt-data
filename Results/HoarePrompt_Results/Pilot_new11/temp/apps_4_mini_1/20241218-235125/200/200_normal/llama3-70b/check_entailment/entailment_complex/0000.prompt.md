You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, s is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= s <= 10^12, and v is a list of integers representing the volume of each keg where each value v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest integer `mid` such that the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the initial values of `s` and the elements in `v` allow for multiple iterations, then the final values of `low` and `high` converge to the point where no further valid `mid` can be calculated that satisfies the condition, while the value of `total` is the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v`. Any adjustments to `low` and `high` during the loop have ensured that `low` is now equal to `high` without exceeding the limits defined by the relationships to `s` and `v`.`
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`low` is equal to `high`, which is the largest integer `mid` such that the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each `x` in `v` is less than or equal to `s`. If the sum of `min(low, x)` for each `x` in `v` does not equal `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum is equal to `s`, the value of `low` has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of kegs, a non-negative integer `s` representing a target sum, and a list of integers `v` representing the volumes of each keg. It calculates the largest integer `mid` (referred to as `low` in the final state) such that the total sum of the minimum between `mid` and each keg volume does not exceed `s`. If this total equals `s`, it prints the value of `low`. If the total does not equal `s`, it prints -1. It effectively performs a binary search to find this value while handling edge cases, such as potentially returning -1 when it is not possible to achieve the exact total sum `s` through the available keg volumes. The function ensures that `low` equals `high` after the binary search concludes, positioned at the largest possible keg volume allowed under the sum constraint. The overall outcome is based strictly on the relationship between the keg volumes and the target sum, confirming whether the desired total is achievable.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
