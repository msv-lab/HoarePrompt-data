The variable `v` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as sorting the list does not affect these integer values. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated status of `v` as a sorted list of integers. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the input integer such that 1 <= `s` <= 10^12; `v` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input.**
