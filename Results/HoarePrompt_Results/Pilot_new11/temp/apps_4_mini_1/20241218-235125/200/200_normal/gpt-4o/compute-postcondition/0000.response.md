The values of `n` and `s` are assigned the results of `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input values, splits them, and converts them into integers. The variable `n` still satisfies the condition `1 <= n <= 1000`, and `s` is now an integer that was input but will also be a non-negative integer satisfying `1 <= s <= 10^12`. The list `v` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `s` is a non-negative integer equal to the input value satisfying 1 <= s <= 10^12; `v` is a list of n integers where each integer v[i] satisfies 1 <= v[i] <= 10^9.**
