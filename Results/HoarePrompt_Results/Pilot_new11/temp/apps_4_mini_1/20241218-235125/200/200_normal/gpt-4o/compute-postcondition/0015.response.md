Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000 and `i` is 0. If `volumes[i]` is less than or equal to `min_keg_volume`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible_to_take` is set to the minimum of (`volumes[i] - min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`), and `remaining_kvass` is decreased by `possible_to_take`.***
