`dp[j]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[j]` and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The specific values of these variables have not been altered by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, and `dp[j]` is now equal to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]` mod `MOD`.**
