The value of `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`. Since `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j - 1]` will be the value from the `dp` array just before `j`. The modulo operation is not explicitly mentioned here, so we will focus only on the addition operation. It is given that `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, which implies that the index `j` is at least 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`**.
