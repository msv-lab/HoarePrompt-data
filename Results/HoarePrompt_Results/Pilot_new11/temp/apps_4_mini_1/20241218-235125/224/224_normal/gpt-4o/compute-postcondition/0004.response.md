The code updates `result` by multiplying it with `i` and then taking the modulus with `mod`. The previous value of `result` is 2, and the value of `i` is 3. Thus, the calculation is as follows:

- New value of `result` = (2 * 3) % 1000000007 = 6 % 1000000007 = 6.

The values of `n` and `mod` remain unchanged, and only `result` is updated. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 1000000007, `result` is 6, `i` is 3**.
