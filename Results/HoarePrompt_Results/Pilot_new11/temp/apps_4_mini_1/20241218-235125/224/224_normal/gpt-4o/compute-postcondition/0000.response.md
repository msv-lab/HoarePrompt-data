The variable `result` is initialized with the value 1. The value of `n` as stated remains unchanged because the code does not modify it, and the modulus value `mod` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial values along with the new value of `result`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6; `mod` is an integer representing the modulus value (1000000007); `result` is 1**
