In order to verify the correctness of the provided code according to the problem description, we need to analyze each function and their interactions carefully.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We want to find the number of permutations of integers from 1 to n such that the function `f(p)` (defined as the number of distinct GCDs among prefixes of the permutation) is equal to the maximum possible value of `f(p)` across all permutations.

2. **Examining `func_1(a, b)`**: 
   - This function correctly calculates the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The annotations describe accurately what the function does, capturing the state and output correctly.

3. **Examining `func_2(n)`**: 
   - This function iterates from 1 to `n`, calculating the maximum GCD obtainable from the values up to n. The implementation uses `func_1` on an accumulating maximum and the current value. 
   - However, `func_2` merely finds the maximum GCD from iterating through all integers from `1` to `n`, without considering valid permutations. This could potentially miss distinct permutations where multiple prefixes produce distinct GCDs. 

4. **Examining `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**: 
   - This function calculates the number of ways to utilize integers from `1` to `n` to achieve the count of sums equal to `f_max_n`. However, the description implies that `f_max_n` should correlate directly to `f(p)` counting permutations, which this function does not ensure.

5. **Analyzing Edge Cases**:
   - It is important to note that while the functions accept valid input ranges (2 <= n <= 10^6), the logic does not explicitly handle edge cases regarding the calculations based on the properties of GCD and distinctness in permutations. The output from `func_2` may not capture all cases of `f_max(n)`, especially if `f_max(n)` is not directly convertible to valid sums that `func_3` computes.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - Let's consider an example case where `n=3`, the expected output is 4 as demonstrated in the problem statement. The code may not provide the expected number of valid permutations effectively since `func_2` may not distinguish the valid configurations leading up to the output.

Given these observations, particularly around `func_2` not ensuring valid counts considering permutations and `func_3` possibly being misaligned with the requirements of the final counts, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description completely because it does not correctly handle the distinct counting of all permutations of `f(p)` and pose an invalid connection between `f_max_n` and its subsequent calculation within `func_3`.
