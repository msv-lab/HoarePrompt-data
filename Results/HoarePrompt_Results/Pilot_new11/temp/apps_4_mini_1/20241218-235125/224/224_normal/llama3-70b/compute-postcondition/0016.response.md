The operation `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` modifies the value of `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - 1]` to it. The values of `n`, `i`, `f_max_n`, and `j` are not directly altered by this operation, but their existence influences the context of the update made to the `dp` array. 

Given that `j` is equal to `f_max_n` and `f_max_n` is defined to be greater than or equal to 1, it's important to note that `dp[j - 1]` refers to the element just before `dp[j]`. Since `j` must also be at least 1 to access `dp[j - 1]`, we can conclude the conditions are valid and the operation can take place.

Thus, the Output State reflects the potential alteration in the `dp` array for index `j`, while still retaining the conditions of the other variables:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 2, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
