The expression `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[j]` by adding the current value of `dp[j - 1]` to it. The value of `j` is defined as `f_max_n - 2`, and as we know, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, which implies that `j` is at least 0. The initial value of `dp[j]` will be updated based on the previous value of `dp[j - 1]`.

The variable `dp[j]` changes as follows:
- If `dp[j - 1]` is known, then `dp[j]` will be updated to its previous value plus the value of `dp[j - 1]`.

The states of all other variables (`n`, `i`, `f_max_n`, `j`, `dp`) are not explicitly given in the task and are assumed to remain valid with the specific range and conditions that have been outlined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `j` is `f_max_n - 2`; `dp[j]` has been updated to `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
