The expression `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` modifies the value of `dp[j]` based on its previous state and the state of `dp[j - 1]`. Since `j` is initialized to `f_max_n`, the output state depends on the values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`. Note that `j` must be a valid index in the `dp` list, which starts from an appropriate index based on the value of `f_max_n`.

Since we don't have the actual values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]`, we will describe the change in general terms:

1. The previous value of `dp[j]` is updated by adding to it the value of `dp[j - 1]`.
2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state includes the important relation for `dp[j]`, while `n`, `i`, and `f_max_n` remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is initialized to `f_max_n`; `dp[j]` is updated to be `dp[j] + dp[j - 1]`.**
