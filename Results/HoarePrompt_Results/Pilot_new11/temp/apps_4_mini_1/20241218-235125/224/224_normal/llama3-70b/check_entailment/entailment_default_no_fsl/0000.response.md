To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we'll analyze the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` in relation to the behavior expected for the computation of permutations and their maximum GCD properties.

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the GCD of two non-negative integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function seems to perform correctly as it appropriately computes the GCD. The behavior is as expected, and it meets the requirement that both inputs are non-negative integers.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**: 
   - This function iterates through integers from `1` to `n` and calculates the maximum GCD value we can obtain from the prefixes of permutations of numbers `1` to `n`. However, the logic of `func_2` seems to misunderstand how to compute `f_max(n)`. Specifically, it takes a maximum of GCDs which does not align with the expected distinct values of GCDs in permutations. The distinct GCD values require more careful combinatorial logic related to the permutations themselves.

3. **Function `func_3(n, f_max_n)`**: 
   - This function counts permutations related to the maximum GCD value calculated from `func_2`. There is a significant concern where `f_max_n` might not represent the correct distinct count of GCDs derived from permutations, given that `func_2` doesn't calculate distinct GCDs correctly.

### Key Observations:
- The problem requires counting permutations where `f(p) = f_max(n)`. The result of `func_2` is held in `f_max_n`, but it's based on an incorrect understanding of how many distinct GCD values can be achieved by permutations of numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Example Cases:
- For `n = 2`, we have valid outputs, but the handling breaks down for higher values as `func_2` merely computes GCDs cumulatively rather than evaluating all necessary permutations directly to derive distinct results.
- For `n = 3` and `n = 6`, similar breakdowns will occur owing to miscalculated `f_max_n`, which subsequently affects the results derived in `func_3`.

### Final Evaluation:
The code does not correctly implement the necessary logic for determining the maximum value of `f(p)` and subsequently counting the permutations that achieve this maximum. Thus, it will not provide the correct results for various potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
