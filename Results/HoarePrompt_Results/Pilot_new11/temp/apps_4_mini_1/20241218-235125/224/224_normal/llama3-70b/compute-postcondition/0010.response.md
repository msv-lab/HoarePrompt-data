According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f_max_n`. The loop is structured to iterate from `f_max_n` down to 1. Given that `j` is currently 0 at the end of the last iteration, the next iteration of the loop will decrement `j` by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. 

Given that the loop needs `j` to be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue, we must ensure that `f_max_n` is at least 1. Since we have `j` starting from `f_max_n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `f_max_n` must be at least 2 (allowing `j` to take on the value of 1). 

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `dp[0]` is incremented by `dp[-1]`, `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`**
