The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^6), and `f_max_n`, a non-negative integer (with the constraint f_max_n <= n). It calculates and returns the number of ways to select sums of exactly `f_max_n` using integers from 1 to `n`. 

If `f_max_n` is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns `dp[f_max_n]`, which is the total number of combinations of choosing numbers that sum to `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is 0, the function returns 1, representing the single way to form the sum of 0 (by selecting no numbers). The function maintains the invariant that the computed number of ways to form sums is stored in the list `dp`, indexed by possible sums from 0 to `f_max_n`.

The functionâ€™s logic ensures that valid inputs result in correctly calculated outputs, and it correctly handles two specific edge cases: when `f_max_n` is 0, returning 1, and when `f_max_n` is 1 or more, returning the calculated number of combinations. No missing functionality is identified that would impact the expected behavior as described in the annotations.
