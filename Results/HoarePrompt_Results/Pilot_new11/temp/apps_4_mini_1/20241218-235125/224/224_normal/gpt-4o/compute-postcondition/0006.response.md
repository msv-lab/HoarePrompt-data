`result` is assigned the value of `result * i % mod`. The previous values are: `result` is 6, `i` is 4, and `mod` is 1000000007. 

Calculating: 
`result = 6 * 4 % 1000000007 = 24 % 1000000007 = 24`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 1000000007, `result` is 24, `i` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 1000000007, `result` is 24, `i` is 4.**
