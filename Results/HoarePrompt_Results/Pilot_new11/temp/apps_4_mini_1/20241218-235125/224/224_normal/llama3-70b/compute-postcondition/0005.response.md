The line of code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` suggests that it is updating the value of `dp[j]` by adding to it the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Since there is no specific initial value provided for the `dp` array, we can't define exact values for `dp[j]` or `dp[j - 1]`. The initial values of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` remain unknown. 

However, the execution implies that after this statement, `dp[j]` will be greater than or equal to its previous value, assuming `dp[j - 1]` is at least 0 (which is customary in dynamic programming where these kinds of variables are initialized).  

The variables `n`, `i`, and `f_max_n` remain unchanged because they are not modified by this code. Therefore, the Output State refers to the modified state of `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `i` is 1, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[j]` is now equal to its previous value plus `dp[j - 1]`.**
