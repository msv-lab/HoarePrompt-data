The code `dp[j] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[j]` to be the remainder when `dp[j]` is divided by `MOD`. The value of `j` is initialized to `f_max_n`, so the value of `dp[j]` will change, but the specifics of `MOD` and the value of `dp[j]` before the operation are unknown. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f_max_n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is initialized to `f_max_n`, and `dp[j]` is updated to `dp[j] % MOD`**.
