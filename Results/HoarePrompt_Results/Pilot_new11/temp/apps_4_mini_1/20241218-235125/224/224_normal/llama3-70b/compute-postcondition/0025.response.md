According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Therefore, `i` will become 3. Additionally, since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 10^6, and `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for another iteration to happen, `n` must continue to be greater than or equal to 3. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^6 and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3.**
