#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and mod is an integer representing the modulus value (1000000007).
def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is equal to `n! % mod`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 1000000007.
    return result
    #The program returns result which is equal to n! % mod, where mod is 1000000007
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of an integer `n` (where `2 <= n <= 10^6`) modulo a given modulus value `mod` (defaulting to `1000000007`). It performs a multiplication of integers from `2` to `n`, while continuously taking the modulo to prevent overflow and ensure the result remains within a manageable range. After the calculation, the function returns the value of `n! % mod`. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than `2`, nor does it validate the modulus value, which could be a potential edge case. It's also important to note that the function assumes `mod` will always have a reasonable value to avoid division by zero or negative modulus issues.
