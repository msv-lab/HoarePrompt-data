The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `counts` has at least 3 character keys; `i` is 3; `n` is greater than 3; `result[3]` is equal to `char`; `counts[char]` has increased by 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
