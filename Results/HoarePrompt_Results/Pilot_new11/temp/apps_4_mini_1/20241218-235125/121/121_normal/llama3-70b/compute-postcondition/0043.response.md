The variable `res` is being updated by appending the value of `c`, which is the first character of the string `s`. Since `c` is guaranteed to be a character that is not equal to '?', the output of the variable `res` becomes `res` concatenated with `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?', length of `s` must be greater than 0; `c` is the first character of `s` and is not equal to '?'; `res` is updated to include the character `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', '?', length of `s` must be greater than 0; `c` is the first character of `s` and is not equal to '?'; `res` is updated to `res + c`.**
