Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and `count` is a dictionary with the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' based on their occurrences in `s`. Characters in `s` that are '?' do not affect the counts, and therefore `count` only contains the total occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`.**
