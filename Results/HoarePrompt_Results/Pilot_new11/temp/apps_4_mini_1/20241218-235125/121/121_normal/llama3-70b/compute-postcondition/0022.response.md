Initially, `res` is assigned an empty string. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment, so their values remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `count` is updated such that for each character 'c' in 'ACGT': `count[c]` is equal to \( (n // 4) - \text{original count}[c] \); `avg` is equal to \(n // 4`; `res` is an empty string**.
