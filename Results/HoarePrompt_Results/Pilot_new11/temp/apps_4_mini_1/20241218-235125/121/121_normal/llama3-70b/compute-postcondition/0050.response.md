Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `c` is defined in each iteration of the loop which executes 4 times for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'; `count[nc]` is now reduced by 1, `res` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
