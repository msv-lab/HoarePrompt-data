You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 255, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    s = data[1]
    if (n % 4 != 0) :
        print('===')
        return
        #The program returns nothing as there is no value specified to return.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]` consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `data` is a list created from splitting the input string `s` by whitespace, and `n` is a multiple of 4.
    target_count = n // 4
    counts = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' from string `s`; if `s` is empty, `counts` remains {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}.
    for char in counts:
        if counts[char] > target_count:
            print('===')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary containing counts of 'A': [0 or more], 'C': [0 or more], 'G': [0 or more], 'T': [0 or more]; the loop will execute for each base, and if a count exceeds `target_count`, the function would have returned early. If none exceed, counts remain as counted from the string `s`.
    result = list(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if result[i] == '?':
            for char in counts:
                if counts[char] < target_count:
                    result[i] = char
                    counts[char] += 1
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', each having values between 0 and `target_count`, inclusive. `result` is a list containing the characters assigned based on the respective counts, or it may still have '?' in places where counts have reached `target_count`. If `n` is greater than the number of '?' in the original `result`, the number of characters assigned equals the original number of '?' that were replaced before reaching the limit set by `target_count`. If there were no '?' characters in `result` or if counts for all characters reached `target_count`, then `result` remains unchanged.
    print(''.join(result))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer) and `s` (a string), and may return various outputs including nothing, a message about the count of 'A', None, or a display output '===' based on specific internal conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing as there is no value specified to return.

Case_2: The program returns indicating that the current count of 'A' in `counts` is greater than `target_count`.

Case_3: The program returns None as there is no value specified to return.

Case_4: The program returns nothing, indicated by the output displayed '==='


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
