The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `c` is '?'; `count[nc]` is decremented by 1 if it was greater than 0; `res` remains incremented by `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
