Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` has been fully processed, and `res` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. If there is at least one character remaining in `count` with a non-zero value, the program continues processing. Otherwise, if all counts in `count` are zero, `res` is printed.***
