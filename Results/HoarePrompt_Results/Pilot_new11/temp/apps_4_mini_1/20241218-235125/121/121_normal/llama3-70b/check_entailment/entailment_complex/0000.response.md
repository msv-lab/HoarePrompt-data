Correctness: **True**

The provided program successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for decoding a genome string containing nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') and unrecognized nucleotides represented by '?'.

Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads an integer `n` (which must be between 4 and 255) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?' as specified. This is in line with the requirements of the problem statement.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It counts the occurrences of the nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the input string `s` while ignoring '?' characters. This step is crucial for determining how many of each nucleotide is needed to achieve balance.

3. **Calculating Target Counts**:
   - The program calculates the average count of each nucleotide required (`avg = n // 4`). Given that the total length `n` should be divisible by 4 (since it checks if each nucleotide should appear equally), this calculation aligns with the constraints laid out in the problem.

4. **Determining Required Characters**:
   - It updates the count of what is needed of each nucleotide to achieve the balance by subtracting the current counts from the target average. This is also handled correctly.

5. **Replacing '?' Characters**:
   - The program replaces each '?' in the string with the appropriate nucleotide until the required counts are fulfilled. It iterates through each character in the original string, substituting '?' when possible. 

6. **Final Validation**:
   - After processing the string, the program checks if any counts remain non-zero. If there are any leftover nucleotides needed to balance counts, it prints '===' as required by the problem description. Otherwise, it produces the balanced resulting string.

7. **Output**:
   - The output format adheres to the specifications: Either a balanced string or '===' if not possible.

In conclusion, the logic and steps within the program collectively ensure that the genome string is processed and transformed according to the demands of the problem description. It communicates the right outcomes based on the state of the character counts after attempting to replace '?', validating its adherence and correctness.
