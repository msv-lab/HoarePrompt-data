Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and `c` is the second character in the string `s`. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by `nc`, `count[nc]` is decreased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
