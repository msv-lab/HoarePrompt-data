The code contains a `print` statement, which outputs a specific string to the console. The values of `n`, `s`, and `data` remain unchanged, as this code does not modify any variables. The overall state is not affected apart from the output produced.

Output State: **`n` is equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `s` is a string equal to `data[1]` consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list created from splitting the input string `s` by whitespace, and '===' is printed to the console.**
