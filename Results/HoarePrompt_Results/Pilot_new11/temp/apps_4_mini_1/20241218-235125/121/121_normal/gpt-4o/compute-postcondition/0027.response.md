The code provided only includes a print statement. It does not change the values of any variables or affect the state of the program. Therefore, we simply acknowledge that the print statement outputs a string to the console.

Output State: **`counts` is a dictionary containing 'A': [0 or more], 'C': [0 or more], 'G': [0 or more], 'T': [0 or more]; `char` is 'C'; and the count of `char` in `counts` is less than or equal to `target_count. The string '===' is printed to the console.**
