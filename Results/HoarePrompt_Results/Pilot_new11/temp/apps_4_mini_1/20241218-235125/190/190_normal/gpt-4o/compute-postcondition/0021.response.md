The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to it. Given that `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000 and that `length` is the next element in `a`, we cannot determine the exact values of `length`, `t`, and how they relate to `n`, but we know that this operation will result in `current_cost` being modified based on these values. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (length - (t + 1))`**
