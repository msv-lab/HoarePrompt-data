The code calculates the total cost based on the current list of `sticks` and the median value `mid`. The result of the sum of absolute differences is assigned to `cost`.

Given:
- `n` is an integer equal to the input value (where 1 <= n <= 1000).
- `sticks` is a sorted list of integers.
- `mid` is the value of `sticks[n // 2]`, which is the median of the sorted list of `sticks`.

The new variable `cost` is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each element `x` in `sticks` and the median `mid`.

Since `cost` is the only new variable being created, and it depends on the current values of `sticks` and `mid`, let's outline the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value (where 1 <= n <= 1000); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100; `sticks` is a sorted list of integers; `mid` is the value of `sticks[n // 2]; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences of each stick from `mid`.**
