The annotated program correctly addresses the problem described for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `a`. This aligns with the problem description where it specifies inputs.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The program iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 (as lengths can only be between 1 and 100 according to the problem constraints). For each `t`, it calculates the `current_cost` of modifying each stick length to be "almost good" for that `t`. The logic used in the cost calculation follows the definition of "almost good" given in the problem (where a stick length `a_i` should satisfy `|a_i - t| <= 1`).

3. **Cost Minimization**: The program correctly keeps track of the minimum cost (`min_cost`) and the corresponding value of `t` (`best_t`), ensuring that at the end, the program outputs the optimal `t` and the minimum cost, as required by the problem description.

4. **Output**: The final output statement prints `best_t` and `min_cost`, which aligns with the expected output format.

Since the program adequately fulfills the requirements of the given task, we can conclude that it will work properly for all valid inputs as outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
