According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over a range from 1 to 100, inclusive. For the loop to execute, we need to establish the current state of the variables involved.

The variable `t` is the loop variable that will take values from 1 to 100 during the execution of the loop. Before the loop starts:
- `min_cost` does not have an impact on whether the loop executes. 
- The variable `best_t` starts at -1, and since it will be updated within the loop, its initial value doesn't prevent the loop from executing.

Since `n` is already established as a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and `a` is a list of positive integers meeting the constraints, we are ensured that the loop can run without issues related to these variables.

The state changes involve primarily the loop variable `t`, which will start with the value of 1 at the first iteration. However, we don't need to modify anything in terms of constraints for loop execution.

At the start of the loop:
- `t` should be initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100, `min_cost` is equal to infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
