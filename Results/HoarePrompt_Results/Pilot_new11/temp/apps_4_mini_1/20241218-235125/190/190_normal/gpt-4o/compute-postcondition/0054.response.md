According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range specified for `t`. The loop will execute for each integer value of `t` from 1 to 100 (inclusive). 

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be equal to the last value in the loop range, which is 100. For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` needs to be incremented to 101.

Since `t` is increased by 1 in each iteration and `t` must be less than or equal to 100 for the loop to run again, we find that after the last iteration, `t` is 100.

Thus, in order for the loop to execute again, `t` would need to be greater than 100, which is outside of the defined range. Therefore, for further iterations to occur, `t` is expected to be adjusted accordingly. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is unchanged, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101**
