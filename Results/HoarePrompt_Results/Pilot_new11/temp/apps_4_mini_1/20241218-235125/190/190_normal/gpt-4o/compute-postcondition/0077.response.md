The code assigns the value of `t` to `best_t`. The values of `n`, `a`, `current_cost`, and `min_cost` remain unchanged, while `best_t` now holds the value of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is the cumulative cost based on the relationship of each element in `a` to `t`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is equal to `t`.**
