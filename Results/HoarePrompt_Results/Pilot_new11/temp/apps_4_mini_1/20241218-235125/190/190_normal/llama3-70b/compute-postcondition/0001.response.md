`sticks` is assigned the value of a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the values taken from `input().split()`. The variable `n` is an integer equal to the input value that determines the number of integers in the list `a`, where each integer satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100. This means `sticks` will now hold the values provided in the input as integers. The states of the other variables are not affected, but `sticks` will now contain a list of integers corresponding to the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value (where 1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 100, `sticks` is a list of integers from input.**
