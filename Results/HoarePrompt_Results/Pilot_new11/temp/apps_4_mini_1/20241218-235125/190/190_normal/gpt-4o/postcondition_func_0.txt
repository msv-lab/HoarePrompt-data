The function reads a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. It calculates the minimum cost to adjust the numbers in the list `a` to be centered around an optimal target value `t`, which ranges from 1 to 100. The cost is defined by how much each number in `a` deviates from the range `[t-1, t+1]`. The function identifies the target value `best_t` that yields the minimum adjustment cost (`min_cost`) and prints both `best_t` and `min_cost` at the end. The code does not handle invalid input beyond the stated constraints and does not account for cases where `n` or `a` may be empty or malformed outside the range of the given assumptions.
