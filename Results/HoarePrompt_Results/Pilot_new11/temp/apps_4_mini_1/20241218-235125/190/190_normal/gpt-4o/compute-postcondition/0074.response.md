Given the provided information and the structure of the loop, we can determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed.

The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, which consists of `n` positive integers. For each `length` in `a`, if it meets certain conditions relative to `t`, the `current_cost` is updated accordingly. The conditions check if `length` is less than `t - 1` (100) or greater than `t + 1` (102). 

Based on how the loop is structured, after it executes all iterations for the list `a`, the final state of the variables will be as follows:

- `current_cost` will be the cumulative cost computed based on the values of each `length` in `a` and the fixed value of `t` (101).
- If none of the lengths are less than 100 or greater than 102, `current_cost` will remain unchanged from its initial value of 0.
- The values of `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged as indicated.

**Output State: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is the cumulative cost based on the relationship of each element in `a` to `t`, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged.**
