According to the code, the loop is set to execute as long as the variable `i` is greater than 0. Since `i` is set to `mid - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be decremented by 1. This means that `i` will become `mid - 2` for the next iteration. 

Additionally, `mid` remains unchanged unless other conditions in the code dictate otherwise, which are not specified in this context. 

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration would be as follows: 

State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, `mid` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `mid - 2`**
