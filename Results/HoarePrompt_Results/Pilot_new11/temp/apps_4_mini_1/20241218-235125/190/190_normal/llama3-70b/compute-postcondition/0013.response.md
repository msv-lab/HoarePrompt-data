Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a[i] <= 100), `sticks` is a sorted list of integers, and `mid` is greater than or equal to 1. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `cost`, `min_t` is updated to `mid`, and `i` is set to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `min_cost`, `min_t`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
