The variable `current_cost` is increased by the value of `length - (t + 1)`. Given that `t` is 101 and we know that `length` is greater than 102, we can deduce that `length - (t + 1)` is equivalent to `length - 102`, which is guaranteed to be positive. Therefore, the exact change in `current_cost` will depend on the specific value of `length`, but it will always represent a positive increment.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state will include the updated value of `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 <= `a[i]` <= 100), `current_cost` is increased by `length - 102`, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101, `length` is greater than or equal to 100 and the current value of `length` is greater than 102.**
