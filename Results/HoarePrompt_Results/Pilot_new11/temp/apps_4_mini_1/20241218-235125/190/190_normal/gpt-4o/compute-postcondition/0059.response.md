Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is unchanged, `best_t` is unchanged, `t` is 101, `length` is the first element of `a`, and `length` is greater than or equal to `t - 1` (which means `length` is greater than or equal to 100).***
