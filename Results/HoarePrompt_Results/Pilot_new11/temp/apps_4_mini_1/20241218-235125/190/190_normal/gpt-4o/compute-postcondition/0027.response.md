The variable `best_t` is assigned the value of `t`, which is not provided in the initial state. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `current_cost` is the total adjustment cost based on the differences between each element in `a` and `t`, which is 1, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is equal to `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 <= `a[i]` <= 100, `current_cost` is the total adjustment cost based on the differences between each element in `a` and `t`, which is 1, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is equal to `t`.**
