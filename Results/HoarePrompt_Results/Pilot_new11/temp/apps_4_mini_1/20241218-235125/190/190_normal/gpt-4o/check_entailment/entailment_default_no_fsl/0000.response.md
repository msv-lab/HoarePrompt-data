Correctness: **True**

The provided program solves the problem as described by iterating through all potential target values `t` from 1 to 100. For each `t`, it calculates the total cost required to make all stick lengths "almost good" for that `t`, which is correctly defined as having each length within the range `[t-1, t+1]`. 

The program calculates the cost efficiently by checking if each stick length falls below `t-1` or above `t+1` and totals the necessary adjustments. It correctly keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding `t` that achieves it.

Given the constraints in the problem statement (with `n` up to 1000 and sticks lengths between 1 and 100), the approach is computationally feasible, and the program will always produce valid results for valid inputs.

Since all potential cases outlined in the problem description are handled correctly, including the examples given, the program is indeed correct.
