Explanation: The program correctly computes the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) by summing all positive integers (for \( B \)) and summing all negative integers (for \( C \)), then calculates the difference. The logic correctly handles the given examples and adheres to the problem description, as it ensures that all positive numbers contribute positively to \( B \) and negative numbers are effectively subtracted when calculating \( B - C \). 

Although the output hints mention the lack of input validation, the problem description assumes valid input. Since the code correctly executes for all expected valid input cases outlined in the description, and returns the intended output for the provided examples, we can conclude the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
