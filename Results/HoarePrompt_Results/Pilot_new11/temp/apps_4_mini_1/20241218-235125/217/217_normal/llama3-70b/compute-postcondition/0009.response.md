Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100. If `i` is even, then `b` is equal to `b + a[i]`, `c` remains 0, and `i` remains even. If `i` is odd, then `b` is 0, `c` is updated to `c + a[i]`, and `i` is odd.***
