The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer within the range of 1 to 100, and a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers. Each integer in the list `a` satisfies the constraint of being between -100 and 100, inclusive. The specific output or behavior of the function based on these inputs hasn't been provided. Therefore, without additional information, we can only outline the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` containing `n` integers (each satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100).**
