The `a` list is sorted in reverse order. The previous constraints on `a` were that it contains `n` integers each within the range -100 to 100, and now `a` will be rearranged in descending order. The value of `n` remains the same as it represents the number of elements in list `a`. Therefore, the output state includes the sorted `a` list while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a sorted list of n integers in descending order satisfying -100 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100.**
