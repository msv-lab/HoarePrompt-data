Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the relationship between the counts of bracket pairs correctly in some cases. Specifically, the check `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` does not ensure that the arrangement of the pairs will lead to a valid regular bracket sequence.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
cnt1 = 1
cnt2 = 0
cnt3 = 2
cnt4 = 0
```

This means we have one string "((," two strings "))," and no strings "()" or ")(". The program would output `0`, indicating that it's not possible to create a valid sequence. However, the only strings we have are "(((" which cannot be matched with "))". 

Additionally, there can be cases where the program allows for an invalid sequence due to the insufficient number of opening brackets compared to closing brackets after the arrangement is attempted. 

To summarize, while the given logic might work for specific cases, there are scenarios where it fails to ensure that the brackets can form a correct sequence, thus making the program incorrect.
