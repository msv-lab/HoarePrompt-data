The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to arrange the given bracket sequences into a valid regular bracket sequence. The problem requires assessing relationships among `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, but it only compares `cnt_3` with `cnt_1`. This is insufficient to ascertain the overall balance of `( )` pairs required for a valid sequence.

For example, consider the following scenario:
- If `cnt_1 = 0`, `cnt_2 = 2`, `cnt_3 = 0`, and `cnt_4 = 2`. The output will be `1`, indicating a valid sequence, but in reality, the sequence would just consist of `))`, which is not valid. The strings cannot properly match because you have more closing brackets than opening ones.

Additionally, the program does not account for the `cnt_4` and `cnt_2` in the logic to determine validity; it only relies on one condition that does not encompass all input possibilities.

Thus, there are scenarios where the output does not meet the expectations outlined in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**.
