You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and see if the program satisfies them.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We are given `n` kegs with specified volumes.
2. The Fair Nut wants to pour exactly `s` liters of kvass.
3. The objective is to maximize the minimum amount of kvass left in the least filled keg after pouring `s` liters.
4. If it's impossible to pour `s` liters, the program should output `-1`.

### Program Logic:
Here’s a brief breakdown of what the program does:
- It reads the number of kegs and the desired volume of kvass to pour.
- It reads the volume of each keg and sums them up to check if it is less than `s`. If so, it prints `-1`.
- It sorts the keg volumes and tries to distribute the `s` liters while maximizing the minimum amount left in the least filled keg.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Exact Fill from a Single Keg**: If there is only one keg and it has exactly `s` liters, the output should be `0` after pouring, making sure we can handle this situation.
   
2. **All Kegs Filled to Capacity but Not Enough**:
   - Let’s consider when kegs have volumes `[2, 2, 2]` and the desired volume `s = 5`. This should output `-1` because even though the sum is `6`, the maximum possible minimum volume is `0` which can't be achieved by pouring `5` liters.
   
3. **Not Enough Combined Volume**: If `kegs = [1, 1, 1]` and we desire `s = 5`, we must ensure this returns `-1` since we cannot pour `5` from a total of `3`.

4. **More Liter Wanted Than Available**: If the liters wanted exceeds total liters available, this must also return `-1`.

### Testing the Logic of the Program:
By inspecting further, we might find that the algorithm is not correctly calculating the potential remaining volumes in some edge cases. 

1. For the test case where `n=3` and `s=5` 
   - Volumes: `[2, 2, 2]`, it should return `-1`, but let’s reflect on the program's logic.
  
2. Let’s say for `n=4`, `s=10` with volumes `[3, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, we can take 3 from one keg and 1 from the last keg, we would expect `1` keg left in minimal state.
   
### Identifying an Error Based on Conditions:
After the examination, I can conclude that there is a flaw, especially in how remaining kvass post pouring is evaluated within the loop. For instance, in some edge cases, the logic to compute how much kvass can remain in the least keg does not cover all cases and may lead to incorrect results. 

Therefore, we find cases where outcomes deviate from what is expected according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The code does not adequately address the outlined requirements across the spectrum of scenarios, leading to potential incorrect outputs in certain edge cases.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), s is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), and v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i represents the volume of the i-th keg (1 <= v_i <= 10^9).
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if (total_volume < s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `i` is less than `n`, `remaining_kvass` is the amount of kvass that was not taken from the available volumes; if all `remaining_kvass` was taken, it will be 0, if not it will be greater than 0. `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and greater than or equal to `s`.
        if (remaining_kvass > 0) :
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and `i` is less than `n`. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is updated to `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. If `remaining_kvass` is 0, no changes are made. The `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and greater than or equal to `s.
        print(min_keg_volume)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a list of `n` integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` and `min_keg_volume` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n`, an integer `s`, and a list of integers `volumes`. It checks if the total volume of the kegs is at least `s`. If it is not, the function prints `-1`. If it is, the function calculates the minimum volume that can be obtained from the kegs after attempting to reduce the `remaining_kvass` amount by taking volumes from kegs that exceed the minimum keg volume. If any `remaining_kvass` remains after processing all eligible kegs, it adjusts the minimum keg volume downwards based on the amount of remaining kvass and the number of kegs. The final result printed is either the updated minimum keg volume or, if all `remaining_kvass` was taken, the original minimum keg volume. The function directly interacts with user input and output, returning no values but printing results instead.
