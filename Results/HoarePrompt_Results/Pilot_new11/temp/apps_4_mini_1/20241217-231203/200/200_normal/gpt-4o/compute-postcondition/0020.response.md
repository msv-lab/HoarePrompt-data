The code `continue` causes the program to skip the remainder of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. There is no change to the values of the variables, and the program will continue executing from the start of the loop with the same values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `remaining_kvass` is the same, and `volumes[i]` must be greater than `min_keg_volume` if applicable, and the loop iteration continues.**
