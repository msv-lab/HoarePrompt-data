The list `v` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and the integer `n` still satisfies the condition 1 <= `n` <= 1000. The list `v` is now sorted, but without specific values for its elements, we can only describe its state as sorted.

Output State: **`s` is an input positive integer, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v[i]` satisfies 1 <= `v[i]` <= 10^9.**
