Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `s` is a non-negative integer (1 <= s <= 10^12), `v` is a list of `n` integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)`. If `total_volume` is less than `s`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is updated by subtracting `(remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n` and `min_keg_volume` is printed.***
