According to the provided code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know that `total_volume` is equal to the sum of `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`, which is relevant to the conditions in the loop. Since `i` will start at 0 in the first iteration, the states to be adjusted involve defining what `i` will be at the beginning of the loop.

To summarize, the necessary conditions are:
- `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- Initially, `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
