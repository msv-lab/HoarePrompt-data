`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high + 1) // 2`. Given that `low` must be less than `high`, `mid` will be calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low`, `high`, and `1`. The values of `total`, `s`, and `min(v)` remain unchanged and still hold their valid conditions.

Output State: **`total` is less than or equal to `s`, `low` must be less than `high`, `min(v)` must be greater than 1; `mid` is equal to `(low + high + 1) // 2`.**
