Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) and `i` is less than `n`. If `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0, `min_keg_volume` is updated to `min_keg_volume - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`. If `remaining_kvass` is 0, no changes are made. The `volumes` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `total_volume` is equal to `sum(volumes)` and greater than or equal to `s.***
