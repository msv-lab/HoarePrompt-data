Postcondition: ***`s` is an input positive integer, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000, and `v` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `v[i]` satisfies 1 <= `v[i]` <= 10^9. If the `total` is less than `s`, then `low` is set to (min(v) + 1) // 2, `high` is min(v), `mid` is (min(v) + 1) // 2, and `total` is equal to the sum of the minimum of (min(v) + 1) // 2 and each `x` in `v`. Otherwise, if `total` is greater than or equal to `s`, `low` is set to 0, `high` is (min(v) + 1) // 2 - 1, and `mid` remains (min(v) + 1) // 2, with `total` being greater than or equal to `s`.***
