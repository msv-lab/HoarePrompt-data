To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to evaluate the variables involved in the `for` loop. 

The loop iterates over `digits`, which is a list of integers. For the loop to execute, `digits` must be a non-empty list. Additionally, the loop iterates over `digit`, which means `digit` will take on each value from the `digits` list during the iterations.

1. **`digits` needs to be a non-empty list:** For the loop to execute at least once, there must be at least one integer in the `digits` list.
2. **`decimal_value` can remain 0:** The initial value of `decimal_value` does not affect the execution of the loop but may be used within the loop body.

Based on this analysis, for the loop to be executed properly, we require:

- `digits` must be a non-empty list.
- The variable `digit` will represent the first element of the `digits` list in the first iteration.

State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is 0, `digit` is the first element of `digits`**
