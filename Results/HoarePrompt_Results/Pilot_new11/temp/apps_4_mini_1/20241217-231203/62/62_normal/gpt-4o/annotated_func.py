#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specific base, and base is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40. The digits must be in the range of 0 to base-1 and must not contain leading zeroes.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digits` is a non-empty list of integers; `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40; `decimal_value` is equal to the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in the list `digits` in the specified `base`.
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns the decimal representation of the number formed by the digits in the list 'digits' in the specified 'base', which is an integer between 2 and 40.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits` representing the digits of a number in a given `base` (ranging from 2 to 40) and returns the equivalent decimal representation of that number as an integer. The function assumes that the input list `digits` is non-empty, contains valid digits in the range of 0 to base-1, and does not contain leading zeroes. It calculates the decimal value by iterating through the list of digits and converting them from the specified base to decimal. However, if the input `digits` contains invalid digits or if it is empty (despite the assumption), the function does not handle these potential edge cases explicitly, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
