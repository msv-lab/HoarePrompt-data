Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are positive integers such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, 1 <= `M`, and 1 <= `L`. If `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`, then the function continues its execution normally. Otherwise, -1 has been printed to the console.***
