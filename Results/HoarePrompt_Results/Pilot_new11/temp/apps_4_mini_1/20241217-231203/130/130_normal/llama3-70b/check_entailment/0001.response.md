Correctness: **False**

The provided program has issues with handling certain edge cases. 

1. The condition `M >= N - K + 1` checks if the number of friends `M` can provide enough distinct coins given Ivan's existing collection size `K`. However, this condition should also ensure that the friends can provide at least `L` new coins, which is checked separately.

2. The logic fails in scenarios where the total number of distinct coins `N` and the existing coins `K` don’t allow for enough unique new coins to satisfy both `M` friends and `L` new collectibles. 

For example, if we take the input:
```
Input:
3 2 2 2
```
- Here, `N = 3`, `M = 2`, `K = 2`, and `L = 2`.
- Ivan has 2 out of 3 coins, meaning he can only receive 1 new coin from his friends. But he needs 2 new coins (due to `L = 2`) – therefore, it's impossible for his friends to give him the required distinct and new coins.
  
Currently, the output from the program would be "1" since `M >= N - K + 1` (2 >= 2) is true, silently ignoring the fact that he cannot actually reach 2 new coins due to insufficient distinct coin options.

Thus, the program incorrectly prints a number when it should return `-1`, making it incorrect for the given problem description.
