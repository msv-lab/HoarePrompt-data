Functionality: **The function reads four positive integers, N, M, K, and L from the standard input, which must adhere to the constraints 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18. It calculates the minimum number of groups, `min_x`, required to satisfy the condition that the total quantity represented by L can be divided among M without exceeding the available resource of N minus K. If `M * min_x` (the required total) does not exceed `N - K`, it prints `min_x`. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that it is not possible to allocate the resources as required. After execution, the state of the program includes the variables N, M, K, and L remaining unchanged, but min_x being either a calculated number or the value -1 based on the conditions. Edge cases such as maximum allowable values for these integers and scenarios where L is 0 or less than M are not directly handled, potentially leading to incorrect assertions about feasibility.**
