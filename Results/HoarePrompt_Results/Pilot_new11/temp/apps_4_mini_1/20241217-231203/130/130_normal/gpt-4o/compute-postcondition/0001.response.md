The variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are assigned new integer values from the input. The initial state provides that all these variables are positive integers, and the requirements on their ranges (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18) remain valid after the assignment from the input.

The previous values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are now replaced by the values parsed from the input string. 

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are assigned new positive integer values from the input such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ M, L ≤ 10^18.**
