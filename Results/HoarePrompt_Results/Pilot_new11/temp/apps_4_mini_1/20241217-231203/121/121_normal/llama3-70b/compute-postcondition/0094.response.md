Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 4 and 255) and a string `s` of length `n` made up of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It counts occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string while ignoring '?' characters. It calculates the average count of each valid character as `avg = n // 4`. Then, for each '?', it replaces it with a valid character from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the required count calculated earlier. After processing, if any character still needs to be added (i.e., if `count` has any remaining values greater than zero), it prints '===', indicating an incomplete formation. Otherwise, it outputs the fully formed string `res`, which contains all '?' replaced. The function ensures that the resulting string contains characters distributed evenly as much as possible; however, there is no validation for the input beyond the expected format. The function doesn't handle scenarios where input is not as expected or where it cannot fully replace all '?' due to excess required characters.**
