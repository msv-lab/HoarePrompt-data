Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that were replaced with valid characters from `counts` plus 2, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` includes 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with values equal to or greater than `target_count`, `char` is the first character in `counts`, and the current value of `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`.***
