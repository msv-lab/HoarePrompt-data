Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that were replaced with valid characters from `counts` plus 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` has all characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' with values equal to or greater than `target_count`. If `result[i]` is '?', it is replaced with characters from `counts` that correspond to valid replacements.***
