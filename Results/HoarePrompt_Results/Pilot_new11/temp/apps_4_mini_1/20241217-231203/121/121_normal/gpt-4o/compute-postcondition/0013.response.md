Postcondition: ***`n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is equal to `data[1]`, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` is {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}. If `char` (the first character in `s`) is in `counts`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, making `counts[char]` equal to 1. If `char` is not in `counts`, then `counts` remains unchanged.***
