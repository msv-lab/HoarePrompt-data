You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw that can lead to incorrect results. To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
8
??AG??CT
```

In this case, the string length `n` is 8, meaning that each nucleotide of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' should appear exactly 2 times. 

The counts for the given input are:
- 'A': 1
- 'C': 1
- 'G': 1
- 'T': 1
- '?': 4

Currently, we have one of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and we need to replace the 4 question marks. The program will set `avg` to `2`, expecting each nucleotide to appear twice. 

After calculating the required counts, we find that the count dictionary becomes:
- 'A': 1 (needs 1 more)
- 'C': 1 (needs 1 more)
- 'G': 1 (needs 1 more)
- 'T': 1 (needs 1 more)

The algorithm will then attempt to fill the `?` marks with the nucleotides. 
As it processes the first `?`, it will replace it with 'A' (reducing its needed count to 0), for the next `?` it will replace with 'C', then for the next with 'G', and finally the last with 'T'. 

The processed result would become `ACGACTCT`, which is not a valid decoding because the nucleotide counts would be:
- 'A': 2
- 'C': 2
- 'G': 2
- 'T': 1 (missing)

This incorrect filling does not accurately manage the condition that each nucleotide must occur an equal number of times in the final output, leading to a failure to produce a valid genomic string in cases where it becomes indistinct due to unrecognized nucleotides (i.e., `?`).

Thus, the program fails to ensure that the decoded genome has equal counts for all nucleotides. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description's requirements fully and should return "===" in this case.

The existence of this counterexample indicates the program's failure in certain scenarios. Hence, the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `n` (between 4 and 255) and a string `s` of length `n` made up of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. It counts occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the string while ignoring '?' characters. It calculates the average count of each valid character as `avg = n // 4`. Then, for each '?', it replaces it with a valid character from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the required count calculated earlier. After processing, if any character still needs to be added (i.e., if `count` has any remaining values greater than zero), it prints '===', indicating an incomplete formation. Otherwise, it outputs the fully formed string `res`, which contains all '?' replaced. The function ensures that the resulting string contains characters distributed evenly as much as possible; however, there is no validation for the input beyond the expected format. The function doesn't handle scenarios where input is not as expected or where it cannot fully replace all '?' due to excess required characters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
