Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to the number of characters in `s` that were replaced with valid characters from `counts`, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, and `counts` has all of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' values equal to or greater than `target_count`. If `result[i]` is a '?', then `result` contains the characters of `s` with '?' replaced by characters from `counts`.***
