The value of `data` is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which means it will be a list that contains the elements of the string `input` split by whitespace. The previous values of `n` and `s` are not directly affected, but the string `s` is used in conjunction with the input. Since `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and `s` is a string of length `n`, the specific values of `data` will depend on the input provided at runtime.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**
