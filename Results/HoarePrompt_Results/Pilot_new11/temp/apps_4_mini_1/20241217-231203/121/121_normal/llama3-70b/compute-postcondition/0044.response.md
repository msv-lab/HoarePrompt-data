Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` where `n` is greater than 0. If `c` is '?', then `count` contains valid counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' corresponding to how many characters replaced the '?' in `s`, `res` is a string formed by concatenating the characters added in place of '?', and `c` remains '?' if no '?' were replaced, or reflects the last character added in `res` if one or more '?' were replaced. Otherwise, if `c` is not '?', then `count` contains values derived from the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `res` equals `c`, and `c` is the first character in `s`.***
