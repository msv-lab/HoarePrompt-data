The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `s` is a non-empty string; `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`; `counts[char]` is now equal to the previous value plus 1 (but still less than or equal to `target_count`); `result[i]` is set to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
