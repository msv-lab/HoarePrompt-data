The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly handle cases where `n` is not divisible by 4. After analyzing the annotations and understanding how the program operates, it's clear that the program computes `avg = n // 4` correctly and uses this to determine how many of each nucleotide is needed.

However, the original assessment indicates a flawed reasoning. The program inherently handles the case where `n` is not divisible by 4 when checking if `count` has any remaining positive values after replacing '?'. If `n` is not divisible by 4, `avg` will not lead to an exact distribution of nucleotides. Thus, the program will correctly print `===` if there are any nucleotides remaining that haven't found a replacement after processing all '?'.

After evaluating the provided annotated states, they clearly document that the program correctly counts the nucleotides, calculates how many more of each are needed, and replaces the '?' while checking for completeness.

Therefore, the original assessment fails to recognize that the program, by virtue of its final check (`if any(count.values())`), will already output the correct response based on the situation.

Final: **True**
