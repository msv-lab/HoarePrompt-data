The code `print('===')` outputs a string "===" but does not change any of the variable states or values. The variables remain unchanged since no assignments or modifications are made. 

Output State: **`n` is equal to `int(data[0])`, `s` is a non-empty string, `target_count` is equal to `n // 4`, `counts` must contain at least one of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' based on the content of `s`, and for every character `char`, `counts[char]` is less than or equal to `target_count`, and it must have at least 1 character remaining that has not yet been processed.**
