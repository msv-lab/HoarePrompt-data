Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the number of unrecognized nucleotides `'?'` is insufficient to balance out the recognized nucleotides to achieve equality among the four types (`'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, `'T'`). 

Hereâ€™s a case that demonstrates the issue:

Input:
```
8
AA??TGCT
```

Expected behavior:
1. Count of nucleotides in the input is:
   - `'A'`: 2 
   - `'C'`: 1
   - `'G'`: 1
   - `'T'`: 1
   - `'?'`: 2
2. Target count for each nucleotide type is `n // 4 = 2`.
3. The program should replace the `?` characters with nucleotides in such a way that the counts of each nucleotide become equal.

However, the program incorrectly assumes it can just keep replacing `?` until the counts are equal without verifying if there are enough `?` to do so. In this case, we need two more `'C'` nucleotides but only have two `?`, meaning it can't be solved.

Thus, since it doesn't account for the unsufficiency of `?` to balance the nucleotides in all cases, the program fails to be correct for all potential inputs.
