Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw that can lead to incorrect results. To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
8
??AG??CT
```

In this case, the string length `n` is 8, meaning that each nucleotide of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' should appear exactly 2 times. 

The counts for the given input are:
- 'A': 1
- 'C': 1
- 'G': 1
- 'T': 1
- '?': 4

Currently, we have one of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and we need to replace the 4 question marks. The program will set `avg` to `2`, expecting each nucleotide to appear twice. 

After calculating the required counts, we find that the count dictionary becomes:
- 'A': 1 (needs 1 more)
- 'C': 1 (needs 1 more)
- 'G': 1 (needs 1 more)
- 'T': 1 (needs 1 more)

The algorithm will then attempt to fill the `?` marks with the nucleotides. 
As it processes the first `?`, it will replace it with 'A' (reducing its needed count to 0), for the next `?` it will replace with 'C', then for the next with 'G', and finally the last with 'T'. 

The processed result would become `ACGACTCT`, which is not a valid decoding because the nucleotide counts would be:
- 'A': 2
- 'C': 2
- 'G': 2
- 'T': 1 (missing)

This incorrect filling does not accurately manage the condition that each nucleotide must occur an equal number of times in the final output, leading to a failure to produce a valid genomic string in cases where it becomes indistinct due to unrecognized nucleotides (i.e., `?`).

Thus, the program fails to ensure that the decoded genome has equal counts for all nucleotides. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description's requirements fully and should return "===" in this case.

The existence of this counterexample indicates the program's failure in certain scenarios. Hence, the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.
