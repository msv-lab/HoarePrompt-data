Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n-1`, if `c` is equal to '?', then `count` has been decremented accordingly for each character in `res` and `res` contains at most `k` characters from {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}. Otherwise, `count` remains valid, and `res` includes all previously replaced characters concatenated with `c`, where `c` is the next character in the string `s` and is not equal to '?'***
