Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` greater than 0, `count` contains valid counts for 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where `count['C']` remains unchanged or greater than 0. If `count[nc]` was greater than 0, then `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, `res` is updated to the previous value concatenated with `nc`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
