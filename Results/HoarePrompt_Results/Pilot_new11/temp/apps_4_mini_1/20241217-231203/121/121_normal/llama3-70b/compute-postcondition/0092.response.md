Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n`, where all '?' have been replaced by valid characters from 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'; `count` reflects the original counts minus those used to replace '?'; `res` contains the complete valid string formed from `s`; `c` is the last character processed from `s`. If at least one of the values in `count` is greater than 0, '===' has been printed. If all values of `count` are 0, the output of the print statement is `res`.***
