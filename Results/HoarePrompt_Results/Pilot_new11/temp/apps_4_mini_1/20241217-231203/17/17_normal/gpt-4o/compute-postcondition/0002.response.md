`cnt_3` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `cnt_3` is specified to be an integer such that \(0 \leq cnt_3 \leq 10^9\), the output state reflects the valid range for `cnt_3`, while keeping the previous information for the other variables intact.

Output State: **`cnt_1` is an input integer, `cnt_2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer in the range [0, 10^9], `cnt_4` is an integer such that 0 <= `cnt_4` <= 10^9.**
