You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string is called bracket sequence if it does not contain any characters other than "(" and ")". A bracket sequence is called regular if it it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, "", "(())" and "()()" are regular bracket sequences; "))" and ")((" are bracket sequences (but not regular ones), and "(a)" and "(1)+(1)" are not bracket sequences at all.

You have a number of strings; each string is a bracket sequence of length $2$. So, overall you have $cnt_1$ strings "((", $cnt_2$ strings "()", $cnt_3$ strings ")(" and $cnt_4$ strings "))". You want to write all these strings in some order, one after another; after that, you will get a long bracket sequence of length $2(cnt_1 + cnt_2 + cnt_3 + cnt_4)$. You wonder: is it possible to choose some order of the strings you have such that you will get a regular bracket sequence? Note that you may not remove any characters or strings, and you may not add anything either.


-----Input-----

The input consists of four lines, $i$-th of them contains one integer $cnt_i$ ($0 \le cnt_i \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print one integer: $1$ if it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence by choosing the correct order of the given strings, $0$ otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1
4
3

Output
1

Input
0
0
0
0

Output
1

Input
1
2
3
4

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example it is possible to construct a string "(())()(()((()()()())))", which is a regular bracket sequence.

In the second example it is possible to construct a string "", which is a regular bracket sequence.
Program:
```
def func():
    cnt1 = int(input())
    cnt2 = int(input())
    cnt3 = int(input())
    cnt4 = int(input())
    if cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt2 >= cnt3:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases for forming a regular bracket sequence. Specifically, it fails when considering the constraints that need to be satisfied for combinations of the different types of bracket strings.

For example, if we take the input:

```
1
0
0
1
```

Here, `cnt1 = 1` (one string of "(("), `cnt2 = 0` (no strings of "()"), `cnt3 = 0` (no strings of ")("), and `cnt4 = 1` (one string of "))"). According to the program's logic:

- `cnt1 + cnt2` = `1 + 0` = `1`
- `cnt3 + cnt4` = `0 + 1` = `1`

The first condition `cnt1 + cnt2 == cnt3 + cnt4` evaluates to `True`. However, the condition `cnt2 >= cnt3` evaluates to `True` (since `0 >= 0` is `True`). The program would print `1`, indicating that a regular bracket sequence can be formed, which is incorrect.

The correct conclusion is that we cannot form a valid bracket sequence from the input given, as we have an opening string "((" and a closing string "))", which cannot yield a valid sequence. Thus, the expected output should be `0`.

This contradiction illustrates that the program does not handle this case correctly â€” it incorrectly allows an unbalanced string formation.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integer inputs from the user and checks whether the sum of the first two integers equals the sum of the last two integers, while also verifying that the second integer is greater than or equal to the third integer. It outputs `1` if both conditions are true; otherwise, it outputs `0`. The function does not return any values or accept any parameters, and it only interacts with the user through console input and output. Additionally, the function accepts inputs in the range of `0` to `10^9`, but does not handle invalid inputs or any exceptions that may arise from this. This means that if the user enters non-integer values, the function will throw an error, which is a missing functionality in terms of input validation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
