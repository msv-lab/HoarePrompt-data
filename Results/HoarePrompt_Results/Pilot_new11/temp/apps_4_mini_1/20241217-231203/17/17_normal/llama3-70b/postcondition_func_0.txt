The function reads four non-negative integers (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) from user input, which must be within the range of 0 to 10^9. It evaluates whether cnt3 is greater than cnt1. If cnt3 is greater, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1. The function does not modify cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, or cnt4, and there are no return values. The function primarily serves to output a binary response based on this comparison. Additionally, there are unspecified behaviors for handling edge cases, such as invalid input or cases where cnt3 equals cnt1.
