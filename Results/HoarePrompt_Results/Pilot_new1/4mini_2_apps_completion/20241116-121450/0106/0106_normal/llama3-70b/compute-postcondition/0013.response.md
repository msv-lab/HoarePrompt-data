The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`, with the condition that `a` is not equal to `b`. 

The function's output is dependent on these values and their relationships. Since the specific output cases are not provided, we can summarize the expected behavior based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on positive integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and apartment numbers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b) and returns a result based on these inputs.**
