The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned from the input, which is processed by `map(int, input().split())`. Since the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, they will be assigned specific integer values based on the input provided. The values of `a` and `b` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` as positive integers, and the previous values of `a` and `b` are retained.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers from input; `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b**
