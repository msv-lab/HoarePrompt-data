To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet.

The code calculates the value of `block` based on the formula:
```
block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

In this formula:
- `apartment` is not defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a positive integer within the range of `1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k`.
- `m` and `k` are positive integers as stated in the initial conditions.

Since the specific values of `apartment`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not given, we cannot compute an exact value for `block`. However, we can describe the relationship and how `block` is derived from `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the relationship among the variables, stating that `block` is determined by the formula involving `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
