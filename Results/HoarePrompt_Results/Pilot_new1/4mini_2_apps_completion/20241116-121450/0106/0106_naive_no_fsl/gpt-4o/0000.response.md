To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The program is designed to compute the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment in a multi-story, multi-entrance building. Here's a breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Location Calculation**: The function `get_location` computes which entrance (block) and floor an apartment is located in, based on its number. This is done using integer division and modulus operations.

2. **Time to Exit**: The time to exit the building from Edward's apartment is computed. If he is already on the first floor, the time is 0. If he is on a higher floor, it takes 10 seconds for the elevator to arrive and then a number of seconds equal to the number of floors he needs to descend.

3. **Walking Time Calculation**: The program calculates the time it takes to walk directly to Natasha's block and also the time it would take if he walked in the reverse direction. The minimum of these two times is stored.

4. **Time to Target Floor**: After reaching the correct block, it computes the time needed to ascend to Natasha's floor.

5. **Total Time Calculation**: Finally, it sums up the time to exit, the walking time, and the time to reach the target floor to get the total time.

### Potential Cases

Let's analyze potential cases to find if there are any scenarios where the program may fail:

- **Case 1**: If Edward is on the first floor and Natasha is on the first floor of a different block. The program should compute the walking time, but it should not add any elevator time since he would not need to use it. The program handles this correctly.

- **Case 2**: If Edward is on the last floor of his block and Natasha is on the first floor of the next block. The elevator time is calculated correctly, and the walking time is also considered. The program handles this correctly.

- **Case 3**: If Edward and Natasha are in blocks that are directly next to each other, and both are on the same floor. The program should calculate the walking time correctly without any elevator time. The program handles this correctly.

- **Case 4**: If Edward is at the very last apartment in the last block and Natasha is at the first apartment in the first block. The program should compute the time correctly, including the wrap-around of blocks. The program handles this correctly.

### Conclusion

After carefully analyzing the logic and considering edge cases, it appears that the program correctly computes the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha in all scenarios described in the problem statement. 

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
