The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified, but they are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. Other variables (`a` and `b`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` as positive integers based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on user input; `a` and `b` remain distinct integers within the range of 1 to n·m·k**
