Functionality: ** The function accepts input values for positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as two distinct integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the time required to move between the blocks and floors represented by `a` and `b` in a building with `n` blocks, each containing `m` floors, with `k` units per block. The total time is computed based on the difference in blocks multiplied by 15 and the difference in floors multiplied by 5, with a base transition time of 10. The function prints the total time required for the transition. **
