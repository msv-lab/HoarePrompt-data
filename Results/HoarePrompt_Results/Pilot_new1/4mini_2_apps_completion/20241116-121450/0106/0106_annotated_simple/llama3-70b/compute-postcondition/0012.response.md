Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`. The result of `min_block_time + min_floor_time` is printed.**
