The variable `a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on user input, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, we can only express `a_block` in terms of these variables. The other variables `n`, `b`, and `a_floor` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on user input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers based on user input; `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
