The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates with the following constraints: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with the defined constraints on `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` without taking them as direct inputs.

Functionality: **The function operates with positive integers n, m, and k within the range of 1 to 1000, and distinct integers a and b within the range of 1 to n·m·k, but does not accept parameters directly.**
