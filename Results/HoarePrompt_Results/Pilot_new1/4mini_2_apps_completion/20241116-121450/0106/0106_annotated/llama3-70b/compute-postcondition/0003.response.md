To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. The variable `a_block` is assigned the value of the expression `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
2. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are needed to compute `a_block`, but they are not provided in the initial state.
3. The initial state mentions that `a_floor` is calculated as `((a - 1) % m) + 1`, which indicates that `a` and `m` are defined, but their specific values are not provided.

Since we cannot determine the specific value of `a_block` without knowing `a`, `m`, and `k`, we can only state that `a_block` is calculated based on these variables.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a_block` is defined but cannot be evaluated to a specific number due to the unknown values of `a`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`a_floor` is calculated as ((`a` - 1) % `m`) + 1; `a_block` is defined as (`a` - 1) // (`m` * `k`) + 1, but cannot be evaluated without specific values for `a`, `m`, and `k`.**
