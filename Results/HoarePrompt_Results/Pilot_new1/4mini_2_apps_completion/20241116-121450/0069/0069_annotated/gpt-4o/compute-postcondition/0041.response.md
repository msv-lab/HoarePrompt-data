Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1; if `x` is not present, `results` includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` includes this `count`. This accounts for all possible values of `x` and ensures that edge cases where `x` equals the first or last element of `prefix_balances` are considered.***
