The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is 1, so `s` will take the value of `data[3]`. The values of `T`, `results`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the value of `data[3]` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`**
