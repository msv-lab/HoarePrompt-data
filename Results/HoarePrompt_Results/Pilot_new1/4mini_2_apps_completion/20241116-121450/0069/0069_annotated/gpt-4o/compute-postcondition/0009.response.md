The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables (`T`, `results`, `n`, `x`, and `s`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`**
