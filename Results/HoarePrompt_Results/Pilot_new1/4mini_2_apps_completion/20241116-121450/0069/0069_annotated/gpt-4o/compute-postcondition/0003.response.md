The value of `index` is assigned the value 1. The variables `T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100); `n`, `x`, `s`, and `data` are unchanged; `index` is 1.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100); `n`, `x`, `s`, and `data` are unchanged; `index` is 1**
