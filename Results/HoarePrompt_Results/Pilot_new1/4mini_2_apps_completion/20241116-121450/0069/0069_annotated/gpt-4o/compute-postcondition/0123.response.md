The code prints the value of `result`, which is the third element in the list `results`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0 and `results` contains at least 3 elements, so `result` will have a valid value. The print statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `n` is greater than 0, `results` contains at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in `results`, and the value of `result` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `results` contains at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in `results`, and the value of `result` has been printed**.
