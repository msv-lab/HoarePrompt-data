Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `prefix_balances[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length `1`.**
