The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous state of the variables is not affected, but the `results` list is modified to include the new value. The values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1**
