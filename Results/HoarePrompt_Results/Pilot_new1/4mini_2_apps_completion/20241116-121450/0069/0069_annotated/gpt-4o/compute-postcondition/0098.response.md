The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The initial state indicates that `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and `balance` is equal to `0`. The value of `n` is such that the loop does not execute, so `prefix_balances` is not affected. The variable `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and thus does not influence the outcome. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new value added to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` remains unchanged (all zeros), `balance` is 0, `n` is 0 or lower, and `results` now contains an additional element 0**.
