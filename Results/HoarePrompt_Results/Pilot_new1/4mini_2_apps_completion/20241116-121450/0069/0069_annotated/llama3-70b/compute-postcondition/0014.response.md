Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`, which is between 2 and 100001. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1` and `balance` is not equal to `x`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that the values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` do not lead to division by zero and that the relationship between `x` and `balance` is properly maintained throughout.***
