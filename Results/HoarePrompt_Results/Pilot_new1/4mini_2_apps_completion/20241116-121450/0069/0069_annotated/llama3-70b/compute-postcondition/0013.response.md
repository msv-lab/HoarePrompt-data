Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that the condition `balance` is not equal to `x` is maintained throughout. The postcondition handles cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, and thus the division is valid, while also considering the scenario when `cnt0` is greater than `cnt1`, or vice versa, ensuring that the output is consistent with the mathematical operations defined.***
