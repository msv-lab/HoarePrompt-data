The code attempts to print `n + 1`, but the value of `n` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the output of `print(n + 1)`. The values of `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `n` is not defined**.
