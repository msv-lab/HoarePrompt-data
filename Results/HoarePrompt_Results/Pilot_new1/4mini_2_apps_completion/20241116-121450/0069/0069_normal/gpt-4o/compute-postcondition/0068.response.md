Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 or 1. If the expression `(x - b) % balance == 0` is true and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that `x - b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0. Additionally, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 balance, and `b` is the first balance in `prefix_balances`.***
