Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, then `results` contains the printed values of its elements, and the loop executes `n` times, printing each element in `results`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `results` is empty, the loop will not execute, and nothing will be printed.**
