Output State: **`results` contains the counts of valid indices based on the conditions applied to `prefix_balances` and `balance`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1; if not, it includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` reflects the number of valid indices where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. The loop executes `T` times, and if `data` does not have enough elements for `T`, it may lead to an index error. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and `results` will remain unchanged.**
