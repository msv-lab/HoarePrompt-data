Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance after processing the first `i` characters of `s`. The balance is not equal to 0, indicating that the cumulative balance after processing the characters of `s` is either positive or negative. If `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`, and subsequent values are updated based on the characters processed. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
