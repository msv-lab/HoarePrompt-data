According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`, meaning it will execute a total of `n` times. The variable `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`, and `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to have executed at least once.

Given that `prefix_balances[1]` is either `prefix_balances[0] + 1` or `prefix_balances[0] - 1`, we don't need to adjust `prefix_balances[0]` since it remains unchanged, but we need to ensure that `prefix_balances[1]` is correctly defined based on the last value of `prefix_balances[0]`.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to update `i` to `n + 1`.

State: **`prefix_balances[0]` is unchanged; `prefix_balances[1]` is either `prefix_balances[0] + 1` or `prefix_balances[0] - 1`; `i` is `n + 1`**
