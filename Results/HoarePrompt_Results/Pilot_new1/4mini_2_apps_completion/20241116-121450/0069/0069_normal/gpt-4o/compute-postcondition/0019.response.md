Output State: **`prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to each index from 1 to n, where `prefix_balances[i]` is either the previous balance plus 1 (if `s[i - 1]` is '0') or the previous balance minus 1 (if `s[i - 1]` is '1'). If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all 0s.**
