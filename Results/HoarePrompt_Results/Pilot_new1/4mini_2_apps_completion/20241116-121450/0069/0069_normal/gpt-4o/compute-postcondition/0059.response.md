The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of `prefix_balances` and `x` are not affected by this operation, and since `n` does not affect this specific line of code, the state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, `results` is updated to include -1, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, `results` is updated to include -1, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances**
