The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data` is a list containing input values split by whitespace, and `index` is 1. Therefore, `data[index + 1]` refers to the second element in the list `data`. Since `data[1]` is already defined as `n`, the value of `data[index + 1]` will be the value at `data[2]`.

The other variables `T`, `n`, `s`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `x` based on the input from `data`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value from `data[2]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list**.
