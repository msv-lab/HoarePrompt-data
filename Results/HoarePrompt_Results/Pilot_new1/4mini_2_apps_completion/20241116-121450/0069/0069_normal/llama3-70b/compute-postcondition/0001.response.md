To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop and their states:

1. The loop will execute `T` times, which means `T` must be a positive integer (as stated).
2. The loop body will execute for each iteration, but since we don't have the loop body, we focus on the loop control variable (the underscore `_` in this case).
3. The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python, indicating that its value is not needed after the loop execution. However, it still needs to be initialized for each iteration of the loop.
4. Since the loop is controlled by `T`, we need to ensure that it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `T` is already a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), we confirm that `T` is valid for the loop execution. The loop will iterate from 0 to T-1, meaning that there will be `T` iterations.

The variable `_` is implicitly initialized in each iteration of the loop, so no specific value is required for it before the loop starts.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are minimal. We only need to confirm the conditions for `T`:

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100)**
