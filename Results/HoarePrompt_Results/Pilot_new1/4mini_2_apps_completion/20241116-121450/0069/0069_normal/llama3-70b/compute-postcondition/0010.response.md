The code executes a print statement that outputs -1. This does not affect the values of the variables `T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, or `balance`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the output is -1.**
