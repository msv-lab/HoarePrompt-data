The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at `s[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, we are looking at `prefix_balances[2]`. The value of `prefix_balances[1]` is needed for this calculation, and the value of `s[1]` (which corresponds to `s[i - 1]`) will determine whether we add 1 or subtract 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `prefix_balances[2]` based on the calculation. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and `s[i - 1]`; `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged**
