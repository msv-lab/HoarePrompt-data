Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `balance` is the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in `s`, `results` contains at least one element. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then `0` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, the count of valid indices `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` is calculated and appended to `results`. In both cases, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is assigned from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned from `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.***
