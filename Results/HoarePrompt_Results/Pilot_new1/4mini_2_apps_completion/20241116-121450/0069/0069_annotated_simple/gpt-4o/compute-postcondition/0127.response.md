Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a binary string and two integers. It calculates the balance of zeros and ones in the string and builds a prefix sum array to determine how many times a specific condition related to the balance and a target integer can be satisfied. If the overall balance is zero and the target integer is found in the prefix sums, it returns -1; if not found, it returns 0. If the balance is not zero, it counts how many valid prefix sums exist that can satisfy the equation involving the target integer and returns that count. If no test cases are provided, the function will not output anything. Additionally, if the length of the binary string is zero or less, the function handles this by maintaining a zeroed prefix balance list and reflecting that in its results.**
