Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1; if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` includes this `count`. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains initialized to all 0's and unchanged.***
