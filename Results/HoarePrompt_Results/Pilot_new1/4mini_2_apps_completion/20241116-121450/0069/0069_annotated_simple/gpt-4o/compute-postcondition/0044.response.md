The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is taken from the `data` list, and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `results`, `T`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `x` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is assigned a value from `int(data[index])`, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])**
