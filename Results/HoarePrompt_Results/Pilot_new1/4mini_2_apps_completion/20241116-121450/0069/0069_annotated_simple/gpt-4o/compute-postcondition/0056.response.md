Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance up to the `i-th` character in `s`, where '0' contributes +1 and '1' contributes -1. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. `balance` is the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.**
