Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s` up to the `i-th` index. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. Additionally, `T` is at least 1, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, and `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`.**
