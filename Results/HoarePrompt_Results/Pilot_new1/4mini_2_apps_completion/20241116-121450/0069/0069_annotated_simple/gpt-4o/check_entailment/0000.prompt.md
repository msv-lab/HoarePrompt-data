You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of 0-s and 1-s. You build an infinite string $t$ as a concatenation of an infinite number of strings $s$, or $t = ssss \dots$ For example, if $s =$ 10010, then $t =$ 100101001010010...

Calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$. The balance of some string $q$ is equal to $cnt_{0, q} - cnt_{1, q}$, where $cnt_{0, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 0 in $q$, and $cnt_{1, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 1 in $q$. The number of such prefixes can be infinite; if it is so, you must say that.

A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string "abcd" has 5 prefixes: empty string, "a", "ab", "abc" and "abcd".


-----Input-----

The first line contains the single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Next $2T$ lines contain descriptions of test cases — two lines per test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$) — the length of string $s$ and the desired balance, respectively.

The second line contains the binary string $s$ ($|s| = n$, $s_i \in \{\text{0}, \text{1}\}$).

It's guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ doesn't exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

Print $T$ integers — one per test case. For each test case print the number of prefixes or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such prefixes.


-----Example-----
Input
4
6 10
010010
5 3
10101
1 0
0
2 0
01

Output
3
0
1
-1



-----Note-----

In the first test case, there are 3 good prefixes of $t$: with length $28$, $30$ and $32$.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        
        s = data[index + 2]
        
        index += 3
        
        balance = s.count('0') - s.count('1')
        
        prefix_balances = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1
                )
        
        if balance == 0:
            if x in prefix_balances:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(0)
        else:
            count = 0
            for b in prefix_balances:
                if (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0:
                    count += 1
            results.append(count)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain -1; if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` will contain the count of elements `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and `results` will reflect the conditions based on `balance` and `x` without any valid computations. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `T` is greater than 0, the loop will execute, printing each element in `results`. If `results` contains at least `k` elements, where `k` is the number of times the loop executes, then `prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 1, `balance` is either 0 or non-zero, and `x` is in `prefix_balances` or valid conditions for counting in `results` are met. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list, with `prefix_balances` being a list of zeros if `n` is 0 or lower.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
