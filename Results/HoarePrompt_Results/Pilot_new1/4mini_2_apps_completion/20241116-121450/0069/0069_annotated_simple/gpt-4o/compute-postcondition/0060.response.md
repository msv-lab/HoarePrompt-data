Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance up to the `i-th` character in `s`. The variable `balance` is equal to 0, indicating that the count of '0's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `s`. `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is assigned a value that is not present in `prefix_balances`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` has been increased by 3.***
