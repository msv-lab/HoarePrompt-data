Output State: **If `T` is greater than 0, the loop will execute, printing each element in `results`. If `results` contains at least `k` elements, where `k` is the number of times the loop executes, then `prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 1, `balance` is either 0 or non-zero, and `x` is in `prefix_balances` or valid conditions for counting in `results` are met. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list, with `prefix_balances` being a list of zeros if `n` is 0 or lower.**
