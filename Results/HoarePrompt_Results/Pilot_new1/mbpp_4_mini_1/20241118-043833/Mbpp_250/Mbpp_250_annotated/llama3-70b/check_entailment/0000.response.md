Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and uses the `count` method of the tuple to return the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. 

The annotations state that the program returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup` and claim that there are no edge cases or missing functionality in this implementation. The `count` method is a built-in Python function that works correctly for all data types, including numbers, strings, and even complex objects, as long as they are hashable. 

Since the `count` method handles all potential cases, including when `elem` is not found in `tup` (returning 0), or when `tup` is empty (also returning 0), the program adheres to the problem description for every potential case. 

Furthermore, the annotations align with the code's behavior, confirming that the function works as intended without any overlooked edge cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
