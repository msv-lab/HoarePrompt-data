Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to count occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The assertions provided test various scenarios:

1. Counting the occurrences of `4` in the tuple returns `0`, which is correct since `4` is not in the tuple.
2. Counting the occurrences of `10` returns `3`, which is correct as `10` appears three times in the tuple.
3. Counting the occurrences of `8` returns `4`, which is also correct since `8` appears four times.

Since the program handles the provided test cases correctly and follows the problem description, it is deemed correct.
