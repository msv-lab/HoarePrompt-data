Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple and an element as input and returns the count of occurrences of that element in the tuple using the `count` method of the tuple, which is appropriate for this task.

The logic is straightforward:
- `tup.count(element)` accurately counts how many times `element` appears in `tup`.

The code will work correctly for various scenarios, including:
1. When the tuple is empty (it will return 0).
2. When the element is not present in the tuple (it will also return 0).
3. When the element appears multiple times (it will return the correct count).
4. When the element is present multiple times but of different types (the count will be specific to the exact type and value).

Since I cannot find any potential edge cases or examples where the code fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
