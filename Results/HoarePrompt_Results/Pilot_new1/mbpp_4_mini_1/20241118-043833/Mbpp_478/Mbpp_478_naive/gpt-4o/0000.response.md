Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it only retains uppercase characters. This does not meet the requirement of removing entire lowercase substrings. For example, if the input string is "helloWorld", the expected output should be "World" (removing "hello" as a lowercase substring), but the program will incorrectly return "W" (only keeping the uppercase 'W'). 

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic to remove all lowercase substrings, leading to incorrect behavior for inputs that contain both lowercase and uppercase characters.
