Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it only retains uppercase characters. This does not align with the problem description, which implies that any lowercase substring (which could be a sequence of lowercase letters) should be removed entirely from the string, not just filtered out character by character. 

For example, consider the input string "HelloWorld". The expected output, according to the problem description, would be "HW", since all lowercase substrings ("ello", "orld") should be removed. However, the program will output "HW", which is correct in this specific case, but let's consider another case:

For the input "abcDEFgh", the expected output should be "DEFG", as it should remove the entire lowercase substrings "abc" and "gh". However, the program will output "DE", incorrectly retaining "F" and omitting "G".

Thus, the program does not handle the requirement of removing entire lowercase substrings correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain cases.
