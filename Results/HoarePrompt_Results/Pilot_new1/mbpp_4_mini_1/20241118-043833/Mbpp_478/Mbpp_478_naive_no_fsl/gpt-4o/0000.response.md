Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program only retains uppercase characters and removes all lowercase characters, which is not the same as removing lowercase substrings.

For example, consider the input string `'helloWORLD'`. The expected behavior, according to the problem description, would be to remove the lowercase substring `'hello'`, resulting in `'WORLD'`. However, the program will return `'WORLD'`, which is correct for that specific case, but it does not address the requirement of removing entire lowercase substrings.

Additionally, if we take the input string `'abcDEFghi'`, the expected output should be `'DEF'`, but the program will return `'DEF'`, which again seems correct. However, the logic is flawed in that it does not actually remove substrings but rather individual characters.

Thus, the program fails to correctly interpret and implement the requirement of removing lowercase substrings as a whole, leading to its incorrectness.
