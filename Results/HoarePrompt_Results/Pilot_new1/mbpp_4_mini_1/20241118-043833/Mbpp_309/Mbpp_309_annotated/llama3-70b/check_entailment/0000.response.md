Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. While the function correctly utilizes Python's built-in `max` function to return the maximum of two numbers, the annotations mention that the function does not handle specific edge cases, such as when both parameters are equal or when they are of different types (e.g., integers and strings).

1. **Equal Values**: The problem description does not specify what should happen when both numbers are equal. The code will return one of the equal values, which may be acceptable, but it is not explicitly stated in the problem description.

2. **Different Types**: The annotations point out that the function does not handle cases where `a` and `b` are of different types. For example, if `a` is an integer and `b` is a string, the `max` function will raise a `TypeError` in Python 3. This is a significant edge case that the program does not account for, meaning it will fail under those conditions.

Since the code does not handle these potential cases correctly as per the problem description and the annotations indicate that there are shortcomings in handling edge cases, the overall correctness is deemed **False**.
