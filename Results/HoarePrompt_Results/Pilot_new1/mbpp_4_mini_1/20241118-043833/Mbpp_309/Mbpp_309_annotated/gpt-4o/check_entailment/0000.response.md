Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of finding the maximum of two numbers as described in the problem statement. 

1. The function takes two parameters `a` and `b`.
2. It uses a conditional expression to return `a` if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise it returns `b`.
3. The annotation states that the function returns the greater value between `a` and `b`. If both values are equal, it returns either `a` or `b`, which is accurate since they are the same.

I have considered edge cases:
- If `a` is greater than `b`, the function correctly returns `a`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, the function correctly returns `b`.
- If `a` and `b` are equal, the function will return either `a` or `b`, which is also correct.

Since the function handles all potential cases as described and the annotations align with the expected behavior, I conclude that the code is correct.
