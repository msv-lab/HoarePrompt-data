The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` can be any comparable values, such as integers, floats, or strings. The function compares these two values and returns the greater value between `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two comparable values `a` and `b`, and return the greater of the two. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater value between `a` and `b`.**
