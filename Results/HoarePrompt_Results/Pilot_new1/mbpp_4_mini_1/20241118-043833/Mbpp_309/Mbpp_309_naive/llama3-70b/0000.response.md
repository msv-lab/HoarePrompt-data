Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(a, b)` uses Python's built-in `max` function, which accurately returns the maximum of the two input numbers `a` and `b`. 

The program handles all potential cases, including:
1. Both numbers being equal.
2. One number being greater than the other.
3. Handling of negative numbers and zeros.

Since the `max` function is designed to handle all numerical comparisons correctly, there are no edge cases where the program would fail to find the maximum of two numbers. Thus, the program works as expected for all input scenarios.
