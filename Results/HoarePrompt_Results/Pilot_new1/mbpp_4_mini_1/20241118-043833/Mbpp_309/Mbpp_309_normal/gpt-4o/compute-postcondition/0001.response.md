The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are comparable values, which can be integers, floats, or strings. After executing the function body, it returns the greater of the two values, `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two comparable values, `a` and `b`, and return the greater of the two. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater of the two values.**
