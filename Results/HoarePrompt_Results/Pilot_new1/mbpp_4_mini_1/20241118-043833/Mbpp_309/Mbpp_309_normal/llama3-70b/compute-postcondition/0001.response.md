The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` can be any comparable values, such as integers, floats, or strings. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two comparable values, `a` and `b`, and return the maximum value between them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`.**
