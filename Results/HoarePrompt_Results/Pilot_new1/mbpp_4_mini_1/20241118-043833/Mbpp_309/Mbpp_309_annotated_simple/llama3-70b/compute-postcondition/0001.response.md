The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` can be any comparable types, such as integers or floats. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two comparable parameters `a` and `b`, and return the maximum value between them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, and returns the maximum value between a and b.**
