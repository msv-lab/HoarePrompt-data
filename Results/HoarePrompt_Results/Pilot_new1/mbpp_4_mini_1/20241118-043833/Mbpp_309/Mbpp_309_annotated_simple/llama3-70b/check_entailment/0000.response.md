Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the maximum of two numbers. The function `func_1(a, b)` uses Python's built-in `max` function, which accurately returns the larger of the two inputs, `a` and `b`. 

This implementation will work for all potential cases, including:
- Positive numbers (e.g., `func_1(3, 5)` returns `5`)
- Negative numbers (e.g., `func_1(-1, -5)` returns `-1`)
- A mix of positive and negative numbers (e.g., `func_1(-2, 3)` returns `3`)
- Equal numbers (e.g., `func_1(4, 4)` returns `4`)

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and follows the problem description without any missing logic or edge cases, the correctness of the code is confirmed to be true.
