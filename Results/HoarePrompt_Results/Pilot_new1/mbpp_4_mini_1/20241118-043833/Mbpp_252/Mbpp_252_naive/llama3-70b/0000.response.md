Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates by returning the magnitude (absolute value) of the complex number and its phase angle. The use of `abs(c)` computes the magnitude, and `cmath.phase(c)` computes the phase angle, both of which are standard methods for handling complex numbers in Python. Since the implementation adheres to the problem description and handles all complex number inputs correctly, I cannot identify any potential cases where it would fail.
