Functionality: ** The function accepts a complex number `c` and returns a tuple containing the absolute value of `c` and its phase angle. It does not handle any exceptions or errors, but since `cmath.phase(c)` and `abs(c)` are designed to work with complex numbers, it should function correctly for any valid complex input. **
