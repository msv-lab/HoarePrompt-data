To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the annotated code.

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a Python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

**Annotated Program:**
```python
def func_1(c):
    return abs(c), cmath.phase(c)
    # The program returns the absolute value and the phase of the complex number c
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function Definition:** The function `func_1` takes a single argument `c`, which is expected to be a complex number.
2. **Return Values:**
   - `abs(c)`: This computes the magnitude (or absolute value) of the complex number `c`.
   - `cmath.phase(c)`: This computes the phase (or angle) of the complex number `c`.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:
- The function is supposed to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates, which typically consist of the magnitude and the angle.
- The code correctly computes the magnitude and phase of the complex number using the appropriate functions.

### Edge Cases:
- The code should work for any complex number, including:
  - Positive and negative real numbers (e.g., `1 + 0j`, `-1 + 0j`)
  - Pure imaginary numbers (e.g., `0 + 1j`, `0 - 1j`)
  - Zero (e.g., `0 + 0j`)
  - Complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts (e.g., `1 + 1j`, `-1 - 1j`)

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For `0 + 0j`, `abs(0 + 0j)` should return `0`, and `cmath.phase(0 + 0j)` should return `0.0` (by convention).
- For `1 + 0j`, `abs(1 + 0j)` should return `1`, and `cmath.phase(1 + 0j)` should return `0.0`.
- For `0 + 1j`, `abs(0 + 1j)` should return `1`, and `cmath.phase(0 + 1j)` should return `π/2` (or approximately `1.5708`).
- For `-1 - 1j`, `abs(-1 - 1j)` should return approximately `1.4142`, and `cmath.phase(-1 - 1j)` should return `-3π/4` (or approximately `-2.3562`).

### Conclusion:
The function correctly computes the polar coordinates for all potential cases of complex numbers. There are no edge cases where the function fails to meet the requirements as stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
