The provided program `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists, where each sublist is expected to contain exactly two elements, and return a list of two lists: one containing the first elements of each sublist and the other containing the second elements.

Upon reviewing the code:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    first_elements = [sublist[0] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    second_elements = [sublist[1] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
```

The program correctly extracts the first and second elements from each sublist. However, it does not handle cases where a sublist does not contain exactly two elements. If a sublist has fewer than two elements, an `IndexError` will occur when attempting to access `sublist[1]`. 

The output hints clarify this issue by stating that if any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, an `IndexError` may occur, which is not handled in the code. Therefore, the function's behavior is not guaranteed for inputs that do not meet the requirement of each sublist having exactly two elements.

Additionally, the output hints provide examples that confirm the expected behavior of the function when inputs are valid, but they also highlight the potential for failure when inputs are not valid.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly when sublists do not contain exactly two elements.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails in cases like `func_1([[1]])` or `func_1([[1, 2], [3]])`, which would raise an `IndexError` due to the lack of a second element in the sublist(s).
