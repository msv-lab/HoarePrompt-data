The code creates a new list called `second_elements` that contains the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The variable `first_elements` remains unchanged, and the state of `list_of_lists` is used to populate `second_elements`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new list derived from `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list of the first elements from each sublist; `second_elements` is a list of the second elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
