The code creates a new list, `first_elements`, which contains the first element of each sublist from `list_of_lists`. The initial state indicates that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, each containing exactly two elements. Therefore, `first_elements` will be a list that holds the first elements of each of those sublists. The state of `list_of_lists` is not affected. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list of the first elements from each sublist.**
