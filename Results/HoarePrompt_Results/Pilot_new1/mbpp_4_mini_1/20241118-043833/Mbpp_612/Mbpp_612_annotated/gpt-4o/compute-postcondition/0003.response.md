The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two separate lists: `first_elements` and `second_elements`, which are derived from the first and second elements of each sublist, respectively. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return a list that contains two lists: one with the first elements and another with the second elements from each sublist.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists with exactly two elements each, and returns a list containing two lists: one with the first elements and another with the second elements from each sublist.**
