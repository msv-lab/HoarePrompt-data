Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists, where each sublist is expected to contain exactly two elements. It returns a list containing two lists: the first list contains the first elements from each sublist, and the second list contains the second elements. However, if any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, an `IndexError` will occur, as the code does not handle such cases. **
