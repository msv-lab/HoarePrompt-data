To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It should return a list of two lists:
1. The first list should contain the first elements of each sublist.
2. The second list should contain the second elements of each sublist.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    first_elements = [sublist[0] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    second_elements = [sublist[1] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
    #The program returns a list containing 'first_elements' and 'second_elements'
```

### Code Analysis:
1. **List Comprehension**: The code uses list comprehensions to extract the first and second elements from each sublist.
2. **Return Value**: The function returns a list containing two lists: one for the first elements and one for the second elements.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Empty Input**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return `[[], []]`, which is valid and aligns with the description.
2. **Sublists with Incorrect Length**: If any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, the code will raise an `IndexError`. For example, if `list_of_lists` is `[[1], [2, 3]]`, trying to access `sublist[1]` in the first sublist will cause an error. This situation is not handled in the code.
3. **Non-List Elements**: If the input contains elements that are not lists (e.g., `[[1, 2], 3]`), the code will also raise an error when trying to iterate over the non-list element.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where sublists do not contain exactly two elements or when the input contains non-list elements. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
