To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1`.

The problem description states that the function should take a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and return a list of two lists: the first containing the first elements of each sublist, and the second containing the second elements.

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list((element[0] for element in list_of_lists)), list((element[1] for element in list_of_lists))]
```

1. **Input Handling**: The function expects `list_of_lists` to be a list of lists, where each inner list has exactly two elements. If the input does not meet this requirement (e.g., an empty list, lists with fewer or more than two elements), the function will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `element[0]` or `element[1]`.

2. **Output Structure**: The output is structured correctly as a list of two lists. The first list correctly gathers the first elements of each sublist, and the second list gathers the second elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty (`[]`), the function will return `[[], []]`, which is correct as there are no elements to extract.
   - If the input contains sublists with fewer than two elements (e.g., `[[1], [2]]`), it will raise an `IndexError`.
   - If the input contains sublists with more than two elements (e.g., `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`), it will still only take the first two elements, which is not what the problem description specifies.

Given these points, we can conclude that the program does not handle cases where the inner lists do not have exactly two elements properly, which is a requirement based on the problem description.

Thus, we can find a case where the program does not work as expected:

- Input: `[[1], [2]]` would raise an `IndexError`.
- Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]` would not produce the expected output according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
