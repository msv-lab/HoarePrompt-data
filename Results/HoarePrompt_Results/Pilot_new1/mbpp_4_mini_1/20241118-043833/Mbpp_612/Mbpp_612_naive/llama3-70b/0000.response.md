Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly processes a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It constructs two separate lists: one containing the first elements of each sublist and the other containing the second elements. 

1. If the input is an empty list, the function will return `[[], []]`, which is the correct result.
2. If the input is a list of sublists, such as `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, the function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which is also correct.
3. The function assumes that each sublist has exactly two elements, and it handles this correctly by iterating through `list_of_lists` and accessing the first and second elements directly.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases I can think of, it is correct.
