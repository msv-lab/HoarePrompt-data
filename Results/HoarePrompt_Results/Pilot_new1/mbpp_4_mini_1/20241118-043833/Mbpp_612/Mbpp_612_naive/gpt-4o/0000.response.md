Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle cases where the sublists do not contain exactly two elements. For example, if the input is `func_1([[1], [2], [3]])`, it will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element of the first sublist, which does not exist. This shows that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
