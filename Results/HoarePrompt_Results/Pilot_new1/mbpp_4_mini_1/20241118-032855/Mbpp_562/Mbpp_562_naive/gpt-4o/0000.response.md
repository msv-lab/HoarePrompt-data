Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the length of the longest sublist in a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist, checks its length, and updates the maximum length found. The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, it is deemed correct.
