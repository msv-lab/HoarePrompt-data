The value of `max_length` is assigned the length of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, its length will determine the new value of `max_length`. The previous value of `max_length` could be either the length of the second sublist or 0, but it will now be updated to the length of `sublist`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in the list, `max_length` is now the length of `sublist`**
