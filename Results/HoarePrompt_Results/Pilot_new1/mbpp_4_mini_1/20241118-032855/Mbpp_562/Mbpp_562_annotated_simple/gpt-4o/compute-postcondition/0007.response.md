Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list, and `max_length` is either the length of `sublist` or remains 0. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. If the length of `sublist` is less than or equal to `max_length`, then `max_length` remains unchanged.***
