According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, and `sublist` is the first sublist in the list. For the loop to be executed one more time, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 sublists, and `sublist` should be the second sublist in the list.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list, `max_length` is either the length of `sublist` or remains 0**
