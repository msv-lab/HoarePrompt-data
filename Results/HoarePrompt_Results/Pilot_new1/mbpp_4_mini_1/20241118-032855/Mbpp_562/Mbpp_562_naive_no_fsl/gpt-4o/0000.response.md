Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the length of the longest sublist within a list of lists. It initializes a variable `max_length` to zero and iterates through each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`. During each iteration, it checks the length of the current sublist and updates `max_length` if the current sublist's length is greater than the previously recorded maximum length.

The function has been tested with various assertions, and all assertions are correct:

1. For `[[1], [1, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]`, the longest sublist is `[5, 6, 7, 8]`, which has a length of 4.
2. For `[[0, 1], [2, 2], [3, 2, 1]]`, the longest sublist is `[3, 2, 1]`, which has a length of 3.
3. For `[[7], [22, 23], [13, 14, 15], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]]`, the longest sublist is `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, which has a length of 5.

Additionally, the function handles edge cases, such as:
- An empty list of lists (`func_1([])`) would return 0, correctly indicating that there are no sublists.
- It works for sublists of varying lengths and types of elements.

Since there are no identified cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, the function is correct.
