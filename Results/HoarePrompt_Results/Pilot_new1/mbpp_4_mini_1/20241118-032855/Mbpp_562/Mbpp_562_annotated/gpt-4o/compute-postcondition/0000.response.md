The variable `max_length` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any other variables, including `list_of_lists`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `max_length`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist can contain any type of elements; `max_length` is 0**
