Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 2 sublists. If the length of `sublist` (the second sublist) is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. If the length of `sublist` is less than or equal to `max_length`, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
