Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist` if that length is greater than the previous value of `max_length`. If the length of `sublist` is less than or equal to `max_length`, then `max_length` remains unchanged at 0.***
