The variable `max_length` is assigned the value of the length of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, its length is determined by the number of elements it contains. The exact value of `max_length` will depend on the specific contents of the third sublist, which is not provided. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in the list, and `max_length` is the length of `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in the list, and `max_length` is the length of `sublist`**
