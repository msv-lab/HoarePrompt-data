The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists. After executing the function body, it returns the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, which is non-negative and could be 0 if `list_of_lists` is empty. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return the length of the longest sublist, accounting for the possibility of an empty input. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists, and returns the length of the longest sublist. If list_of_lists is empty, it returns 0.**
