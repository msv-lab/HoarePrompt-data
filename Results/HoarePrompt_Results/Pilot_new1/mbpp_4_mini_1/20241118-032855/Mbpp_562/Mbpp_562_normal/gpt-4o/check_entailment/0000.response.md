To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code carefully.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function that finds the length of the longest sublist from a list of lists. 

### Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        if len(sublist) > max_length:
            max_length = len(sublist)
    return max_length
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a list of lists and returns the length of the longest sublist. If the input list is empty, it returns 0. The function correctly handles cases where all sublists are empty or when there is a mix of empty and non-empty sublists.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Basic Functionality**: The function iterates through each sublist in the `list_of_lists` and checks if the length of the current sublist is greater than `max_length`. If it is, `max_length` is updated. Finally, it returns `max_length`.
2. **Empty Input Handling**: The function does not explicitly check for an empty input list. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop will not run, and `max_length` will remain 0, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: If the input is `[]`, the function will return 0, which is correct.
- **All Empty Sublists**: If the input is `[[], [], []]`, the function will return 0, which is also correct.
- **Mixed Sublists**: If the input is `[[], [1, 2], [], [3]]`, the function will return 2, which is correct as the longest sublist has length 2.

### Checking Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function correctly handles cases where all sublists are empty or when there is a mix of empty and non-empty sublists, which aligns with the program's logic. 

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program against the problem description and the output hints, I find that the program correctly implements the required functionality. It handles all specified cases, including empty inputs and mixed content.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
