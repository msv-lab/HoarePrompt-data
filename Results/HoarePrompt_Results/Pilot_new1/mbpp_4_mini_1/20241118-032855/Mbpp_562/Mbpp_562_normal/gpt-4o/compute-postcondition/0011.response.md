According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` has at least 4 sublists, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, and `sublist` is the third sublist in the list. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the `list_of_lists` must have at least 4 sublists, and the `sublist` should be the fourth sublist in the list. The `max_length` does not need to change unless the length of the fourth sublist exceeds the current `max_length`.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 4 sublists, `sublist` is the fourth sublist in the list, `max_length` is a non-negative integer**
