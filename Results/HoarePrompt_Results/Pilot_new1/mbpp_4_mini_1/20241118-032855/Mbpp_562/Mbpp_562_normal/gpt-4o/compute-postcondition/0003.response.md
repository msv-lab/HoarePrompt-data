The variable `max_length` is assigned the value of `len(sublist)`, which calculates the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `sublist` is defined as the first sublist and its length is greater than 0, `max_length` will hold a positive integer value. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list, `max_length` is the length of `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list, `max_length` is the length of `sublist`**
