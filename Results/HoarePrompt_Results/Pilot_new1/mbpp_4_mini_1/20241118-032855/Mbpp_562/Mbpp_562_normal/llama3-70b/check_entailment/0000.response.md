To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the function and its implications.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function to find the length of the longest sublists.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max((len(sublist) for sublist in lists))
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a list of lists and returns the length of the longest sublist within that list. If the input list is empty or contains empty sublists, it will raise a ValueError due to the use of `max()` on an empty sequence.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code iterates through each sublist in `lists` and computes the length using `len(sublist)`.
2. It then uses the `max()` function to return the maximum length found.
3. If `lists` is empty, the `max()` function will raise a ValueError, which aligns with the output hints.

### Edge Cases:
- If the input `lists` is empty (`lists = []`), the code will raise a ValueError.
- If the input `lists` contains only empty sublists (e.g., `lists = [[], []]`), the code will also raise a ValueError because it attempts to find the maximum length of an empty sequence.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints correctly state that the function will raise a ValueError if the input list is empty or if it contains only empty sublists. This matches the behavior of the code.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty or contains only empty sublists, which is a requirement based on the problem description. Therefore, it fails to meet the correctness criteria for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does not handle the case of an empty input list or a list of empty sublists properly, as it raises a ValueError in such scenarios instead of returning a meaningful result.
