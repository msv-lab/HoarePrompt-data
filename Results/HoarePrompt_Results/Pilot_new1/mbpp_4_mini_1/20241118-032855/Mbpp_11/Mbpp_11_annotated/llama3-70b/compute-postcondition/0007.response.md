The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `c`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`. If both the first occurrence and last occurrence of `c` in `s` are found (i.e., neither is -1), the function returns the substring of `s` that excludes the first occurrence of `c` and the last occurrence of `c`. If either the first occurrence or the last occurrence of `c` is not found (i.e., one of them is -1), the function returns the original string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, and return a modified version of `s` based on the presence of `c` within it. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, returns the substring of `s` excluding the first and last occurrences of `c` if both are found; otherwise, it returns the original string `s`.**
