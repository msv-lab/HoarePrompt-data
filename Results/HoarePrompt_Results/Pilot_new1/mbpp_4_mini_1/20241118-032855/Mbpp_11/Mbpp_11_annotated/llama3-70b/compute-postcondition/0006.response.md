Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1, the function returns the substring of `s` that excludes the first occurrence of `c` and the last occurrence of `c`. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, indicating that `c` is not present in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`.***
