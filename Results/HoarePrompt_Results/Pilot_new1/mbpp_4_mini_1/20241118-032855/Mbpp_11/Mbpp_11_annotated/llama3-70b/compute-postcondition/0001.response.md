The value of `last_occ` is assigned the result of `s.rfind(c)`, which returns the highest index of the substring `c` in the string `s` or `-1` if `c` is not found. The previous values of `s` and `c` are not affected, and `first_occ` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `s`, `c`, and the newly calculated `last_occ`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or `-1`, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or `-1**.
