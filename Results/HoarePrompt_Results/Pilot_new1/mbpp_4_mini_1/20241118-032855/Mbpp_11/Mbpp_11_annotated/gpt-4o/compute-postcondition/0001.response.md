The code assigns `last_index` the value of `s.rfind(ch)`, which searches for the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. The value of `last_index` will depend on whether `ch` is found in `s`. If `ch` is found, `last_index` will be the index of its last occurrence; if not, it will be -1. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found**
