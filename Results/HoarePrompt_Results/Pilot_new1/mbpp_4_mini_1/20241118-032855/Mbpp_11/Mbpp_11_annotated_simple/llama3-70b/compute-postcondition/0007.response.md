The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `c`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `c` is a single character. The function identifies the index of the first occurrence (`first_occ`) and the last occurrence (`last_occ`) of the character `c` in the string `s`. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are found (i.e., both are not -1), the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1 (indicating that `c` is not present in `s` or appears only once), the function returns the string `s` unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `c`, and modify the string by removing the first and last occurrences of `c` if both are present, or return the original string if not.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `c`, returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if both are present; otherwise, it returns the string `s` unchanged.**
