Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `c`. It returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if both are present; otherwise, it returns the string `s` unchanged. If `c` is not found in `s`, or if `c` appears only once, the function does not modify the string. **
