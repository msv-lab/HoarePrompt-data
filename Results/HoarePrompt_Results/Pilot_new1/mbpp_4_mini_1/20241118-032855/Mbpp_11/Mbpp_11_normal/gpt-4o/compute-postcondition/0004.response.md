Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found. If `first_index` is -1, `last_index` is -1, or both indices are equal, the function returns the original string `s`.***
