The variable `first_index` is assigned the value of `s.find(ch)`, which returns the lowest index of the substring `ch` in the string `s`. The previous values of `s` and `ch` are not specified, but `first_index` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or `-1` if `ch` is not found. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `s`, `ch`, and `first_index`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found**
