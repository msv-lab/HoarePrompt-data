To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem description:
The task is to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(s, c):
    first_occ = s.find(c)
    last_occ = s.rfind(c)
    if first_occ != -1 and last_occ != -1:
        return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Initial assessment:
1. The function uses `find` to locate the first occurrence of `c` and `rfind` to locate the last occurrence of `c`.
2. If both occurrences are found (i.e., `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1), it constructs a new string by:
   - Taking the substring before the first occurrence.
   - Taking the substring between the first and last occurrences (excluding the first occurrence).
   - Taking the substring after the last occurrence.
3. If `c` is not found, it returns the original string.

### Potential edge cases:
1. If `c` occurs only once in the string, the program should remove that occurrence and return the substring before it followed by the substring after it. This is handled correctly in the code since `last_occ` will be equal to `first_occ`, and the resulting string will exclude that character.
2. If `c` occurs multiple times, the first and last occurrences should be removed correctly.
3. If `c` is not present in the string, the function correctly returns the original string.

### Output hints:
The output hints state:
- The function returns a new string formed by removing the first occurrence of `c` and including the substring between the first and last occurrences of `c`, followed by the substring after the last occurrence of `c`, if both occurrences are found.
- If `c` is not found in `s`, the function returns the original string unchanged.
- If `c` occurs only once, the function will return the substring before that occurrence followed by the substring after it, effectively removing the character and everything after it.

### Verification of output hints:
The output hints align with the code functionality:
- The hints correctly describe the behavior of the code for both cases where `c` occurs multiple times and where it occurs only once.
- The hints also accurately describe the case where `c` is not found.

### Conclusion:
Since the code handles all cases as described in the problem description and aligns with the output hints without any contradictions or missing logic, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
