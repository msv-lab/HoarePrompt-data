Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `c`. It returns a new string formed by removing the first occurrence of `c` and including the substring between the first and last occurrences of `c`, followed by the substring after the last occurrence of `c`, if both occurrences are found. If `c` is not found in `s`, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged. If `c` occurs only once, the function will return the substring before that occurrence followed by the substring after it, effectively removing the character and everything after it. **
