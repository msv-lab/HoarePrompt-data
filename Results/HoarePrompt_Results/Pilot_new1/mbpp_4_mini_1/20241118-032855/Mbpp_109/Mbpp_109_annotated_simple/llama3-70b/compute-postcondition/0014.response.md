The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `n`. The parameter `s` is a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1', while `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is not 0, the function returns the sum of the odd counts of '1's in substrings of length equal to the length of `s` from `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, returning 0 if `n` is 0, or the sum of the odd counts of '1's in the specified substrings if `n` is not 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, returning 0 if `n` is 0, or the sum of the odd counts of '1's in substrings of length len(s) from `s` if `n` is not 0.**
