The last character of `binary_str` is moved to the front, and the rest of the string is shifted to the right. The values of `num_rotations`, `count`, and `_` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `binary_str` after the rotation, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is updated to 1 if `integer_value` is odd; otherwise, `count` remains 0, `_` is 1**
