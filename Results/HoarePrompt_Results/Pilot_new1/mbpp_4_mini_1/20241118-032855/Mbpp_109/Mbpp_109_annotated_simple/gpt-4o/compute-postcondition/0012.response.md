According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, indicating that there are still rotations left. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_rotations` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, it needs to be adjusted to `num_rotations` is greater than 1. The other states do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly affected by the loop's execution.

State: **`binary_str` is a rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2, `count` remains unchanged**
