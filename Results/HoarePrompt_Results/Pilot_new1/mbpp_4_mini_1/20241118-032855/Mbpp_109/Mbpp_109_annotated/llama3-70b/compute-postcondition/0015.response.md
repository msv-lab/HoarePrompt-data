Functionality: ** The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It repeats the string `s` enough times to ensure its length is at least `n`, then counts the number of '1's in each substring of length equal to `s` for indices from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. The final result is the sum of the counts of '1's found in these substrings. **
