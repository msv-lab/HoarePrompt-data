According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` should be updated to 2, and `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`s` is the binary string repeated enough times to ensure its length is at least `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `count` is either 0 or 1 depending on the count of '1's in `s`, `i` is 2, `temp` is the substring of `s` from index 1 to `len(s) + 1**
