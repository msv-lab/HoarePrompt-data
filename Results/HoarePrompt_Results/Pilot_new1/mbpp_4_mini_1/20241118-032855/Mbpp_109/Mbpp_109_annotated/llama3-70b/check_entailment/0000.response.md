To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.

### Annotations of the Program:
The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It repeats the string `s` enough times to ensure its length is at least `n`, then counts the number of '1's in each substring of length equal to `s` for indices from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. The final result is the sum of the counts of '1's found in these substrings.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **String Repetition**: The code repeats the binary string `s` to ensure that it is long enough for the rotations. This is done using `s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)`.
2. **Counting '1's**: The code counts the occurrences of '1's in each substring of length `len(s)` from index `i` to `i + len(s)`, iterating `n` times.
3. **Odd Count**: The code checks if the count of '1's is odd using `temp.count('1') % 2` and adds this to the `count` variable.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Rotation Logic**: The problem description mentions "rotating a binary string," but the code does not implement any actual rotation. Instead, it simply counts '1's in substrings of the repeated string, which does not fulfill the requirement of counting odd values from rotations.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not specifically handle cases where the string might be empty or where `n` is less than the length of `s`. While the current implementation does handle `n = 0` correctly, it fails to account for cases where the binary string's length is less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, particularly regarding the rotation aspect. The annotations do not address this critical part, leading to a misalignment between what the problem asks and what the code does. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the rotation of the binary string, which is central to the problem description. For instance, if `s = "110"` and `n = 3`, the correct rotations would be "110", "101", and "011", but the program does not account for these rotations and simply counts '1's in substrings, leading to incorrect results.
