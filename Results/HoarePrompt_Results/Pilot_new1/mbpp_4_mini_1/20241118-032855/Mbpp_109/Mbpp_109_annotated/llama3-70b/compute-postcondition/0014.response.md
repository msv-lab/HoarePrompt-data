The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `n`. The parameter `s` is a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The parameter `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the counts of '1's in the substrings of `s` from index `i` to `i + len(s)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the sum of counts of '1's in specified substrings of `s`, or 0 if `n` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the sum of counts of '1's in the substrings of `s` for indices from 0 to `n-1`, or 0 if `n` is 0.**
