The last character of `binary_str` is moved to the front, and the rest of the string is shifted to the right. Since `num_rotations` is greater than 1, this operation indicates that the string will be rotated at least once. The variable `count` remains unchanged at 0. The specific new value of `binary_str` will depend on its original content, but it will now be modified to reflect the rotation. Therefore, the output state is: `binary_str` is a rotated string (now modified), `num_rotations` is greater than 1, and `count` is 0.

Output State: **`binary_str` is a rotated string (now modified), `num_rotations` is greater than 1, and `count` is 0**
