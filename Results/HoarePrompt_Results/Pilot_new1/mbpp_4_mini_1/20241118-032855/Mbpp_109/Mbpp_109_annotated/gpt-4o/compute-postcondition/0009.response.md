The variable `integer_value` is assigned the value of `int(binary_str, 2)`, which converts the binary string `binary_str` to its integer representation. The previous values of `binary_str` and `count` are not affected by this operation, and `num_rotations` remains greater than 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables and the new value of `integer_value`.

Output State: **`binary_str` is a rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `count` is 0, and `integer_value` is the integer representation of `binary_str`**
