To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations closely.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the number of odd integers obtained from a binary string after rotating it a specified number of times.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `binary_str`, which is a binary string, and `num_rotations`, which is a non-negative integer.
2. The function initializes a `count` variable to zero.
3. It then enters a loop that runs `num_rotations` times. Inside the loop:
   - It rotates the binary string by moving the last character to the front.
   - It converts the rotated binary string to an integer.
   - It checks if this integer is odd (i.e., `integer_value % 2 == 1`). If it is odd, it increments the `count`.
4. After the loop, the function returns the `count`, which represents the number of odd integers obtained from the binary string after each rotation.

### Annotations:
- The annotations explain that if `num_rotations` is greater than 0, the final `binary_str` will be the last rotated string, and if `num_rotations` is 0, `count` remains 0 and `binary_str` remains unchanged.
- The program's output is the number of odd integers obtained from the binary string after the specified number of rotations.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
1. **Rotation Count of Zero**: If `num_rotations` is 0, the function correctly returns 0, as no rotations are performed and thus no odd integers can be counted.
2. **Single Character Binary Strings**: If `binary_str` is a single character (e.g., "0" or "1"), the function will only check that single value regardless of the number of rotations, which is correct.
3. **Binary Strings of Length Greater Than One**: The function rotates the string and counts odd integers correctly for multiple rotations.
4. **Handling of All Binary Combinations**: The function should be able to handle all binary strings, including those consisting entirely of '0's or '1's.

### Potential Issue:
One important edge case to consider is when the binary string consists of all zeros (e.g., "0000"). In this case, regardless of the number of rotations, the integer value will always be 0, which is even. Therefore, the count will remain 0, which is correct. However, if the binary string is something like "1111", it will yield odd integers after rotations.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and the annotations, I find that the program behaves as expected according to the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly counts the number of odd integers after the specified rotations and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True** 

The code is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to count odd integers after rotating the binary string the specified number of times, and it correctly handles cases where no rotations are needed or where the binary string consists of zeros.
