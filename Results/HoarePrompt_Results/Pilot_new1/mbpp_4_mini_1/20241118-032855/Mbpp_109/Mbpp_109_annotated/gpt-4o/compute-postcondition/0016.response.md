Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is a rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 2, `count` is 1 initially, and if `integer_value` is odd, `count` is incremented to 2. If `integer_value` is even, `count` remains 1. Thus, after execution, `count` is either 1 or 2 depending on the parity of `integer_value`.***
