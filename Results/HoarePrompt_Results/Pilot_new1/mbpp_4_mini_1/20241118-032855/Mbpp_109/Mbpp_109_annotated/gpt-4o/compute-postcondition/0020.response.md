The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. The parameter `binary_str` is a string consisting solely of '0's and '1's, while `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it returns the number of odd integers obtained from the binary string after performing the specified rotations, which is referred to as 'count'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, and return the count of odd integers derived from the binary string after the specified rotations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string binary_str and a non-negative integer num_rotations, and returns the count of odd integers obtained from the binary string after rotations.**
