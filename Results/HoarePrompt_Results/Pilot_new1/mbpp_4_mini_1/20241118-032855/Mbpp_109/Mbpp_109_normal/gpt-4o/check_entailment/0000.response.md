To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, we first analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
The function should find the number of odd values when rotating a binary string a given number of times.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(binary_str, num_rotations):
    count = 0
    for _ in range(num_rotations):
        binary_str = binary_str[-1] + binary_str[:-1]
        integer_value = int(binary_str, 2)
        if integer_value % 2 == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times to the right.
2. After each rotation, it converts the binary string to its decimal equivalent and checks if that value is odd.
3. It counts how many times the decimal value is odd and returns that count.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `num_rotations` is 0, the function should return 0, as the binary string remains unchanged and is not evaluated. However, the code does not explicitly handle this case.
2. The function does not consider the case where the binary string is empty. An empty string should probably return 0 since there are no values to evaluate.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`.
- It rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times to the right and counts how many times the decimal equivalent is odd.
- If `num_rotations` is 0, the function returns 0.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints agree with the code regarding the rotation and counting of odd values. However, they mention that if `num_rotations` is 0, the function should return 0. The code does not implement this behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically for the case when `num_rotations` is 0 and when the binary string is empty. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The code fails to handle the case where `num_rotations` is 0, which should return 0. Additionally, it does not account for an empty binary string, which should also return 0, making the function incorrect for those scenarios.
