Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through the input array using `enumerate`, checking if the specified element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found after checking all elements, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. 

The assertions provided in the code sample confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases, and there are no potential edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
