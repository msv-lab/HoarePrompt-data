Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element as input and iterates through the array using `enumerate` to check if the element exists in the array. If it finds the element, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found after checking all elements, it returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`. 

This behavior satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, including:
1. When the element is present in the array.
2. When the element is not present in the array.
3. When the array is empty.
4. When the element is the first or last element in the array.

Thus, the program is correct and handles all specified cases appropriately.
