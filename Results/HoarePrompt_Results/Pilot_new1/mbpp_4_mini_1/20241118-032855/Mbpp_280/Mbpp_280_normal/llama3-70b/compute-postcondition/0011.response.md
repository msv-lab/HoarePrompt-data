Output State: **If `arr` contains at least one element and `elem` is equal to an element in `arr`, the loop will return True and the index of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no value is returned. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the loop will execute for all elements without returning a value, leaving the state unchanged.**
