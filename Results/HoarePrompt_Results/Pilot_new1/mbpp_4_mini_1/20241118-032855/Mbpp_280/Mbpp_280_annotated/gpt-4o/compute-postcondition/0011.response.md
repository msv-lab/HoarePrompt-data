Output State: **If `arr` is a list with at least one element, the loop will check each element against `element`. If any `value` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and the corresponding `index`. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no return occurs; thus, the output remains undefined. If `element` is not found in `arr`, the loop completes without returning any value, and the state remains unchanged.**
