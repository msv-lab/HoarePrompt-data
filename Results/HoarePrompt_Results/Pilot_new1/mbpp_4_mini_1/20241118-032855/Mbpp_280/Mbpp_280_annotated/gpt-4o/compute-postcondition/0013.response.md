The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. The parameter `arr` is a list of elements, which can be of any type, and `element` can also be of any type. 

In Case 1, if `arr` is a list with at least one element, the function checks each element in `arr` against `element`. If any element is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` along with the corresponding index of that element in the list. If `arr` is empty, the function does not execute the loop and does not return any value, resulting in an undefined output. If `element` is not found in `arr`, the loop completes without returning any value, leaving the state unchanged.

In Case 2, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, check if the `element` exists in the list, and return `True` with the index if found, or return `False` and `-1` if not found, while handling the case of an empty list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`, returns `True` and the index of `element` if found in `arr`, or returns `False` and `-1` if not found. If `arr` is empty, the output remains undefined.**
