Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`. It checks if `element` exists in `arr` and returns `True` along with the index of `element` if found. If `element` is not found, it returns `False` and -1. If `arr` is empty, the function will execute the loop but will not find any element, ultimately returning `False` and -1. The annotations incorrectly suggest that the output remains undefined for an empty list, but the function does return a defined output in that case. **
