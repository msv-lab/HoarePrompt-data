Output State: **If `arr` is a list with at least one element, the loop will execute for each element until it finds an element equal to `elem`, returning True and the index of that element. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the loop will complete without returning any value. If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and there is no return value. In this case, the state remains unchanged.**
