To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function should:
1. Take an array and an element as inputs.
2. Return a tuple containing:
   - A boolean indicating if the element is in the array.
   - The index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(arr, elem):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == elem:
            return True, i
        
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed: If `arr` is a list with at least one element, the loop will execute for each element until it finds an element equal to `elem`, returning True and the index of that element. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the loop will complete without returning any value. If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and there is no return value. In this case, the state remains unchanged.
    return False, -1
    # The program returns False and -1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Iteration Logic**: The function uses a for loop to iterate through the array `arr`. If it finds an element equal to `elem`, it returns `True` and the index of that element. This part of the logic aligns with the problem description.

2. **Handling Element Not Found**: If the loop completes without finding `elem`, the code returns `False, -1`. This also aligns with the problem description.

3. **Handling Empty Array**: If the input array `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function directly returns `False, -1`. This is consistent with the problem description as well.

### Logical Inconsistency in Annotations:
The annotations state:
> "If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the loop will complete without returning any value."

This is a critical point. The code indeed has a return statement for when `elem` is not found, which is `return False, -1`. However, the annotation implies that if the element is not found, the function will not return anything, which is incorrect. The annotations create confusion regarding the behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases, including handling of empty arrays and elements not found in the array. The confusion arises primarily from the annotations, which inaccurately describe the behavior of the function.

Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly checks for the presence of an element in an array and returns the appropriate boolean and index as required.
