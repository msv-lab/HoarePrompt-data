According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the index of the last element in the list, and `x` will be the last element of the list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element, `i` should start at 0, and `x` should be the first element of the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list**
