Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.
2. If it finds a match between the `value` and the `element`, it returns `(True, index)`, indicating that the element is present and providing its index.
3. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`, indicating that the element is not in the array.

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Additionally, I cannot think of any edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail, such as:

- An empty array: `func_1([], 5)` should return `(False, -1)`.
- An element that is not present in the array: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)` should return `(False, -1)`.
- The element being the first or last in the array: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)` should return `(True, 0)` and `func_1([1, 2, 3], 3)` should return `(True, 2)`.

Since the function handles these scenarios correctly, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
