Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array, and the second element is the index of the element if it is found, or -1 if it is not found.

The program uses a loop to iterate through the array with `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element. If the element matches the target element (`elem`), it returns `(True, i)` where `i` is the index of the found element. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

I cannot think of any potential cases where the program would fail to meet the problem requirements. It handles cases where the element is at the beginning, middle, or end of the array, as well as cases where the element is not present at all. It also correctly handles an empty array by returning `(False, -1)`.

Thus, the program is correct for all potential cases.
