The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `elem`. The parameter `arr` is a list of elements, and `elem` can be of any type. 

In terms of functionality:

- **Case 1**: If `arr` is a non-empty list and `elem` is equal to one of its elements, the function returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `arr` is a non-empty list but `elem` is not present, the function does not return any value and leaves the state unchanged. If `arr` is an empty list, the function does not execute any loop and also leaves the state unchanged.

- **Case 2**: If the conditions in Case 1 are not met, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `elem`, returning `True` and the index of `elem` if it exists in `arr`, returning `False` and `-1` if it does not, and leaving the state unchanged if `arr` is empty. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`, returning `True` and the index of `elem` if it exists in `arr`, returning `False` and `-1` if it does not, and leaving the state unchanged if `arr` is empty.**
