According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of elements, but we need to ensure it contains at least one element for the loop to run. At the start of the loop, `index` will be 0 and `value` will be the first element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, index is 0, value is the first element in the list**
