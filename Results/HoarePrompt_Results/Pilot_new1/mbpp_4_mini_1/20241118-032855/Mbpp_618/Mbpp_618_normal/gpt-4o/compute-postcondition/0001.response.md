The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers and are of the same length. Additionally, no element in `list2` is zero. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing the results of element-wise division of `list1` by `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers of the same length and return a new list that contains the results of dividing corresponding elements from `list1` by `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, both of which are lists of numbers of the same length. It returns a list containing the results of element-wise division of list1 by list2.**
