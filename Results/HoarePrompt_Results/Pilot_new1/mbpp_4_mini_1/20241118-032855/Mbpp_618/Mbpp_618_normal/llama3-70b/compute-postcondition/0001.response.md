The code raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. This indicates that the program will terminate due to the exception being raised, and the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing state of the lists and the raised exception.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, and their lengths are not equal, and a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'**.
