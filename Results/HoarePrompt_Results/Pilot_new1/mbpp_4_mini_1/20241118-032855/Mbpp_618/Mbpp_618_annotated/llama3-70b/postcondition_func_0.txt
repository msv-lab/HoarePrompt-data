The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and raises a ValueError if they are not of equal length. If they are of equal length, it returns a new list containing the results of element-wise division of `list1` by `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, this will result in a ZeroDivisionError.
