The code raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. This indicates that the program will terminate due to this exception, and the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal. Therefore, the output state reflects that a `ValueError` has occurred.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, and the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal; a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'**.
