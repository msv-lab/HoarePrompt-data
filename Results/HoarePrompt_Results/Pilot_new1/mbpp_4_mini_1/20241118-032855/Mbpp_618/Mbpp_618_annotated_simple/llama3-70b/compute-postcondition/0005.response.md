Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and first checks if they have the same length. If not, it raises a ValueError. If they are of the same length, it returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, this will result in a ZeroDivisionError during the division operation. **
