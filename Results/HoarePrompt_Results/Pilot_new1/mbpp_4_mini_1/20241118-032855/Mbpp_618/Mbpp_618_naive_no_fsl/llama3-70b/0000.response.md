Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the second list (`list2`) contains zeros. Dividing by zero will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is not addressed in the implementation. For example, if we have `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [1, 0, 3]`, the program will attempt to divide by zero on the second element, resulting in an error. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
