Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the second list contains a zero. If `list2` has a zero at any position, the division will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`. For example:

```python
func_1([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2])
```

This would raise an error because the first element of `list2` is zero, leading to an attempt to divide by zero. Since the program does not account for this edge case, it is incorrect.
