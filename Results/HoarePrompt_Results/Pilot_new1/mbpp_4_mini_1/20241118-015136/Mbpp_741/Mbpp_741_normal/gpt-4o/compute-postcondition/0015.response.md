Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop checks each character of `s` against `first_char`. If all characters are equal to `first_char`, the loop completes without returning, and the function implicitly returns None. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False immediately. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and the state remains unchanged.**
