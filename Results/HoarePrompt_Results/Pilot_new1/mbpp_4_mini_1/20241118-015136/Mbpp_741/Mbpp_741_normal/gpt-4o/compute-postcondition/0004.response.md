According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute at least once. The loop will iterate over each character in `s`, starting with `char` being the first character of `s`. 

At the start of the loop, `first_char` is already set to the first character of `s`, which aligns with the initial state of `char`. Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are that `char` should be initialized as `first_char`, and `s` must remain a non-empty string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is `first_char`**
