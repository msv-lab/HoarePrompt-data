The provided code defines a function `func_1` that checks whether all characters in a given non-empty string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of that set is equal to 1. 

### Initial Assessment:
The problem description states that the function should check whether all characters in the string are the same. The code seems to fulfill this requirement for non-empty strings, as a set will contain only unique elements, and if all characters are the same, the set will have a length of 1.

### Edge Cases:
However, the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty string. The code does not handle this case, and if an empty string is passed to the function, it will return `True` since the set of an empty string has a length of 0, which is not what one would expect in the context of checking for uniformity of characters.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints confirm that the function accepts a non-empty string and returns `True` if all characters are the same. They also point out that the function does not handle the case of an empty string, which could lead to unexpected behavior. This aligns with the observation that passing an empty string would yield an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case, specifically for the edge case of an empty string. Since the function does not account for this case, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle the edge case of an empty string, which can lead to an unexpected result (returning `True` when it should not).
