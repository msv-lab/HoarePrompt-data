According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the second character of `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are more characters in `s` to iterate over. Since `char` is currently the second character of `s`, the next character to be iterated over will be the third character. Therefore, `s` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `char` is now the third character of `s` and that `s` must have at least 3 characters.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character of `s`.**
