To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description, the code, and the annotations step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains any `None` values. The function should return `True` if there is at least one `None` value in the tuple, and `False` if there are no `None` values or if the tuple is empty.

### Annotated Program
```python
def func_1(tup):
    for item in tup:
        if item is None:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `tup` is a tuple with at least one element, the loop will iterate over each element, and if any `item` is None, the function will return True. If `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no return value is produced. In that case, the function does not return anything, and `tup` remains unchanged.
    return False
    #The program returns False
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. The function iterates over each item in the tuple `tup`.
2. If it finds any item that is `None`, it immediately returns `True`.
3. If the loop completes without finding a `None`, it returns `False`.

### Annotations Review
The annotations state that:
- If `tup` is a tuple with at least one element and contains a `None`, the function returns `True`.
- If `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return anything, which leads to an implicit return of `None`.

### Edge Case
The critical point in the annotations is the mention of an empty tuple. The function does not explicitly handle the case where `tup` is empty. In Python, when a function does not have a return statement, it implicitly returns `None`. Therefore, if the input tuple is empty, the function will return `None`, which does not satisfy the requirement of returning `False` for an empty tuple.

### Conclusion
The function does not correctly implement the requirement for the case when the tuple is empty. According to the problem description, it should return `False` for an empty tuple. Since the function returns `None` in this case, it does not meet the requirements.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Reasoning
The program fails to return the correct output for the edge case where the input tuple is empty. Instead of returning `False`, it returns `None`, which violates the requirements stated in the problem description. The annotations helped identify this critical edge case, confirming that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
