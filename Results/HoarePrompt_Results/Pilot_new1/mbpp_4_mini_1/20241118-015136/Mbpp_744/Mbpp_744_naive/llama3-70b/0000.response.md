Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if the given tuple contains any `None` values. It uses the `any()` function combined with a generator expression that iterates over each element in the tuple and checks if it is `None`. If at least one element is `None`, `any()` will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`. 

This implementation handles all potential cases, including:
- An empty tuple, which will correctly return `False` since there are no elements to be `None`.
- A tuple with all elements being `None`, which will return `True`.
- A tuple with mixed elements, where some are `None` and others are not, which will also return `True`.

Since the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs, it is correct.
