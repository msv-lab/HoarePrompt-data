The provided function `func_1` is designed to check if the given tuple contains any `None` values. It does this by using the `any` function along with a generator expression that checks each element in the tuple.

1. **Initial Assessment**: The function appears to be correct based on the problem description. It checks each element of the tuple and returns `True` if any element is `None`, and `False` otherwise. The use of `any` is appropriate for this task.

2. **Edge Cases**: The function should handle various cases, including:
   - An empty tuple, which should return `False` since there are no elements to check.
   - A tuple with one element, which should return `True` if that element is `None` and `False` otherwise.
   - A tuple with multiple elements, where at least one element is `None`, which should return `True`.

3. **Output Hints**: The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected:
   - It states that the function returns `True` if any element in `tup` is `None`, otherwise it returns `False`.
   - It mentions that it correctly handles tuples of any size, including empty tuples, and will return `False` for an empty tuple.

The hints align with the function's logic, and there are no discrepancies noted in the behavior described in the hints versus the implementation.

Since there are no edge cases that the function fails to handle, and the output hints support the correctness of the implementation, I conclude that the function does indeed meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly identifies the presence of `None` values in the tuple, including handling empty tuples appropriately.
