Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to check if a given tuple contains any `None` values. However, the implementation uses the `any` function with a generator expression that checks for `None` values. The issue arises with the interpretation of the problem description, which states to check for "any none value or not." 

The program returns `True` if there is at least one `None` value in the tuple, which is not the same as checking if the tuple has "no None values." Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement correctly. 

For example, if we input a tuple like `(1, 2, 3)`, the expected output should be `False` since there are no `None` values. However, if we input `(None, 2, 3)`, it correctly returns `True`. 

Thus, the requirement to check for the presence of `None` values is not adequately reflected in the function's design, as it does not return a definitive answer about the presence of `None` values in a way that aligns with the problem description. 

Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the requirement as expected.
