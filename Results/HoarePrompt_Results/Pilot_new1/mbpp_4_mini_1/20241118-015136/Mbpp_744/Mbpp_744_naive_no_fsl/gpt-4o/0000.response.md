Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks if any element in the given tuple is `None`. It iterates through each item in the tuple and returns `True` if it finds a `None` value. If it completes the iteration without finding any `None` values, it returns `False`. 

The provided assertions cover the following cases:
1. A tuple containing a `None` value (expected output: `True`).
2. A tuple without any `None` values (expected output: `False`).
3. Another tuple containing a `None` value (expected output: `True`).

Since the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases and no edge cases or potential failures were identified, the function is correct.
