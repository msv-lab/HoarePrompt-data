Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. The function `func_1` iterates through the list `lst` using a for loop that goes from the first element to the second-to-last element (i.e., `len(lst) - 1`).
2. During each iteration, it compares the current element `lst[i]` with the next element `lst[i + 1]`.
3. If it finds any instance where `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such instance, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The function handles edge cases correctly:
- An empty list or a list with a single element will not enter the loop and will return `True`, as there are no elements to compare.
- For lists with two or more elements, it checks all adjacent pairs, ensuring that the list is sorted as required.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the list is sorted for all potential cases, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
