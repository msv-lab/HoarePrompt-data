Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It uses the `all()` function along with a generator expression that iterates through the list and compares each element to the next one. 

The program handles the following cases correctly:
1. An empty list: An empty list is considered sorted.
2. A single-element list: A list with one element is also considered sorted.
3. A list that is already sorted: The program will return `True`.
4. A list that is not sorted: The program will return `False`.

The program checks all pairs of consecutive elements to ensure that each element is less than or equal to the next, which is the definition of a sorted list in non-decreasing order. 

Since I could not find any example where the program fails to meet the requirements as described, I conclude that the program is correct.
