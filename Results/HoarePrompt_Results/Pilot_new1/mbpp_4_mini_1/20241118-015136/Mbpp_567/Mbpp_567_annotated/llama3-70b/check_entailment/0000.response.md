Correctness: **False**

The provided code checks if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains a single element. According to the problem description, a list that is empty or has one element should also be considered sorted because there are no elements to compare.

The annotation states: "It does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or contains a single element, which would also be considered non-decreasing by definition." This directly indicates that the function will return `False` for these cases, which contradicts the definition of a sorted list.

For example:
- For an empty list `[]`, the expected output should be `True` (considered sorted).
- For a single-element list `[5]`, the expected output should also be `True`.

However, the current implementation would return `True` for a non-empty list that is sorted but would return `False` for an empty list or a single-element list, thus failing to meet the problem description's requirements.

Therefore, since the function does not correctly handle all potential cases as described, the correctness is **False**.
