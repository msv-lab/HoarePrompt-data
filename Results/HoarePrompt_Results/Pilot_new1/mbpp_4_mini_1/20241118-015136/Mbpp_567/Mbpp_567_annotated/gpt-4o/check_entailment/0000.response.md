Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, the function should check whether the specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the code has a critical flaw in how it handles lists with fewer than two elements.

The annotations state that if the list is empty or contains only one element, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return anything, which means it implicitly returns `None`. This behavior is incorrect because an empty list or a list with a single element should be considered sorted. Therefore, the expected output for these cases should be `True`, not `None`.

For example:
- An empty list `[]` should return `True` (since there are no elements to compare).
- A list with one element `[5]` should also return `True` (as there are no pairs of elements to compare).

Since the function does not correctly handle these cases and instead returns `None`, which is not the expected behavior, the program is incorrect. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
