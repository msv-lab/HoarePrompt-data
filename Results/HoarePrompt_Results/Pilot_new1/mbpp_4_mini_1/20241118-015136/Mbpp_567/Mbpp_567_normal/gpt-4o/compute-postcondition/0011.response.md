Output State: **If `lst` has at least 2 elements, the loop checks if each element is greater than the next one. If any element `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False. If `lst` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the function implicitly returns None. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function also implicitly returns None.**
