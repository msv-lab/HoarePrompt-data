The function accepts a list `lst` and checks if the list is in non-decreasing order. It returns `False` if any element is greater than the next one. If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, the function implicitly returns `None`. If the list is in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. Therefore, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, as it implicitly returns `None` in those scenarios.
