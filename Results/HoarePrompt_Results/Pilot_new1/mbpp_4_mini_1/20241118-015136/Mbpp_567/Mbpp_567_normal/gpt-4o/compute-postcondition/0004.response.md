According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a value such that the loop has checked the last pair of elements (the elements at index `i` and `i + 1`). Since the loop iterates through `range(len(lst) - 1)`, `i` must be adjusted to continue the loop.

If `lst` has at least 2 elements, then `len(lst)` is at least 2, which means `len(lst) - 1` is at least 1. After the last iteration, `i` must be equal to `len(lst) - 2` in order for the loop to execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to the next index, which would be `len(lst) - 2`. The list remains unchanged, as it still has at least 2 elements.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`**
