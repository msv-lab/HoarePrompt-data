The code counts the number of even integers in the list `lst` by using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. Each even integer contributes `1` to the total count. The output state will reflect the current state of `lst` and the newly calculated value of `even_count`. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst**
