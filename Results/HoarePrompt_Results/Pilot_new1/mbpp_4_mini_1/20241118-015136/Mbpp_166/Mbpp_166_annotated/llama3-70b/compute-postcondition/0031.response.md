Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
