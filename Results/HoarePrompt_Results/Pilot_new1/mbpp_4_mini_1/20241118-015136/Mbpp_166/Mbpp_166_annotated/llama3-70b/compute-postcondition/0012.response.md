According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop starts with `j` equal to `i + 2`, and it continues as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `len(nums)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is adjusted to `i + 2 + 1`, which is `i + 3`, so that the loop can execute again.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `len(nums)`, which means `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, j is `i + 3`**
