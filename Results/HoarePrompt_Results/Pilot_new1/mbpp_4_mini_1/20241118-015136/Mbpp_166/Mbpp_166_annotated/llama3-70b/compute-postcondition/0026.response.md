Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, and if the bitwise XOR of nums[i] and nums[j] is even, then `count` is increased by 1. If `len(nums)` is less than or equal to `i + 1`, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is exactly 1, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged.**
