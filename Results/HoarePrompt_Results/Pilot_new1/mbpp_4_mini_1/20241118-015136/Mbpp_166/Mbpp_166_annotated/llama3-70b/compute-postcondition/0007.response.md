The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The specific values of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are not provided, but since `count` is incremented based on the condition that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, we can assume that this condition has been met for the current iteration. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is incremented by 1**
