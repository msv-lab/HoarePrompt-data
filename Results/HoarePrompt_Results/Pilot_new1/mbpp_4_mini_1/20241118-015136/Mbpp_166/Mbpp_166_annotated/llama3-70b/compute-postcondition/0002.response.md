According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is less than `len(nums)` for the loop to execute. Given that `i` is currently 0, `i + 1` equals 1, which means the loop will execute if `len(nums)` is greater than 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 0. For the loop to be executed, `nums` must have at least 2 integers, `j` will start at 1 (the value of `i + 1`), and `i` remains 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
