According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. The loop starts with `j` being `i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 1, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `j` should be set to `i + 2`. 

Additionally, since the loop is iterating through `nums`, the length of `nums` should remain the same, and we need to ensure that `j` does not exceed `len(nums)`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` is now `i + 2` and that `j` must still be less than `len(nums)`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, count is 1, j is `i + 2`**
