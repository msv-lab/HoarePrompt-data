The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is not specified. The other variables (`j` and `len(nums)`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 2`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `j` is `i + 2`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2**
