The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it is stated to be the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd. The state of the other variables `i` and `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, `i` is the index of the second to last element in `nums`, `j` is the index of the last element in `nums`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, `i` is the index of the second to last element in `nums`, `j` is the index of the last element in `nums`, and `count` is increased by 1**
