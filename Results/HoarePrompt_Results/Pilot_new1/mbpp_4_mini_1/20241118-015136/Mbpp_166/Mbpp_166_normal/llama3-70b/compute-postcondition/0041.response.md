Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, for all valid pairs in the list `nums`. If `nums` has fewer than 2 integers, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `nums` has at least 2 integers, the loop executes for `len(nums) - 1` times for the first iteration, and the number of pairs counted increments based on the parity condition `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0`.**
