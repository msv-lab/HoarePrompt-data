According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop is designed to iterate over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `len(nums) - 1`. Since it is ensured that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `i + 2`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this increment.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, `j` is `i + 2`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2**.
