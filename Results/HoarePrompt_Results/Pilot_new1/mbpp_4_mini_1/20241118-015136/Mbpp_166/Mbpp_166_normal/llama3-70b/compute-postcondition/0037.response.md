Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, `j` is `i + 2`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2. If `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the pair consists of both even or both odd numbers. If the condition is not met, `count` remains unchanged.***
