According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` starting from `i + 1` and going up to `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently `i + 2`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `i + 3`.

Since the loop's condition is based on `j` being less than `len(nums)`, we do not need to adjust `len(nums)` because it is guaranteed that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j`.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, and `j` is `i + 3`.**
