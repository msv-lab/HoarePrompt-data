According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `j`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`, and `nums` has at least 3 integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the length of `nums`. Since `j` is `i + 2`, we need to ensure that `i + 2` is less than the length of `nums`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `j` to `i + 2` and ensure that `j` is less than the length of `nums`. Thus, we need to state that the length of `nums` is at least `i + 3`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, count is 3, j is i + 2, length of nums is at least i + 3**
