The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it is implied that it is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where the conditions are met. Therefore, the output state reflects that `count` has increased by 1, while other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1**
