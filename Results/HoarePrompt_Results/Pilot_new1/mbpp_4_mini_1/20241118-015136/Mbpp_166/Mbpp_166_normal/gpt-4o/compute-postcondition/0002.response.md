The variable `even_pairs` is assigned the value of `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `even_count` is previously known, and this calculation counts the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from the `even_count` available. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculated value of `even_pairs`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`, and `even_pairs` is calculated as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`**
