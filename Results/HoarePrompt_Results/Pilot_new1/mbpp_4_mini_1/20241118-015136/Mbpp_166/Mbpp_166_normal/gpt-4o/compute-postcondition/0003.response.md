The variable `odd_pairs` is assigned the value of `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `odd_count` is previously calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`. Therefore, the value of `odd_pairs` depends on the specific value of `odd_count`. The output state reflects the new calculation for `odd_pairs` without changing the other variables.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`, `even_pairs` is calculated as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`, and `odd_pairs` is calculated as `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2**
