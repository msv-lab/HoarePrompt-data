The variable `odd_count` is assigned the value of the length of `lst` minus `even_count`. The value of `len(lst)` gives the total number of integers in the list, and by subtracting `even_count`, we determine the count of odd integers in the list. The state of `lst` and `even_count` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, and `odd_count` is calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst, and `odd_count` is calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`**
