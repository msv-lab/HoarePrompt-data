The code calculates `odd_pairs` based on the formula `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `odd_count` is not specified in the initial state, but it is known that `odd_pairs` will be determined from it. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation of `odd_pairs` based on the current value of `odd_count`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`; `odd_pairs` is `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`**
