The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 even integers and 2 odd integers from the list. It calculates the number of even and odd integers, computes the combinations of pairs for both, and returns their total. The function does not handle cases where the list is empty, which would result in returning 0 as both even_count and odd_count would be zero, leading to no pairs being possible.
