The code calculates the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from the `even_count`. The variable `even_pairs` is assigned the value of `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. The values of `even_count` and `odd_count` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `lst`, `even_count`, and `odd_count`, along with the calculated value of `even_pairs`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`**
