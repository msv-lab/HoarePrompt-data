To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Understanding XOR:
1. The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd.
2. This means:
   - Even + Even = Even
   - Odd + Odd = Even
   - Even + Odd = Odd (not what we want)

### Annotations:
The annotations in the code indicate that the program counts pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers, which is correct based on the XOR properties outlined above.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)  # Count of even numbers
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count  # Count of odd numbers
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2  # Pairs from even numbers
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2  # Pairs from odd numbers
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs  # Total pairs
```

1. **Counting Even and Odd**: The code correctly counts the number of even and odd integers in the list.
2. **Calculating Pairs**: 
   - It calculates the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from the even count using the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from the odd count.
3. **Returning Total**: Finally, it returns the sum of both even pairs and odd pairs.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the function will return `0`, which is correct since there are no pairs.
2. **Single Element List**: If the input list has one element, the function will also return `0`, which is correct since a single element cannot form a pair.
3. **All Even or All Odd**: The function should correctly count pairs in cases where all numbers are even or all are odd.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and its logic against the problem description, it appears to correctly implement the required functionality. There are no potential cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements of counting pairs that XOR to an even number.

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly counts pairs of integers that XOR to an even number by counting pairs of even and odd integers, as required by the problem description.
