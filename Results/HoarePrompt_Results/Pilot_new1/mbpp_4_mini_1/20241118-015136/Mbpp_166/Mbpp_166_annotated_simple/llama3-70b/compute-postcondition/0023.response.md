The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `len(nums)`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the increment of `count`. Therefore, the Output State is: `len(nums)` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`len(nums)` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1**
