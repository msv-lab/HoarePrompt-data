The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `len(nums)` remains unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`len(nums)` remains unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, and `count` is increased by 1**
