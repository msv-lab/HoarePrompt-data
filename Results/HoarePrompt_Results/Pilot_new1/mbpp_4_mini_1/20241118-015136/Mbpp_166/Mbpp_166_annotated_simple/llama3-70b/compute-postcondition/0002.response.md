According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop starts at `j = i + 1`, which means `j` will start at 1 if `i` is 0. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `len(nums)` is at least 1. 

Given that `i` is currently 0, `j` will start at 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1, which means the list should contain at least 2 integers.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
