The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The values of `nums`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1**
