According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` and continues until `j` is less than `len(nums)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at a value of `i + 1`, and since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `len(nums)` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. 

This means that `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is at least `len(nums) - 2`, which ensures that `j` can still be less than `len(nums)`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is incremented by 1 if the bitwise XOR of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` is even, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`**
