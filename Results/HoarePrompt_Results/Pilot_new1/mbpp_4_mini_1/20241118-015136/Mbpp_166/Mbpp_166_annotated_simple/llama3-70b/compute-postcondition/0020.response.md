The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The condition regarding `len(nums)` and the bitwise XOR operation does not affect the output state directly, but it indicates that `count` is increased under certain conditions. Since the previous value of `count` is not specified, we can only state that it has been increased. 

Output State: **`len(nums)` remains unchanged, `count` is increased by 1**
