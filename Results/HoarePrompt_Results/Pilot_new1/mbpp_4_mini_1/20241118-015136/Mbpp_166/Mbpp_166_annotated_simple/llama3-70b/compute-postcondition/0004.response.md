The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `count` while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
