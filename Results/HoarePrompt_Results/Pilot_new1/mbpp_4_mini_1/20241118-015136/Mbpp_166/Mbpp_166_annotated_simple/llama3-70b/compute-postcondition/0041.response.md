Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (i, j) such that both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are either both even or both odd. If `len(nums) < 2`, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `len(nums) == 2`, the loop executes once and `count` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are both even or both odd. If `len(nums) > 2`, the loop executes multiple times and counts all valid pairs.**
