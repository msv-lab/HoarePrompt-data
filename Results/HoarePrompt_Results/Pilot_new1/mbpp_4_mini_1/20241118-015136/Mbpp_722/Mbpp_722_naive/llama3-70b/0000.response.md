Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly filters students based on their height and weight. It uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate through the `student_data` dictionary, checking if each student's height and weight meet or exceed the specified minimum values. 

The function will return a new dictionary containing only those students who satisfy both conditions. 

For example:
- If `student_data` is `{"Alice": (170.0, 65.0), "Bob": (160.0, 70.0)}`, `min_height` is `165.0`, and `min_weight` is `60.0`, the function will return `{"Alice": (170.0, 65.0)}` since Bob does not meet the height requirement.

All edge cases, such as students with exactly the minimum height and weight, or an empty dictionary, are handled correctly by the code. Thus, I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.
