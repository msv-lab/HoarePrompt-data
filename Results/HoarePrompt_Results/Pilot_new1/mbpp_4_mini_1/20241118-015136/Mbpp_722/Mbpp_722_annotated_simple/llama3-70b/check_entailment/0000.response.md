Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a dictionary of student data, where each key is a student's name and each value is a tuple containing the student's height and weight. The function filters this data to return only those students whose height and weight are both above the specified minimum thresholds.

The code correctly implements the following logic:
1. It iterates over each student in the `student_data` dictionary.
2. For each student, it checks if both the height and weight meet or exceed the provided minimum values.
3. If both conditions are satisfied, it includes the student in the resulting dictionary.

The annotated comment accurately describes the function's purpose and behavior. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified in the logic that would cause the function to fail for any valid input as described in the problem statement.

Since the function works as intended for all possible cases based on the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.
