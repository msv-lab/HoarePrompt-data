The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a student name, and each value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight. The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats that represent the minimum height and weight thresholds, respectively. After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only those students who meet or exceed the specified minimum height and weight thresholds, with their names as keys and their (height, weight) tuples as values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight, and returns a dictionary of students who meet or exceed the minimum height and weight thresholds.**
