To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations closely.

### Problem Description
The function is expected to:
- Take a dictionary where keys are student names and values are tuples of (student_height, student_weight).
- Take two float parameters: minimal height and minimal weight.
- Return a dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight is greater than or equal to the minimum weight.

### Annotated Program
```python
def func_1(student_dict, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in student_dict.items() 
            if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
    # The program returns a dictionary containing student names and their (height, weight) tuples for students 
    # whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.
```

### Analysis
1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the items of `student_dict`.
   - It checks if each student's height and weight meet the minimum criteria.
   - If they do, it includes that student in the resulting dictionary.

2. **Return Value**:
   - The function correctly returns a dictionary that includes only those students who meet the height and weight requirements.
   - If no students meet the criteria, it returns an empty dictionary, which is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles cases where no students meet the criteria by returning an empty dictionary.
   - It correctly handles cases where some students meet the criteria and some do not.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and adheres to the requirements. The annotations accurately describe the function's behavior and confirm that it returns the expected results for valid cases.

Since I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly filters students based on the given height and weight criteria, and the annotations support this conclusion without indicating any flaws in logic or implementation.
