The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` where each key is a student's name and the value is a tuple containing the student's height and weight. It also accepts two float values `min_height` and `min_weight` as thresholds. The function returns a new dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If no students meet these criteria, an empty dictionary is returned.
