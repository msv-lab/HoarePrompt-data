The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names and values are tuples containing two floats (student_height, student_weight). The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight thresholds, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter and return a dictionary of students based on specified height and weight criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of students with their heights and weights, and two float values representing minimum height and weight thresholds. It returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
