To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the output hints, we will analyze the code and check for any edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The program is supposed to filter students from a dictionary based on their height and weight, ensuring that both values exceed or meet specified minimums.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(student_dict, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for (name, (height, weight)) in student_dict.items() if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
```

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe that the function should return a new dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If no students meet these criteria, an empty dictionary is returned.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code iterates over each student in the dictionary and checks if their height and weight meet the minimum requirements.
2. The filtering logic seems correct as it uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary based on the specified conditions.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Empty Dictionary:** If the input dictionary is empty, the function should return an empty dictionary, which it does correctly.
- **Boundary Conditions:** If a student's height or weight exactly matches the minimum requirements, they should still be included in the output dictionary. The code handles this correctly with the `>=` operator.
- **Students with Negative or Zero Values:** The code does not explicitly handle cases where height or weight might be negative or zero. However, based on the context, we can assume that the input will be valid, as it is not specified in the problem description.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints agree with the code. They specify that the function should return a dictionary of students who meet the height and weight criteria, and they correctly describe the expected behavior when no students meet the criteria.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, the problem description, and the output hints, I find that the program correctly implements the functionality as required by the problem description under all considered cases. There are no edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function accurately filters students based on the minimum height and weight, and it handles both the presence of valid students and the case of an empty input dictionary appropriately.
