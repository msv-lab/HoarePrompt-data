Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and uses the `replace` method to substitute all spaces (' ') in the string with '%20'. 

The annotation correctly describes the behavior of the program, stating that it returns the string 's' with all spaces replaced by '%20'. 

To verify correctness, we can consider various test cases:

1. Input: "Hello World" → Output: "Hello%20World"
2. Input: "  Leading and trailing spaces  " → Output: "%20%20Leading%20and%20trailing%20spaces%20%20"
3. Input: "NoSpaces" → Output: "NoSpaces"
4. Input: "" (empty string) → Output: "" (still an empty string)

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected. It replaces spaces correctly, handles leading and trailing spaces, and returns the original string if there are no spaces.

Since the function works correctly for all potential cases and the annotation accurately describes its behavior, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
