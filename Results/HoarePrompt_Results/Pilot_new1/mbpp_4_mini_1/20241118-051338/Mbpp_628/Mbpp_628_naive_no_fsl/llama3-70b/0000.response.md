Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The use of the `str.replace()` method ensures that every occurrence of a space character is replaced as specified in the problem description. 

I considered various potential cases:
1. An empty string (`""`): The output will still be an empty string, which is correct.
2. A string without spaces (`"HelloWorld"`): The output will be `"HelloWorld"`, which is correct.
3. A string with multiple spaces (`"Hello World  "`): The output will be `"Hello%20World%20%20"`, which is correct.
4. A string that starts or ends with spaces (`" Hello World"` or `"Hello World "`): The output will be `"%20Hello%20World"` or `"Hello%20World%20"`, respectively, which is correct.

Since I cannot find any case where the program does not meet the requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
