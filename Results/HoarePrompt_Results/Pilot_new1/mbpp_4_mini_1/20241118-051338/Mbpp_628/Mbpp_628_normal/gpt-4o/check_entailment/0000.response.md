The provided program is designed to replace all spaces in a given string with '%20'. The function `func_1` uses the `replace` method of strings to accomplish this.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Basic Functionality**: The code correctly replaces spaces with '%20'. For example, the string 'My Name is Dawood' is transformed into 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood', which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Leading Spaces**: If the input string has leading spaces (e.g., ' My Name'), the output would be '%20My%20Name', which is correct according to the specification.
   - **Trailing Spaces**: Similarly, for trailing spaces (e.g., 'My Name '), the output would be 'My%20Name%20', which is also correct.
   - **Multiple Spaces**: For a string with multiple consecutive spaces (e.g., 'My  Name'), the output would be 'My%20%20Name', which is correct.
   - **Empty String**: If the input is an empty string (''), the output would also be an empty string, which is correct.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts a string and returns it with all spaces replaced by '%20', and it mentions that it does not handle any other characters or edge cases such as leading or trailing spaces, or empty strings. However, the function does handle leading and trailing spaces correctly. The hints suggest that it will return the original string if there are no spaces, which is accurate.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and considering the output hints, I find that the function behaves correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement. The function correctly replaces spaces in various scenarios, including leading, trailing, and consecutive spaces. 

Thus, the function adheres to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
