The provided program is designed to replace all spaces in a given string with "%20". The code uses the `replace` method, which is a straightforward approach to achieve the goal stated in the problem description.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return s.replace(' ', '%20')
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Basic Functionality**: The code correctly replaces single spaces with "%20". For example, if the input is "Hello World", the output will be "Hello%20World".
2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - **Leading Spaces**: If the input is " Hello", the output will be "%20Hello", which is correct.
   - **Trailing Spaces**: If the input is "Hello ", the output will be "Hello%20", which is also correct.
   - **Multiple Consecutive Spaces**: If the input is "Hello  World", the output will be "Hello%20%20World", which is correct as well.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string with all spaces replaced by '%20'. It also mentions that the function does not handle other potential edge cases such as leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces.

### Conclusion:
After thorough analysis:
- The function appears to handle leading, trailing, and multiple consecutive spaces correctly, as it uses the `replace` method, which operates on all instances of the specified substring.
- The output hints incorrectly suggest that the function does not handle these edge cases when in fact it does.

Therefore, since the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
