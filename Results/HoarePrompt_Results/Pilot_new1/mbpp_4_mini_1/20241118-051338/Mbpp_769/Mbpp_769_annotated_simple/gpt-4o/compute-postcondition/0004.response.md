The `result_list` is sorted in place based on the order of the elements in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. The sorting uses a custom key function that retrieves the index of each element `x` in the concatenated list. The previous values of the affected variables are `set1`, `list2`, `set2`, `diff_elements`, and `result_list`, but the specific contents of these variables are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `result_list` has been sorted based on the specified criteria.

Output State: **`set1` is a set created from `list1`; `list2` remains unchanged; `set2` is a set created from `list2`; `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`; `result_list` is sorted based on the indices in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`.**
