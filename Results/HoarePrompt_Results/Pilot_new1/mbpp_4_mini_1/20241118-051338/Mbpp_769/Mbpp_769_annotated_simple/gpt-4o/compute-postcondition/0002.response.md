The code computes the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`, resulting in a new set `diff_elements` that contains elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both. The original sets `set1` and `set2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the presence of `diff_elements` based on the previous values of `set1` and `set2`.

Output State: **`set1` is a set created from `list1`; `list2` remains unchanged; `set2` is a set created from `list2`; `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`.**
