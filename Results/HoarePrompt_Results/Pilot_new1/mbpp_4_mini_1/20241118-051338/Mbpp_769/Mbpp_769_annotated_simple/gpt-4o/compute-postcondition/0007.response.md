Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both (i.e., the symmetric difference). The sorting is based on the original indices of these elements in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. **
