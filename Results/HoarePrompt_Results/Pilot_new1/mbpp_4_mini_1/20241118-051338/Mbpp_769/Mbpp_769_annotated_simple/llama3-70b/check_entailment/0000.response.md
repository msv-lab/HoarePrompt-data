To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the annotated code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function that gets the difference between two lists.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return sorted(list(set(list1) ^ set(list2)))
    # The program returns a sorted list of the unique elements that are in either list1 or list2, but not in both.
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Set Operation**: The code uses the symmetric difference operator (`^`) on sets created from `list1` and `list2`. This operation effectively finds elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. This aligns with the idea of finding the "difference" between two lists as described in the problem.

2. **Sorting the Result**: The result is then sorted before being returned. This ensures the output is in a predictable order, which can be beneficial for comparison or further processing.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If both lists are empty, the result will be an empty list, which is correct.
   - If one list is empty and the other contains elements, the result will be the sorted list of those elements, which is also correct.
   - If both lists contain the same elements, the result will again be an empty list, which is correct.
   - If there are unique elements in both lists, those will be returned correctly.

### Conclusion:
The annotated comment accurately describes the behavior of the code. The function correctly computes the symmetric difference, which is indeed the difference between the two lists as specified in the problem description.

### Final Assessment:
After considering various input scenarios and edge cases, the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description without any issues.

Correctness: **True**
