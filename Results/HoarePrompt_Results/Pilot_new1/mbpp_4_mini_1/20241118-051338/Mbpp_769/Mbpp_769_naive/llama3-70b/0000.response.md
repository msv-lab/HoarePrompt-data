To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(list1, list2)`.

The problem description states that the function should return the difference between two lists. The difference between two lists typically means the elements that are present in one list but not in the other.

The program uses the expression `list(set(list1) ^ set(list2))`, which computes the symmetric difference between the two sets created from the lists. The symmetric difference includes elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. This is not the same as the difference between two lists, which would normally mean elements that are in `list1` but not in `list2` and vice versa.

For example:
- If `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 3, 4]`, the expected difference would be `[1, 4]`, which are the elements unique to each list.
- However, the current implementation would return `[1, 4]` as well, which is correct in this case. 

But consider the case:
- If `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [1, 2, 3]`, the expected difference should be `[]`, but the program would return `[]` as well because there are no unique elements.

However, if we consider the case where `list1` contains duplicates:
- If `list1 = [1, 1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 3, 4]`, the expected difference should still return `[1, 4]`, which is correct. 

The issue arises when we consider that the symmetric difference does not account for the counts of elements. If we had:
- `list1 = [1, 1, 2]` and `list2 = [1]`, the expected difference would be `[1, 2]` since there are two 1s in `list1`, but the program would return `[2]` because it only considers the unique items.

Thus, the program does not handle cases where duplicates are involved correctly in the context of "difference" as typically defined.

Correctness: **False**.
