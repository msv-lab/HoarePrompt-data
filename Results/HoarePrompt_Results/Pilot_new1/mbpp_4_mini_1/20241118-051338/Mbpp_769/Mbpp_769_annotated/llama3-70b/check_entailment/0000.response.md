Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to compute the symmetric difference between two lists, returning a sorted list of elements that are in either list but not in both. However, it does not handle cases where the input types are not lists or where the lists contain non-hashable elements, which could lead to a TypeError.

For instance, if one of the inputs is a list containing a dictionary (which is non-hashable), the function would raise a TypeError when attempting to convert the list to a set. This is a significant limitation because the problem description does not specify that the inputs must be valid lists containing hashable elements.

The annotations mention that the function does not handle cases where the input types are not lists or contain non-hashable elements. This directly influences my reasoning, as it indicates that there are scenarios where the function will fail, thus not fulfilling the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Therefore, since the function does not work correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is deemed **False**.
