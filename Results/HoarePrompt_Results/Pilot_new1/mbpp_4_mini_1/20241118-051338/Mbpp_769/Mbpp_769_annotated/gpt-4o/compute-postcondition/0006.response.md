The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists containing elements of any type. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list of elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`, based on their indices in the combined lists. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of unique elements from both lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of elements that are unique to either list1 or list2.**
