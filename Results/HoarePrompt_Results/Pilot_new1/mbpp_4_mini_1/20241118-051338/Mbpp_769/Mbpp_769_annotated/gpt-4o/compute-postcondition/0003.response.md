The code converts the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2` into a list and assigns it to `result_list`. The values of `list1`, `set1`, `list2`, and `set2` remain unchanged. The value of `diff_elements`, which is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`, will determine the contents of `result_list`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and indicates the assignment of the symmetric difference to `result_list`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set of unique elements from `list1`, `list2` is a list containing elements of any type, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`, and `result_list` is the list converted from `diff_elements`.**
