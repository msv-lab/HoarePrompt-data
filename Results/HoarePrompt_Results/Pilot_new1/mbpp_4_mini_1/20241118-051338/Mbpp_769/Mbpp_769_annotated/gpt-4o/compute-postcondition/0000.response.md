The code assigns `set1` the value of `set(list1)`, which converts `list1` into a set, removing any duplicate elements and retaining only unique values. The variable `list2` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the state of `list1`, which is now represented as a set in `set1`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set of unique elements from `list1`, and `list2` is a list containing elements of any type**.
