The `result_list` is sorted in place based on the index of each element in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. The values of `list1`, `set1`, `list2`, `set2`, and `diff_elements` remain unchanged; only `result_list` is affected by the sorting operation. The sorting uses the indices from the concatenated list, which is `list1 + list2`. 

The output state reflects the unchanged variables and the sorted `result_list`. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any type, `set1` is a set of unique elements from `list1`, `list2` is a list containing elements of any type, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`, and `result_list` is sorted based on the index in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`.**
