The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both expected to be lists. It computes the symmetric difference between the two lists, which includes elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. The resulting elements are then converted into a list called `result_list`. This list is sorted based on the indices of its elements as they appear in the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. 

The function does not handle potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists containing duplicate elements, which may affect the final output. However, it will still return a sorted list of unique elements from the symmetric difference regardless of the input lists' contents. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in either list but not in both, sorted based on their original indices from the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. **
