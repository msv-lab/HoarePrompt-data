The code sorts `result_list` using a custom key that is based on the index of each element in the combined list `list1 + list2`. The previous values of the affected variables are `set1`, `list2`, `set2`, `diff_elements`, and `result_list`. The sorting operation will rearrange the elements in `result_list` according to their first occurrence in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`set1` is the set of unique elements from `list1`, `list2` remains unchanged, `set2` is the set of unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`, and `result_list` is sorted based on the indices from the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`.**
