The variable `result_list` is assigned the value of `list(diff_elements)`, which converts the symmetric difference `diff_elements` into a list. The initial states of `set1`, `list2`, `set2`, and `diff_elements` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged sets and lists, along with the new list created from the symmetric difference.

Output State: **`set1` is the set of unique elements from `list1`, `list2` remains unchanged, `set2` is the set of unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`, and `result_list` is the list of elements from `diff_elements`.**
