The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of elements that can be compared and sorted. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list named `result_list`, which is based on the indices from the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list that results from the concatenation of these two input lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list based on the concatenation of list1 and list2.**
