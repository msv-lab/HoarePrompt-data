Output State: **If `tup` is a tuple with at least one element and the first element `elem` is a tuple, the function returns the index of `elem` in `tup`. If `elem` is not a tuple, the function does not return any value. If `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute and the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None). If none of the elements in `tup` are tuples, the loop will execute for each element but will not return any value.**
