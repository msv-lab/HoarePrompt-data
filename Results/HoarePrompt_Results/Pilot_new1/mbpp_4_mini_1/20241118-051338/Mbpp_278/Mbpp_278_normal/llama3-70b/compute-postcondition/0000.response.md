According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. If `tup` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` will be the last element in the tuple. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the tuple must contain at least one element, and `elem` should be the first element in the tuple during the first iteration.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the tuple**
