According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in the tuple `tup`. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements. Therefore, if it has 3 elements, the loop will not execute again since all elements would have been iterated over. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `tup` to have at least 4 elements. The variable `elem` will also need to reflect the next element in the tuple, which would be the fourth element.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in the tuple**
