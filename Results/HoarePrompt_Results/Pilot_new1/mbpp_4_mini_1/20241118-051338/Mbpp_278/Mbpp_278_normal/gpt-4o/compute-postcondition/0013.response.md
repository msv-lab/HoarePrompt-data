The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The variable `tup` remains unchanged, and since `elem` does not affect the state in this case, the output state reflects the new value of `count`. 

Output State: **`count` is 5, `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, and `elem` is the third element of the tuple**
