According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in the tuple `tup` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 3, `tup` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element of the tuple. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `count` should be adjusted to reflect the index of the next element in the tuple, which would be 4 (indicating the fourth element). Additionally, `elem` should be updated to represent the next element in the tuple, which would be the third element.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `count` should be 4.
- `elem` should be the third element of the tuple.

State: **`count` is 4, `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element of the tuple**
