To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1(tup)`.

The function is supposed to count the number of elements that occur before the first tuple element in the given tuple. 

### Analysis of the Function:
1. The function initializes a counter `count` to zero.
2. It iterates over each element in the input tuple `tup`.
3. If it encounters an element that is a tuple (checked using `isinstance(elem, tuple)`), it breaks out of the loop.
4. If it does not encounter a tuple, it increments the count for each non-tuple element.
5. Finally, it returns the count.

### Provided Test Cases:
- `func_1((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10))` returns `3`, which correctly counts `1, 5, 7` before the tuple `(4, 6)`.
- `func_1((2, 9, (5, 7), 11))` returns `2`, which correctly counts `2, 9` before the tuple `(5, 7)`.
- `func_1((11, 15, 5, 8, (2, 3), 8))` returns `4`, which correctly counts `11, 15, 5, 8` before the tuple `(2, 3)`.

### Edge Cases:
Now, let's consider some additional edge cases:
1. If the input tuple does not contain any tuples:
   - `func_1((1, 2, 3))` should return `3` since there are no tuples.
2. If the input tuple starts with a tuple:
   - `func_1(((1, 2), 3, 4))` should return `0` since the first element is a tuple.
3. If the input tuple is empty:
   - `func_1(())` should return `0` since there are no elements.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. `func_1((1, 2, 3))` returns `3` (correct).
2. `func_1(((1, 2), 3, 4))` returns `0` (correct).
3. `func_1(())` returns `0` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The function behaves correctly for the provided test cases and the additional edge cases considered. It correctly counts the number of elements before the first tuple in all scenarios.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
