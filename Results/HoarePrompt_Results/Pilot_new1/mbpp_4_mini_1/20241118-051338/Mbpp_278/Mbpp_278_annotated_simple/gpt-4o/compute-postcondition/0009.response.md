The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The value of `tup` and `elem` remain unaffected by this operation. The output state reflects the updated value of `count`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `count` is 3, and `elem` is the second element of `tup`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `count` is 3, and `elem` is the second element of `tup`**
