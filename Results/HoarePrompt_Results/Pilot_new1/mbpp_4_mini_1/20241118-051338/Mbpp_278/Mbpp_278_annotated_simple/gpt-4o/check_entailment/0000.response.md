To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations thoroughly.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that counts the number of elements that occur before a tuple element in a given tuple.

### Annotated Program
```python
def func_1(tup):
    count = 0
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            break
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` is the number of elements in `tup` before the first nested tuple is encountered. If `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If the first element of `tup` is a nested tuple, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `tup` contains only non-tuple elements, `count` will equal the length of `tup`.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of non-tuple elements in the tuple 'tup' before the first nested tuple is encountered
```

### Analysis
1. **Functionality**: The function iterates over each element in the tuple `tup`. It counts the number of elements until it encounters the first nested tuple. If it finds a tuple, it breaks the loop and returns the count of non-tuple elements encountered so far.

2. **Empty Tuple**: If `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function correctly returns 0.

3. **First Element is a Tuple**: If the first element of `tup` is a tuple, the loop does not execute, and the function also correctly returns 0.

4. **All Non-Tuple Elements**: If all elements are non-tuple, the function will return the total count of elements in `tup`, which is expected.

5. **Nested Tuples**: The function correctly handles cases where there are multiple nested tuples, only counting elements until the first nested tuple.

### Potential Edge Cases
- If the tuple contains only one element which is a tuple, the function should return 0.
- If the tuple contains multiple elements, and the first element is a tuple, the function should return 0.
- If the tuple is completely empty, it should return 0.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of non-tuple elements before encountering the first tuple, and it handles all edge cases as per the problem description.

Since I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement, I conclude that the code is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
