The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple containing elements, where at least one element is a tuple. 

- If `tup` contains at least one tuple, the function returns the index of the first tuple found in `tup`. 
- If `tup` does not contain any tuples or if `tup` is empty, the function does not execute the loop and there is no return value. 
- Additionally, the function returns the number of elements in the tuple `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the index of the first tuple found within it, or the number of elements in `tup` if no tuples are present. If `tup` is empty, there is no return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, returns the index of the first tuple found in tup if present; otherwise, it returns the number of elements in tup. If tup is empty, there is no return value.**
