The code appends `element` (which is the third element of `nested_list`) to `flat_list`. The value of `flat_list` will change as it will now include `element`, while the states of `nested_list` and `element` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `element`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `element`**
