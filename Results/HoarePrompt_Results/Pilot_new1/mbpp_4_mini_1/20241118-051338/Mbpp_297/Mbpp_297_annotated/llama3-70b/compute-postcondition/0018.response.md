The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both. After executing the function body, it returns a flattened list containing all elements from `nested_list`, regardless of their nesting level. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list` and return a single flattened list with all elements extracted from it. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list containing integers and/or other lists, and returns a flattened list containing all elements from nested_list.**
