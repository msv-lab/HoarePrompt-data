According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, and `element` is the third element in that list. For the loop to be executed one more time, we need to ensure that `element` is updated to the fourth element in the `nested_list`.

Since `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, it must also have a fourth element for the loop to continue. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `element` is now the fourth element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 4 elements, `element` is the fourth element in that list.**
