The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `nested_list` remains unaffected, as no operations are performed on it in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is that `nested_list` can still contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both, and `flat_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both; `flat_list` is an empty list**
