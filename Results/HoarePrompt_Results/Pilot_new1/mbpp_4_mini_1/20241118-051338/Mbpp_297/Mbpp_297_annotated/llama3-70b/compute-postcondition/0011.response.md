According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, and `element` is the second element in that list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements, and `element` should be updated to the third element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the list**
