To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the annotations.

### Problem Description
The function is required to:
1. Accept a nested list that may contain integers or other lists.
2. Return a flattened list containing all integers from the nested list.
3. If the input is empty or contains only other lists, the output should also be an empty list.
4. The function must correctly handle mixed types, recursively flattening any inner lists it encounters.

### Annotations and Code Analysis
The annotated program performs the following:
- It initializes an empty list `flat_list`.
- It iterates through each item in `nested_list`.
- If an item is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that item and extends `flat_list` with the result.
- If the item is not a list, it appends the item directly to `flat_list`.
- Finally, it returns `flat_list`.

The annotations state:
- After the for loop, `flat_list` contains all integers from `nested_list`, flattened from any inner lists.
- If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains empty.
- If `nested_list` contains only non-list items, `flat_list` will contain those items directly.
- If `nested_list` contains a mix of lists and integers, `flat_list` will include all integers and the flattened results of any inner lists processed by `func_1`.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Empty Input:** If `nested_list` is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list.
2. **Non-list Items Only:** If `nested_list` contains only integers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), the function returns the same list.
3. **Nested Lists:** If `nested_list` is deeply nested (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]]]`), the function should flatten it correctly to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
4. **Mixed Types:** If `nested_list` contains a mix of integers and lists (e.g., `[1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]]`), the function should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Conclusion
The program appears to handle all the described cases correctly. The annotations align with the functionality of the code, confirming that the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

Since there are no identified edge cases where the code fails to meet the problem description, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly flattens nested lists, handles empty cases, and processes mixed types as described in the problem statement.
