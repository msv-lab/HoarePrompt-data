According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 items, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 item, which means there is at least one item processed. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `nested_list` must have at least 2 items. The `item` should be updated to reflect the next item in the list, which will be the second item.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, item is the second item in `nested_list`**
