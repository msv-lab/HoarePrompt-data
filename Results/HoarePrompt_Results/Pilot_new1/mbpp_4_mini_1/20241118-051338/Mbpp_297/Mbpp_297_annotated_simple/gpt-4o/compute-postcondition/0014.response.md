Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items. If each `item` in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the results of `func_1(item)` for each such `item`. If any `item` is not a list, that `item` is appended to `flat_list`. In cases where `nested_list` contains a mix of lists and non-lists, `flat_list` will include the flattened results from all lists and all individual non-list items.***
