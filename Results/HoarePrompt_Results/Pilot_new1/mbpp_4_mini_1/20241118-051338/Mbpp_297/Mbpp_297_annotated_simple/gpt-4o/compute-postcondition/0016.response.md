Output State: **`flat_list` contains all non-list items from `nested_list` and the flattened elements from any lists within `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `flat_list` remains empty. If `nested_list` contains only lists, `flat_list` will be populated with the flattened results of all lists. If `nested_list` contains only non-list items, `flat_list` will include all those items directly.**
