The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both. After executing the function body, it returns a flattened list `flat_list` containing all non-list items from `nested_list` as well as the flattened elements from any lists within `nested_list`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list` and return a new list that includes all integers and elements from any nested lists, effectively flattening the structure. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that can contain integers or other lists, and returns a flattened list containing all non-list items and the flattened elements from any lists within nested_list.**
