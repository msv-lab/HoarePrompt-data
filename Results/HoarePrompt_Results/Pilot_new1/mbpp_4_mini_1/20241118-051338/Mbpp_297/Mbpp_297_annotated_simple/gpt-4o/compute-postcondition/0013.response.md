The code `flat_list.append(item)` appends `item` to the list `flat_list`. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, but the state of `flat_list` and `item` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `flat_list` is modified by adding `item`, but we do not know the exact contents of `flat_list` or the value of `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, and `item` is appended to `flat_list`**
