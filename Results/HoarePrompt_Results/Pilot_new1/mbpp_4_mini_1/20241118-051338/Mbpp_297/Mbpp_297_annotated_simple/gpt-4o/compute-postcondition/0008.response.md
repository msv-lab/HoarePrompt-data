The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` calls the function `func_1` with `item` as an argument and extends `flat_list` with the result of that function. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` has at least 2 items, so `item` is defined as the second item in the list.

The output state will reflect that `flat_list` is updated with the results from `func_1(item)`, but we do not know the specific values of `flat_list` or the output of `func_1(item)` based on the initial state provided. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `flat_list` has been modified.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list, and `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`**
