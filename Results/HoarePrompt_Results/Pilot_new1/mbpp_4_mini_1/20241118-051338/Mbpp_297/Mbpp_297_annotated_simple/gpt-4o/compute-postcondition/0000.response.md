The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The state of `nested_list` is not affected by this assignment, and it remains a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both; `flat_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both; `flat_list` is an empty list**
