According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, so we need to adjust it to ensure there is a third element.

The `element` variable will be updated to the next element in the `nested_list`, which will be the third element. Therefore, we need to specify that `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements, and the `element` will be the third element in that list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, element is the third element in the list**
