The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(element))` takes the third element from `nested_list` which is referred to as `element`. The function `func_1(element)` is called with `element` as an argument, and it is assumed to return a list or iterable. The `extend` method then adds the elements returned by `func_1(element)` to `flat_list`. The state of `nested_list` is not changed, and we do not know the exact output of `func_1(element)` without its definition.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `nested_list` and the modification to `flat_list` due to the extension.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`**.
