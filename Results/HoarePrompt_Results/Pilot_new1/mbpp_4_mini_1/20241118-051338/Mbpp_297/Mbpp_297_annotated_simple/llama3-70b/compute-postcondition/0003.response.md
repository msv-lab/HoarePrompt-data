The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(element))` calls a function `func_1` with `element` as the argument and extends `flat_list` with the result of that function call. The initial state indicates that `flat_list` is empty and `element` is a list. 

Since we do not have information about the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact contents that will be added to `flat_list`. However, we know that `flat_list` will be extended with the result of `func_1(element)`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged state of `nested_list`, the empty state of `flat_list` before the extension, and the fact that `flat_list` will now contain the elements returned by `func_1(element)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is extended with the output of `func_1(element)`, and `element` is a list**.
