Output State: **`flat_list` contains all non-list elements from `nested_list`, as well as the flattened contents of any nested lists within `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute and `flat_list` remains empty. If `nested_list` contains only non-list elements, all those elements will be in `flat_list`. If it contains only nested lists, `flat_list` will contain the flattened results of those nested lists.**
