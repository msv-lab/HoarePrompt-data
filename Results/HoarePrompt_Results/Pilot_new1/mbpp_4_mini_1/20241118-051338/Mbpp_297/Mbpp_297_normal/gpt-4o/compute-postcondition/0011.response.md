According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 3 items, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 items, and `item` is the second item in the list. For the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 items, and `item` should be the third item in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, item is the third item in the list**
