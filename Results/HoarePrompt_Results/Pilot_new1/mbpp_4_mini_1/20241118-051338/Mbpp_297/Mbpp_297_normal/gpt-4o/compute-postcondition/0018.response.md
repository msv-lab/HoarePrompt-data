The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists. After executing the function body, it returns a flat list that includes all non-list elements from `nested_list` as well as the flattened contents of any nested lists within `nested_list`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list` and return a flattened list containing all non-list elements and the contents of any nested lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists, and returns a flattened list containing all non-list elements and the contents of any nested lists.**
