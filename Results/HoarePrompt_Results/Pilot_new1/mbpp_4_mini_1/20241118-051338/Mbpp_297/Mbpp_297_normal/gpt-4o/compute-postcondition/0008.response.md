The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` extends the `flat_list` by adding the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. The variable `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`, and the state of `flat_list` will change as it will now include the results of `func_1(item)`. The previous values of `flat_list` and `item` are not specified, but `item` is known to be the second item in the `nested_list`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `flat_list` after the extension and indicates that `item` has been used in the function call.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list, and `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)`**
