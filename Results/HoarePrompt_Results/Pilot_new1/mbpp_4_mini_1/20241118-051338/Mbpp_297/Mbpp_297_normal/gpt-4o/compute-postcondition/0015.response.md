According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 4 items, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 3 items. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 4 items, and `item` should be the fourth item in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 4 items, item is the fourth item in the list**
