Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items. If the third item in the list (`item`) is itself a list, `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)`. If `item` is not a list, `flat_list` includes `item`. This ensures that `flat_list` will either contain the flattened contents of `item` or the value of `item` itself, depending on its type.***
