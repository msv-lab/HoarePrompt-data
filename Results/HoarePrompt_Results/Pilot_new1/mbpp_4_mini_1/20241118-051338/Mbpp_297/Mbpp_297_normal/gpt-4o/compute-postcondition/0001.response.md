According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the `nested_list` contains at least 1 item, the loop will execute. Since `flat_list` is empty before the loop starts, it does not affect the loop's ability to execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nested_list` must contain at least 1 item. At the start of the loop, `item` should be the first element of `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first element of `nested_list`**
