The code appends `item` to `flat_list`. Since `flat_list` is initially an empty list, after the execution, `flat_list` will contain `item` as its first element. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `flat_list` contains `item`, and `item` is not a list but an element of a different type.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `flat_list` contains `item`, and `item` is not a list but an element of a different type**
