According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, and `element` is the third element of that list. To prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `element` should now be the fourth element in `nested_list`, and the total number of elements in `nested_list` should be at least 4. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 4 elements, `element` is the fourth element of that list.**
