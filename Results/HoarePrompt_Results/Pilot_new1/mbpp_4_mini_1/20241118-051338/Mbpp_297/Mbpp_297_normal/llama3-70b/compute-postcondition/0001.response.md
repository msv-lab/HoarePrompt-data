According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the `nested_list` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. Since `flat_list` is empty at the start, it does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `nested_list` must contain at least one element, and the `element` will be set to the first element of the `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`**
