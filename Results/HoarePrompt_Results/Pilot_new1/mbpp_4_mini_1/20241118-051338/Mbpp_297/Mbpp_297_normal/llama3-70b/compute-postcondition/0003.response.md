The `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`, where `element` is the first element of `nested_list`. The value of `flat_list` was previously empty, so it will now contain whatever is returned by `func_1(element)`. The state of `nested_list` and `element` does not change, but the state of `flat_list` will be updated. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `flat_list` and the unchanged `nested_list` and `element`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is updated with the result of func_1(element), `element` is the first element of `nested_list`**
