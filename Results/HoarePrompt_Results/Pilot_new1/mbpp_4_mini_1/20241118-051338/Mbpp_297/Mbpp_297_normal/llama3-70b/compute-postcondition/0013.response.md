The code appends the value of `element` to `flat_list`. The value of `element` is specified as the third element in the `nested_list`. The `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, so `element` has a defined value. The state of `flat_list` is not provided, but it will now include `element`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `nested_list` and the updated state of `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements; `flat_list` has `element` appended to it**
