The code `flat_list.append(element)` adds `element` to the list `flat_list`. The previous state indicates that `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, and `element` is defined as the second element in `nested_list`. Therefore, after executing the code, `flat_list` will include the second element of `nested_list`. The states of `nested_list` and `element` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `element`.**
