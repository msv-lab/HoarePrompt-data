Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle cases where the radius or height of the cylinder is zero or negative. According to the mathematical definition of the volume of a cylinder, if either the radius or height is less than or equal to zero, the volume should logically be zero or undefined. 

For example:
- `func_1(0, 5)` should return `0`, but it will return `0.0` which is mathematically correct but does not align with a meaningful interpretation of a cylinder with zero radius.
- `func_1(-1, 5)` should not produce a valid volume, as a negative radius does not correspond to a physical cylinder.

Since the program does not account for these edge cases, it is incorrect.
