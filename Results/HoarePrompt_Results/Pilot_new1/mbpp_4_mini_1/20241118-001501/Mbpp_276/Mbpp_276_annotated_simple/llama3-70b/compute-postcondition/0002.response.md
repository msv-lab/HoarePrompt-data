Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which should be non-negative real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula π * radius² * height. However, the function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are negative, which could result in an incorrect volume calculation. It also does not check for the validity of the input types, which could lead to runtime errors if non-numeric values are provided. **
