The variable `volume` is assigned the value of the expression `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The values of `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, `volume` will be a non-negative real number calculated based on those values. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers; `volume` is calculated as math.pi * radius ** 2 * height**
