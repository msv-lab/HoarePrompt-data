The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula π * radius² * height. It returns the computed volume. However, the annotations incorrectly state that it returns the volume calculated as `math.pi * radius`, omitting the necessary multiplication by `height`. There are no checks for negative or zero values for `radius` and `height`, which could lead to invalid results or a non-physical volume.
