The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are expected to be non-negative real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula π * radius² * height. However, the function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` is negative, which would be invalid inputs for calculating a physical volume.
