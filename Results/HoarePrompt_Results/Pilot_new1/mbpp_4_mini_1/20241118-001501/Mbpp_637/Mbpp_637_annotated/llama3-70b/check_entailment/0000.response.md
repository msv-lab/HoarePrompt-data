Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that there is neither profit nor loss, and `False` otherwise.

The annotations clarify that the function's purpose is to determine if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, which aligns perfectly with the requirement of checking for no profit and no loss. Since the only condition for no profit and no loss is that the cost price and selling price must be the same, the function handles this scenario correctly without any missing logic or edge cases.

I did not identify any potential cases where the function would fail to meet the problem description, and the annotations corroborate the function's intended behavior. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases outlined in the problem description.
