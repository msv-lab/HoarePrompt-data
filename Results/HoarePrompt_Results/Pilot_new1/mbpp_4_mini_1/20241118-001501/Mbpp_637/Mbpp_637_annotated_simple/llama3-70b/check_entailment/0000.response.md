Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of checking whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the cost price and selling price. The function `func_1` returns `True` if both prices are equal, indicating that there is neither profit nor loss. If they are not equal, it returns `False`, which is also correct behavior as it indicates a profit or loss situation.

I cannot think of any case where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct for all potential inputs.
