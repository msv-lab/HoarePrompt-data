Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns True if they are equal; otherwise, it returns False. It does not account for any specific edge cases, such as handling non-numeric inputs or types that cannot be compared, but it will return False if such comparisons are attempted. **
