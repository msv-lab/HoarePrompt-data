Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. The function `func_1` compares the `cost_price` and `selling_price`, returning `True` if they are equal (indicating no profit, no loss) and `False` otherwise.

The assertions provided in the program confirm that it behaves as expected for the following cases:
- `func_1(1500, 1200)` returns `False`, which is correct since the selling price is less than the cost price (indicating a loss).
- `func_1(100, 100)` returns `True`, which is correct since the selling price equals the cost price (indicating no profit, no loss).
- `func_1(2000, 5000)` returns `False`, which is correct since the selling price is greater than the cost price (indicating a profit).

Since all potential cases tested return the expected results according to the problem description, the program is correct.
