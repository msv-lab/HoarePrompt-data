To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem and the code.

**Problem Description:** The function should take a non-negative number and return the count of prime numbers less than that number.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
    return sum(is_prime)
```

**Step-by-step Breakdown:**
1. The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If so, it correctly returns 0 because there are no prime numbers less than 2.
2. It initializes a list `is_prime` of length `n` with all values set to `True`, indicating that all numbers are initially considered prime.
3. The function explicitly marks 0 and 1 as not prime.
4. It then uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each prime `i`, it marks all multiples of `i` starting from `i*i` as not prime.
5. Finally, it sums the `True` values in `is_prime`, which gives the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

**Testing Cases:**
- `func_1(5)` returns 2 (primes are 2, 3).
- `func_1(10)` returns 4 (primes are 2, 3, 5, 7).
- `func_1(100)` returns 25 (primes less than 100).

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 0 or 1, it correctly returns 0.
- If `n` is 2, it correctly returns 0.

After analyzing the function and testing it against the problem description, it appears to be functioning correctly for all valid inputs as per the description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly implements the logic to count prime numbers less than a given non-negative number, handling edge cases appropriately.
