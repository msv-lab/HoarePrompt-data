The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`, where `j` is 24. The initial state indicates that `is_prime[24]` is not explicitly mentioned, but since `is_prime[20]` is set to False, it suggests that the array might be tracking the primality of numbers. However, the specific value of `is_prime[24]` is not stated. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 24, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime[16]` is False, `is_prime[20]` is False, and `is_prime[24]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 24, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime[16]` is False, `is_prime[20]` is False, and `is_prime[24]` is set to False**
