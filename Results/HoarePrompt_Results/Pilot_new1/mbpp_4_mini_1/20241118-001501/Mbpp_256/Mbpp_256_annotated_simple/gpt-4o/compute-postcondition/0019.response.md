According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 9, and `n` is greater than 9. 

To determine the next state at the start of the next iteration:
- The current value of `j` is 9.
- The next value of `j` will be calculated as `j + i`, which is `9 + 3 = 12`.
- Since `n` is greater than 9, we need to ensure that `j` (which will be 12) is still less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to 12 and ensure that `n` is greater than 12.

State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, `is_prime[9]` is False**
