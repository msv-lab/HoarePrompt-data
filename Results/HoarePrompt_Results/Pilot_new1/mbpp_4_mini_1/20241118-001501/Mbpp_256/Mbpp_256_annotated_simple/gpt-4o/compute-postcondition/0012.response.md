The code sets `is_prime[j]` to `False`. The value of `j` is 8, so `is_prime[8]` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of `is_prime[4]` and `is_prime[6]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 8, `i` is 2, `j` is 8, `is_prime[4]` is now `False`, `is_prime[6]` is now `False`, and `is_prime[8]` is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 8, `i` is 2, `j` is 8, `is_prime[4]` is now `False`, `is_prime[6]` is now `False`, `is_prime[8]` is now `False`**
