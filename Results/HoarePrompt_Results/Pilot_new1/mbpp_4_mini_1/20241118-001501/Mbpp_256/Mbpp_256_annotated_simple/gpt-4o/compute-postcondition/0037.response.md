Output State: **If n is 0 or 1, then is_prime is empty. If n is 2 or more, is_prime has the first two elements set to False. If n is at least 2, the loop will execute starting with i = 2. If is_prime[i] is True and n is at least i * i, then all multiples of i from i * i to n will be set to False in is_prime. If is_prime[i] is False or if n is less than i * i, is_prime remains unchanged. The loop will execute for values of i up to âˆšn (inclusive), and if n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, leaving is_prime unchanged.**
