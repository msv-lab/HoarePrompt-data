The value at index `j` of `is_prime` is set to `False`. Since `j` is 4, this means `is_prime[4]` is updated to `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the element at index `i` of `is_prime` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `is_prime[4]` is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `is_prime[4]` is now `False**
