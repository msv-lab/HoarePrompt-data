The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`. The value of `j` is 9, so `is_prime[9]` is set to `False`. The initial state indicates that `is_prime` has the first two elements set to `False`, but the values of other indices are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `is_prime` at index 9 while leaving the other variables unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, `is_prime[9]` is False**
