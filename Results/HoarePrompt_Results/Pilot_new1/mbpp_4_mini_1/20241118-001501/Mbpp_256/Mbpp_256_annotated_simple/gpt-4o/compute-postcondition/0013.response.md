According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 8 and `n` is greater than 8. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value calculated by the expression `j + i`. Since `i` is 2, the next value of `j` will be `8 + 2 = 10`. 

Now we need to check if this new value of `j` (which is 10) is still less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 8, we can conclude that `j` (10) will be less than `n` if `n` is greater than 10. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state as follows: `j` should be 10, and `n` must be greater than 10.

State: **`n` is greater than 10, `i` is 2, `j` is 10, `is_prime[4]` is now `False`, `is_prime[6]` is now `False`, `is_prime[8]` is now `False`**
