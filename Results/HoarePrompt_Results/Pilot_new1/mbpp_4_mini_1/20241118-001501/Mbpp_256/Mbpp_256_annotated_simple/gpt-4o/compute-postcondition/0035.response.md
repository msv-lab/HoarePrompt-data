Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 16 and `i` is 4. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then all multiples of 4 starting from 16 up to but not including `n` (such as `is_prime[16]`, `is_prime[20]`, and `is_prime[24]` if `n` is at least 25) will be set to False. If `is_prime[i]` is False, the `is_prime` array remains unchanged.***
