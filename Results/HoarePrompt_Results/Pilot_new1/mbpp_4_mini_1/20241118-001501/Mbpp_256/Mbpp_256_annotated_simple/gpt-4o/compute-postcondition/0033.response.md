According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 24, and `n` is greater than 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value in the range, which would be `j + i`. Since `i` is 4, the next value of `j` will be 28. 

Now, we need to ensure that `j` (which is now 28) is still less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 24, we can assume that `n` must also be greater than 28 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `j` is updated to 28.
- `n` must be greater than 28.

State: **`n` is greater than 28, `i` is 4, `j` is 28, `is_prime[16]` is False, `is_prime[20]` is False, and `is_prime[24]` is set to False**
