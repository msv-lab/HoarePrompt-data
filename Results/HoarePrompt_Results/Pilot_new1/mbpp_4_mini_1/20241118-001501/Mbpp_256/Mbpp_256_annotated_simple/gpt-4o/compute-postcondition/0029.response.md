According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 16, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 16. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `i` (which is 4). Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `16 + 4 = 20`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 16, it must also be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than 20 to allow for another iteration.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` should be updated to 20.
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 20.

State: **`n` is greater than 20, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[16]` is set to `False`**
