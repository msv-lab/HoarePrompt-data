Output State: **`is_prime` has all multiples of `i` from `i * i` to `n` set to `False`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is the first multiple of `i` starting from `i * i`, which is 4. The loop will execute for each valid multiple of `i` until reaching `n`.**
