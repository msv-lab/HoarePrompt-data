According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 6, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 6. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the next value of `j`. The current value of `j` is 6, and since `i` is 2, the next value of `j` will be calculated as `j + i`, which is `6 + 2 = 8`. 

Now we check the condition: `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Since `n` is greater than 6, `j` being 8 will still satisfy the condition as long as `n` is greater than 8.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now 8. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 8 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 8, `i` is 2, `j` is 8, `is_prime[4]` is now `False`, and `is_prime[6]` is now `False`**
