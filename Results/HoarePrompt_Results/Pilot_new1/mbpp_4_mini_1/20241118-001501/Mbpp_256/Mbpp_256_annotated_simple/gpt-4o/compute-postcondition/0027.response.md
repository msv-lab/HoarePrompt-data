According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `i`, `j`, and `n`. The variable `j` will start at `i * i`, which is `4 * 4 = 16`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`, and it increments `j` by `i` in each iteration.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 16, the loop can execute as long as `j` starts at 16 (which it does, since `i` is 4). Therefore, the loop can execute at least once since `j` (16) is equal to `n` (in the case where `n` is exactly 16).

At the end of the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by `i` (which is 4), making `j` equal to 20 if the loop continues. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the current states are sufficient. The values of `i` and `n` allow the loop to run, and `j` will start at 16.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 16**
