The code sets `is_prime[j]` to `False`. The value of `j` is 16, so `is_prime[16]` is assigned `False`. The other variables `n` and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 16, and `is_prime[16]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 16, and `is_prime[16]` is set to `False**
