According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `num`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `num` is 2 or greater, we need to determine if `i` can be incremented and still allow the loop to execute again. The next value of `i` would be 3. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to check if `i` (which will become 3) is still less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. This means that `num` must be at least 9 (since the square root of 9 is 3). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `num` to be at least 9.

State: **`num` is 9 or greater, `i` is 3**
