According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. The loop will only execute if `num` is at least 2, as it starts iterating from 2. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False and the loop does not execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `num` must be at least 2. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 2, which is the starting point of the range in the loop. The upper limit of the range is calculated as `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, which will be valid as long as `num` is 2 or greater.

State: **`num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2**
