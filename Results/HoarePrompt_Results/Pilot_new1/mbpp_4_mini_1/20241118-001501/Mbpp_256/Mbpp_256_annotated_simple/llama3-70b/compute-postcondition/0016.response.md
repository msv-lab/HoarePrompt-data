The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a non-negative integer. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`. If `num` is 2 or greater, the function checks for divisibility by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function does not return anything, implying that `num` is prime. Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and return `False` if `num` is less than 2 or not prime; otherwise, it does not return anything, indicating that `num` is prime.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `num`, returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or not prime; otherwise, it does not return anything, indicating that `num` is prime.**
