The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if it is not a prime number (i.e., it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`). If `num` is 2 or greater and is not divisible by any of those integers, the function returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).
