Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns the count of prime numbers less than `n`. 

The inner function `is_prime` accurately checks if a number is prime by returning `False` for numbers less than 2 and checking divisibility for numbers 2 and above. The outer loop iterates through all numbers from 2 to `n-1`, counting how many of these numbers are prime.

The function handles edge cases as follows:
- If `n` is 0 or 1, the range for the loop becomes empty, resulting in a count of 0, which is correct since there are no prime numbers less than 0 or 1.
- For any other non-negative integer, it counts the prime numbers correctly.

Since the program works correctly for all potential inputs as per the problem description, I conclude that it is correct.
