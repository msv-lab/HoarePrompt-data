According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `i` is less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `num` is greater than or equal to 2, we can conclude that `int(num ** 0.5)` will also be at least 1, making `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` at least 2. Therefore, `i` can take on values of 2, 3, etc., until it reaches `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` should be adjusted to 3. The state of `num` does not need to be adjusted, as the condition of `num` being greater than or equal to 2 is already satisfied.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3**
