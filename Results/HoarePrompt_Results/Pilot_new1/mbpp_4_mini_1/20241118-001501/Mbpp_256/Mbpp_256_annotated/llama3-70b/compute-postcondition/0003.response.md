According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop is designed to iterate from 2 to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `num` must be at least 2, as the range starts at 2. If `num` is less than 2, the function will return False, and the loop will not execute.

Since `num` is a non-negative integer, if `num` is exactly 2, the loop will execute once (with `i` being 2). If `num` is greater than 2, the loop will execute for multiple iterations depending on the value of `num`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num` must be at least 2, and `i` should start at 2.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
