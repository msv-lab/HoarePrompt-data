According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. Since `num` is greater than or equal to 9, we can determine the value of `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. The smallest value for `num` is 9, which gives `int(9 ** 0.5) + 1 = 4`. Therefore, if `num` is exactly 9, the loop will not execute again since `i` is equal to the upper limit. However, if `num` is greater than 9, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` will be greater than 4, allowing the loop to execute again.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `num` must be greater than 9, and `i` must be incremented to 5.

State: **`num` is greater than 9, `i` is 5**
