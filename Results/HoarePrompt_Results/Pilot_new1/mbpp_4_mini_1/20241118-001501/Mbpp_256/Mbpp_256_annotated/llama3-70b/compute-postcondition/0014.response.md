Output State: **If `num` is at least 2, the loop checks divisibility of `num` by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any of these integers, the function does not return a value, implying that `num` may be prime. If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the function returns False.**
