According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the expression `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. Since `n` is at least 2, `int(n ** 0.5)` will be at least 1, making `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` at least 2. Therefore, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than 2.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to increment `i` from 2 to 3. The value of `n` does not need to change since it is already at least 2. 

Thus, the adjusted states would be:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3**
