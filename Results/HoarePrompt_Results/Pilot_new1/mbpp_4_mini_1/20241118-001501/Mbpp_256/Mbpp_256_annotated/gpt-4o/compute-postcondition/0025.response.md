Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2. If `is_prime[i]` is True and `n` is at least 4, all multiples of 2 starting from 4 up to `n` are marked as False in the `is_prime` array. If `is_prime[i]` is False or if `n` is less than 4, the `is_prime` array remains unchanged for those indices.***
