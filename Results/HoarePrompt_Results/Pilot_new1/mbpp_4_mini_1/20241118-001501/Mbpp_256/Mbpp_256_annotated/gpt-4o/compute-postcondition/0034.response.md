The loop marks non-prime numbers in the `is_prime` list starting from `i * i` and increments by `i` until it reaches `n`. The loop will execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. If `i * i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute.

Output State: **If `n` is greater than `i * i`, then `is_prime[j]` is set to `False` for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to but not including `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged.**
