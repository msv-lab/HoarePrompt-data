According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 8, `n` is greater than 8, and `i` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value in the range, which is `j + i`. Since `j` is currently 8 and `i` is 2, the next value of `j` will be 10. 

Now we check the condition: 
- The new value of `j` (10) must be less than `n` (which is greater than 8). This condition will hold true as long as `n` is greater than 10.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` needs to be updated to 10.
- `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 10 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 10, `i` is 2, `j` is 10, `is_prime[6]` is False, and `is_prime[8]` is set to False**
