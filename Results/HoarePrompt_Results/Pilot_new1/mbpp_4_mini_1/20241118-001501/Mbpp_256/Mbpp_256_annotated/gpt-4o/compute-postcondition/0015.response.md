Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, the corresponding entries in `is_prime` are set to False. If `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, or if `n` is exactly 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for those indices.***
