According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined for `j`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i * i + i`, and since `is_prime[j]` is now False, we know that the loop has been marking multiples of `i` as non-prime.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is less than the square root of `n`, we need to ensure that `j` is still within the bounds of `n` for the loop to run again. 

Since `j` is currently `i * i + i`, we need to check if this value is less than `n`. If `j` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is adjusted to be less than `n`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we can increment `j` to the next multiple of `i`:

- The current value of `j` is `i * i + i`. 
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to `i * i + 2 * i` (the next multiple of `i`).

Thus, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `n`, and we can adjust `j` accordingly.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `j` is now `i * i + 2 * i`, `i` is less than the square root of `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False.**
