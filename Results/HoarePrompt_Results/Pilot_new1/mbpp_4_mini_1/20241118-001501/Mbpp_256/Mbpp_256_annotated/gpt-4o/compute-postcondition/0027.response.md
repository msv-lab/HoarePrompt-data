According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop is structured to start from `i * i` and increment by `i` until it reaches `n`. 

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 3, we can compute the starting point of the loop:
- The starting value for `j` would be `i * i`, which is `3 * 3 = 9`.

Now we need to check if the starting value `9` is less than `n`. Since `n` is at least `2`, the loop will not execute because the starting value `9` is greater than `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that the starting value `9` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `9`.

Additionally, we need to set the initial value of `j` to the starting value of the loop, which is `9`.

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9**
