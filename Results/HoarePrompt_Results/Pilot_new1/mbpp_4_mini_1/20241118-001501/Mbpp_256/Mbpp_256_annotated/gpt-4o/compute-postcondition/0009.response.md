According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from `i * i` to `n`, with a step of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i * i`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, we need to ensure that `j` is updated correctly for the next iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to update `j` to the next value in the range, which would be `j + i`. We also need to ensure that this updated value of `j` is still less than `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to `j + i` and ensure that it remains less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `j` is now `i * i + i`, `i` is less than the square root of `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False.**
