Output State: **`is_prime[j]` is set to False for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, where `j` takes values `i * i`, `i * i + i`, `i * i + 2 * i`, etc. If `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for those indices. If `n` is exactly 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged.**
