According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute if the starting value for `j`, which is `i * i`, is less than `n`. 

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we need to ensure that `i` is a valid index such that `i * i < n`. This means `i` must be less than the square root of `n`. Additionally, since the loop is iterating over the range starting from `i * i`, we need to set `j` to `i * i` before the loop starts.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
- `i` is less than the square root of `n` (to ensure `i * i < n`)
- `j` is initialized to `i * i`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1` if `n > 1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `j` is `i * i`, `i` is less than the square root of `n`**
