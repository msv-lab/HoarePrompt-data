According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as the starting point `i * i` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is currently 2, we calculate `i * i` which equals 4. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop will not execute because 4 is not less than 2. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than or equal to 4. Additionally, `j` should be initialized to `i * i`, which is 4.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
