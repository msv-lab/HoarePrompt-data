According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition for the next value of `i`. The next value of `i` would be 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 16 (since `int(n ** 0.5)` must be at least 4 for `i` to be 4).

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` is at least 16. The value of `i` will change to 4 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4**
