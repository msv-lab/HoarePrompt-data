According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to calculate the next value of `j`. The current value of `j` is 4, and it will be updated to `j + i` in the next iteration. Since `i` is 2, the next value of `j` will be 6. 

At that point, we need to ensure that `j` (which will be 6) is still less than `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` must be greater than 6 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, and `is_prime[4]` is set to `False`**
