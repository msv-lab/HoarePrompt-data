According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 12 and `n` is greater than 12. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value in the range defined by `range(i * i, n, i)`. 

Since `i` is 3, the starting point for `j` is `i * i`, which is 9. The next value for `j` in the sequence generated by `range(9, n, 3)` after 12 would be 15 (9, 12, 15, ...). Therefore, `j` needs to be updated to 15.

The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is still greater than 12.

State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[9]` is False, and `is_prime[12]` is set to False**
