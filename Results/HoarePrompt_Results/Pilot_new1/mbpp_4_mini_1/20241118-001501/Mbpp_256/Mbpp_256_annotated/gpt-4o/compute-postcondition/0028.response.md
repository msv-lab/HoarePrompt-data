The code assigns the value `False` to `is_prime[j]`. The value of `j` is 9, which indicates that `is_prime[9]` will be set to `False`. The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, and `is_prime[9]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, and `is_prime[9]` is set to `False**
