According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Since `num` is 9 or greater, we need to determine whether `i` can be incremented without exceeding `int(num ** 0.5)`.

1. If `num` is exactly 9, then `int(num ** 0.5)` is 3. In this case, the loop will not execute again because `i` (which is 3) is not less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)` (which is also 3).
2. If `num` is greater than 9, then `int(num ** 0.5)` will be greater than 3, allowing the loop to execute again. Thus, we need to adjust `num` to ensure it is greater than 9 (at least 10) to allow for further iterations.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `num` to be greater than 9 while keeping `i` at 3.

State: **`num` is greater than 9, `i` is 3**
