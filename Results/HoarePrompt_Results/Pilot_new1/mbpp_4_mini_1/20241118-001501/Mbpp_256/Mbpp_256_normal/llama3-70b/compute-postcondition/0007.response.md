According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition defined by the range. The loop iterates with `i` starting from 2 up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `num` is 2 or greater. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3 for the next iteration. 

The upper limit of the range for `i` is calculated as `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. If `num` remains the same, we need to ensure that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is at least 3 for the loop to continue executing. This will be true if `num` is greater than or equal to 9 (since `int(9 ** 0.5) + 1` equals 4).

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `num` must be at least 9.

State: **`num` is 9 or greater, `i` is 3**
