Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the function returns False. If `num` is 2, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return any value, indicating that `num` is prime. If `num` is greater than 2, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. After the loop, if `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function will return False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any `i`, the function does not return any value, implying that `num` is prime.**
