The value at index `j` of the list `is_prime` is assigned `False`. Since `j` is 4, the element at index 4 in the list `is_prime` is set to `False`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and the rest of the list `is_prime` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with the 5th element (index 4) set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with the 5th element (index 4) set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
