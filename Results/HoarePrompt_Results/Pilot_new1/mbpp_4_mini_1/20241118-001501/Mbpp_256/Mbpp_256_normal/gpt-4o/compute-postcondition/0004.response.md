The values of `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `False`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, the list `is_prime` has at least two elements. The previous values of `is_prime` were all `True`, but after this assignment, the values at the first two indices change to `False`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and all other elements remain `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and all other elements are `True`.**
