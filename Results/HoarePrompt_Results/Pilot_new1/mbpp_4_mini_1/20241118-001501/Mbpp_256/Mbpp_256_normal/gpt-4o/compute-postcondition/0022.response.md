The code sets `is_prime[j]` to `False`. The variable `j` is defined as `i * i + 2 * i`, where `i` is an integer such that `i * i < n`. This means that `j` is calculated based on the value of `i`. The value of `is_prime[j]` is being modified, indicating that the number represented by `j` is not prime. The other variables `n`, `is_prime`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `is_prime`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` has `is_prime[j]` set to `False`, `i` is an integer such that `i * i < n`, `j` is `i * i + 2 * i**
