According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is defined to start at `i * i` and continue until `n`, incrementing by `i`. 

Given that `i` is 2, the starting point for `j` will be `2 * 2 = 4`. For the loop to execute, the starting value of `j` (which is 4) must be less than `n`. Since it is stated that `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 4. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 4, and `j` should start at 4. The values of `i` and `is_prime` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
