Output State: **`is_prime` is a list of length `n` where all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n` are marked as `False`, `i` is 2, and `j` is the current multiple of `i` being marked. If `n` is less than `i * i` (which is 4 in this case), the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for those indices. If `n` is exactly equal to `i * i`, the loop will execute 0 times, and `is_prime` will remain unchanged for those indices.**
