The variable `is_prime` is assigned a list of boolean values, all set to `True`, with a length of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, the list will have a length of `n`, and all elements will be `True`. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, and `is_prime` is a list of `True` values of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, and `is_prime` is a list of `True` values of length `n`**
