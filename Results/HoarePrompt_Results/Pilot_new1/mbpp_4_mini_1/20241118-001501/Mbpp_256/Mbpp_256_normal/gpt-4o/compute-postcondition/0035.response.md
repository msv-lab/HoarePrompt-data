Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`. If `is_prime[i]` is True, all indices in `is_prime` that are multiples of `3` from `9` to `n-1` are set to False. Specifically, for `n` equal to 9, `is_prime[9]` is set to False; for `n` equal to 10, `is_prime[9]` is set to False; for `n` equal to 11, `is_prime[9]` is set to False; for `n` equal to 12, both `is_prime[9]` and `is_prime[12]` are set to False; for `n` equal to 13, both `is_prime[9]` and `is_prime[12]` are set to False; for `n` equal to 14, both `is_prime[9]` and `is_prime[12]` are set to False; for `n` equal to 15, `is_prime[9]`, `is_prime[12]`, and `is_prime[15]` are set to False; for `n` equal to 16, `is_prime[9]`, `is_prime[12]`, and `is_prime[15]` are set to False; for `n` equal to 17, `is_prime[9]`, `is_prime[12]`, and `is_prime[15]` are set to False; for `n` equal to 18, `is_prime[9]`, `is_prime[12]`, `is_prime[15]`, and `is_prime[18]` are set to False. If `is_prime[i]` is False, the list `is_prime` remains unchanged.***
