Output State: **`is_prime` is a list of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and for all indices `i` where `i` is a prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n` are set to `False`. If `n` is less than 4, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is exactly 4, the loop executes 0 times, and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the loop will execute at least once if there are primes less than or equal to the square root of `n`. If `i * i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the inner loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for those indices.**
