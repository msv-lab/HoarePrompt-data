According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 15
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 15

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to calculate the next value of `j` based on the current value of `j`. The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `15 + 3 = 18`. 

Since `n` is greater than 15, we must ensure that `n` is also greater than 18 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 18.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 18; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[9]` set to `False`, `is_prime[12]` set to `False`, and `is_prime[15]` is now set to `False`; `i` is 3; `j` is 18**
