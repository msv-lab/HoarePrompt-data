According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `2` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `9`. 

To determine the next state:
1. The maximum value for `i` in the current iteration is `int(n ** 0.5)`. 
2. For `n = 9`, `i` would be `3`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `4`.
3. For `n = 10`, `i` would also be `3`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `4`.
4. For `n = 11`, `i` would be `3`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `4`.
5. For `n = 12`, `i` would be `3`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `4`.
6. For `n = 13`, `i` would be `3`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `4`.
7. For `n = 14`, `i` would be `3`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `4`.
8. For `n = 15`, `i` would be `3`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `4`.
9. For `n = 16`, `i` would be `3`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `4`.
10. For `n = 17`, `i` would be `4`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `5`.
11. For `n = 18`, `i` would be `4`, and the next iteration would not occur since `i` would reach `5`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)` which means `n` must be increased to at least `19` (since `int(19 ** 0.5) + 1` equals `5`).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 19, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is 4**
