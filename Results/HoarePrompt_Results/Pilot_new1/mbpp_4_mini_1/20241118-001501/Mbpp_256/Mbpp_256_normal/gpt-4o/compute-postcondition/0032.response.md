The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`, and since `j` is 15, this means `is_prime[15]` is now `False`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 15; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[9]` set to `False`, `is_prime[12]` set to `False`, and `is_prime[15]` is now set to `False`; `i` is 3; `j` is 15.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 15; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[9]` set to `False`, `is_prime[12]` set to `False`, and `is_prime[15]` is now set to `False`; `i` is 3; `j` is 15**
