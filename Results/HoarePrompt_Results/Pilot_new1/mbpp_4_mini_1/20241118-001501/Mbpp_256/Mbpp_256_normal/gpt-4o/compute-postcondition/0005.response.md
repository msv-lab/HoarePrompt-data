According to the code, the for loop will execute if the starting value of `i` is less than or equal to the ending value defined by `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `int(n ** 0.5)` will be at least 1, which means the loop will start at 2 and can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 4 (since the square root of 4 is 2).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that the condition for `i` is satisfied. The starting value of `i` is 2, and the loop will run until `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `i` should start at 2.
- `n` should be at least 4 (to ensure that `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` is at least 3).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and all other elements are `True`, `i` is 2**
