Output State: **`is_prime` is a list of length `n` where all indices from `9` to `n-1` that are multiples of `3` are set to `False`. If `n` is less than `9`, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is exactly `9`, the loop executes only once, setting `is_prime[9]` to `False`. If `n` is `10`, the loop executes once, and `is_prime[9]` is set to `False`. If `n` is `11`, the loop executes once, and `is_prime[9]` is set to `False`. If `n` is `12`, the loop executes twice, setting `is_prime[9]` and `is_prime[12]` to `False`. If `n` is `13`, the loop executes twice, setting `is_prime[9]` and `is_prime[12]` to `False`. If `n` is `14`, the loop executes twice, setting `is_prime[9]` and `is_prime[12]` to `False`. If `n` is `15`, the loop executes three times, setting `is_prime[9]`, `is_prime[12]`, and `is_prime[15]` to `False`. If `n` is `16`, the loop executes three times, setting `is_prime[9]`, `is_prime[12]`, and `is_prime[15]` to `False`. If `n` is `17`, the loop executes three times, setting `is_prime[9]`, `is_prime[12]`, and `is_prime[15]` to `False`. If `n` is `18`, the loop executes four times, setting `is_prime[9]`, `is_prime[12]`, `is_prime[15]`, and `is_prime[18]` to `False`.**
