According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop is set to iterate over the range starting from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `n` is greater than 4. The starting point for the next iteration will be `j + i`, which is `4 + 2 = 6`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

Since `n` is greater than 4, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 6 for the loop to run one more time. Therefore, we can adjust `n` to be greater than 6.

Also, after the last iteration, `j` is currently 4, and it will be updated to 6 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with the 5th element (index 4) set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
