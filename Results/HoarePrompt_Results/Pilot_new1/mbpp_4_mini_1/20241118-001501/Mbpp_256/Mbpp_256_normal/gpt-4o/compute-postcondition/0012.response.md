The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned `False`, and since `j` is 8, this means that `is_prime[8]` is set to `False`. However, it is already stated in the initial state that `is_prime[8]` is set to `False`. Therefore, the state of `is_prime` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 8, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with the 5th element (index 4) set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 8, and `is_prime[8]` is set to `False`**
