According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 6, and `n` is greater than 6. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value calculated by `j = j + i`, which will be `j = 6 + 2 = 8`. Since `n` is greater than 6, it must also be ensured that `n` is greater than 8 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 8, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with the 5th element (index 4) set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 8, and `is_prime[8]` is set to `False`**
