The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`, where `j` is 12. Since `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[9]` set to `False`, the value of `is_prime[12]` is now also set to `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `is_prime[9]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 12; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[9]` set to `False`, `is_prime[12]` is set to `False`; `i` is 3; `j` is 12.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 12; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[9]` set to `False`, `is_prime[12]` is set to `False`; `i` is 3; `j` is 12**
