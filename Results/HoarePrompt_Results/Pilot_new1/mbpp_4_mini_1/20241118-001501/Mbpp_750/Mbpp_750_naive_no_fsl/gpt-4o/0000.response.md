Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the end of the list by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it. 

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works as expected for the given test cases:
1. `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` correctly returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
2. `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` correctly returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
3. `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` correctly returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

Additionally, the function should handle edge cases such as:
- An empty list and a non-empty tuple: `func_1([], (1, 2))` would return `[1, 2]`.
- A non-empty list and an empty tuple: `func_1([1, 2], ())` would return `[1, 2]`.
- Both an empty list and an empty tuple: `func_1([], ())` would return `[]`.

Since the function behaves correctly for all these potential cases and adheres to the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
