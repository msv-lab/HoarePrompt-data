Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst, tup)` correctly adds the elements of the given tuple `tup` to the end of the given list `lst`. It converts the tuple to a list using `list(tup)` and then concatenates it with `lst` using the `+` operator. This implementation handles all potential cases, including:

1. An empty list and a non-empty tuple.
2. A non-empty list and an empty tuple.
3. Both the list and the tuple being empty.

In all of these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description, thus confirming its correctness.
