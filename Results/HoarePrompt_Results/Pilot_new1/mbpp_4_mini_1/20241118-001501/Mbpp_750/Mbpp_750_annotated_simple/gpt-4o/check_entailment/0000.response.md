Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`) as arguments and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the elements of the tuple converted to a list. 

The logic of the code is sound:
- It uses `list(tpl)` to convert the tuple to a list.
- It then concatenates this list to the original list using the `+` operator.

This will work for any tuple and list provided as input, including edge cases such as:
- An empty list and an empty tuple.
- A non-empty list and an empty tuple.
- An empty list and a non-empty tuple.
- Both the list and the tuple being non-empty.

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
