Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and it concatenates them by converting the tuple into a list. The annotations confirm that the function handles cases where either `lst` or `tup` can be empty, returning the appropriate concatenated result without errors.

To further analyze:

1. **Functionality**: The function uses the expression `lst + list(tup)` which correctly concatenates the list and the converted tuple. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Edge Cases**: The annotations explicitly mention that the function handles cases where `lst` can be empty or `tup` can be empty. For example:
   - If `lst` is empty (`[]`) and `tup` is non-empty (`(1, 2)`), the result will be `[1, 2]`.
   - If `lst` is non-empty (`[3]`) and `tup` is empty (`()`), the result will be `[3]`.
   - If both are empty (`[]` and `()`), the result will be `[]`.

3. **Correctness in All Cases**: The code adheres to the problem description in every potential case, as confirmed by the examples provided in the annotations. There are no edge cases that the code fails to handle.

Since there are no identified cases where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description and the annotations, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Thus, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
