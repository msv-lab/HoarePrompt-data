The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `n` if it is less than 2, returns `n` if it is 2 or 3, returns 4 if `n` is equal to 4, and returns 0 for any non-negative integer `n` greater than 4. The function does not handle negative integers or any input type other than non-negative integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
