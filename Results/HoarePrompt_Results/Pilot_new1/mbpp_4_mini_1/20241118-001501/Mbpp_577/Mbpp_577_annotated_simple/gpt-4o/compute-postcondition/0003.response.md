The variable `factorial` is initialized to 1. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and less than 5, its value does not affect the initialization of `factorial`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer and less than 5, `factorial` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and less than 5, `factorial` is 1**
