To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the given code and its annotations in relation to the problem description, which is to find the last digit in the factorial of a given number.

Here is the code again for reference:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return n
    else :
        if (n == 2 or n == 3) :
            return n
        else :
            if (n == 4) :
                return 4
            else :
                return 0
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Case when n < 2:**
   - The function returns `n`, which is correct as the factorial of 0 is 1 (last digit 1), and the factorial of 1 is also 1 (last digit 1).

2. **Case when n == 2 or n == 3:**
   - The function returns `n`, which is correct:
     - `2! = 2` (last digit 2)
     - `3! = 6` (last digit 6)

3. **Case when n == 4:**
   - The function returns `4`, which is incorrect because:
     - `4! = 24` (last digit 4)
   - This part of the code is correct, but it does not account for the last digit of the factorial correctly.

4. **Case when n > 4:**
   - The function returns `0` for all `n > 4`. This is incorrect because:
     - For `n = 5`, `5! = 120` (last digit 0)
     - For `n = 6`, `6! = 720` (last digit 0)
     - For `n = 7`, `7! = 5040` (last digit 0)
     - For `n = 8`, `8! = 40320` (last digit 0)
     - For `n = 9`, `9! = 362880` (last digit 0)
     - For `n = 10`, `10! = 3628800` (last digit 0)
   - The last digit of the factorial for any `n >= 5` is always `0`, but the function incorrectly returns `0` without any specific logic.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly compute the last digit of the factorial for all potential cases, particularly for those greater than 4. It fails to provide the correct last digit for `n = 5` and beyond, as it simply returns `0` without considering the actual last digit of the factorial.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
