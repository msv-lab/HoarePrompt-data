You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number.
Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return n
        #The program returns the non-negative integer n, which is less than 2
    else :
        if (n == 2 or n == 3) :
            return n
            #The program returns either 2 or 3
        else :
            if (n == 4) :
                return 4
                #The program returns 4
            else :
                return 0
                #The program returns 0
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and not equal to 2 or 3. If `n` is equal to 4, the function returns 4; otherwise, it returns 0. This means the function will return 0 for all values of `n` that are greater than 4 or any non-negative integer less than 4 that is not equal to 2 or 3.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is equal to 2 or 3, the function returns `n`. If `n` is equal to 4, the function returns 4. For all other values of `n` that are greater than 4 or any non-negative integers less than 4 that are not equal to 2 or 3, the function returns 0.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `n`. If `n` is equal to 2 or 3, the function returns `n`. If `n` is equal to 4, the function returns 4. For all other non-negative integers greater than 4 or those less than 4 that are not equal to 2 or 3, the function returns 0.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
