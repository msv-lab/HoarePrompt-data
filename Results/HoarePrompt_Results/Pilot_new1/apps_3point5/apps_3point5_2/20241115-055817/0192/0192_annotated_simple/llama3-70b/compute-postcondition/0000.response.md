Example Answer:
The values of x and y are assigned by splitting the input values. As per the precondition, x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, after the execution, x and y will hold the input values as integers satisfying the given condition.
Output State: **x and y are integers satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
