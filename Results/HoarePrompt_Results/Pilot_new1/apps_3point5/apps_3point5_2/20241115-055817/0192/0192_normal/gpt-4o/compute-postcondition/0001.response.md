Example Answer:
The code calculates the difference between x and y, then divides it by 2 and adds the remainder of the division by 2. Since x and y are integers satisfying the precondition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result will always be an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y remain unchanged.
Output State: **x and y remain unchanged**
