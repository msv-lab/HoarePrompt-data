Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads two integers x and y from the user input.
- It then calculates the result of (x - y) divided by 2 plus the remainder of (x - y) divided by 2.
- The provided examples in the problem description are valid and the code gives the correct output for those examples.
- The code handles the case where x and y are within the specified range (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000).
- There are no edge cases identified where the code fails to meet the problem description requirements.
