Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes two very long integers as input, removes any leading zeroes, and then compares them. It correctly prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>', if the first number is greater than the second, and '=' if the numbers are equal. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and works as expected.
