Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing leading zeros. If `a` was originally an empty string, `b` remains an empty string. The length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. After the execution of the if-else block, `b` is guaranteed to be '0'.***
