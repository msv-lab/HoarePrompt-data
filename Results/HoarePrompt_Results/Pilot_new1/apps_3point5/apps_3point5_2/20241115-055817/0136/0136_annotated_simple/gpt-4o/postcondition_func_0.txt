The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them. It then prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b`, or '=', if they are equal. If `a` or `b` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. The comparison is based on the lengths of the integers and their actual values. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it performs the comparison and printing operations based on the input integers `a` and `b`.
