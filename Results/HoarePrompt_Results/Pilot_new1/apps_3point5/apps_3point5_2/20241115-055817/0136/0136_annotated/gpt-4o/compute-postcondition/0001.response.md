Example Answer:
The string `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed. The value of `data[0]` is unknown, so the output state is: `data` is a list containing two elements, where `data[0]` represents the string `a` with leading zeros removed and `data[1]` represents the string `b`.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing two elements, where `data[0]` represents the string `a` with leading zeros removed and `data[1]` represents the string `b`**
