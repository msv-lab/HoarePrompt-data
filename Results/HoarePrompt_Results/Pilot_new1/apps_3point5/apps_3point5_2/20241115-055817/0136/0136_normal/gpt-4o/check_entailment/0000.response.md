Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` represented as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares their values. It then prints the appropriate symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison result. The code correctly handles cases where `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to `b`. It also correctly assigns '0' to the variables `a` or `b` if they are empty strings. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, and the output hints align with the code's functionality. Therefore, the code is correct.
