Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is assigned the input with leading zeros removed. Since `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, the input is directly assigned to `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros**
