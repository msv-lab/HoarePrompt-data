Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in two positive integers `n` and `k` as input.
- It then checks if `n` is less than `k`, if so, it prints -1 as the answer does not exist.
- Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `seq` to store the sequence of numbers.
- It then iterates from 1 to `k+1` and appends the numbers to `seq` such that the sum of the numbers is equal to `n`.
- If the length of the sequence is not equal to `k`, it prints -1.
- Otherwise, it prints the sequence of numbers.
- The code seems to follow the problem description as it generates a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers with a sum equal to `n`.
- The output hints also mention the function `func_1` which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, but this function is not used in the main part of the code.
