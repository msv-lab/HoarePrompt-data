According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` evaluates to true, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` have been swapped. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to evaluate to true after the swap. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a and b have been swapped, b evaluates to true**
