According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` remains unchanged, `sequence` list is modified by incrementing the value at index `i` if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks, and `i` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` remains unchanged, `sequence` list is modified by incrementing the value at index `i` if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0**
