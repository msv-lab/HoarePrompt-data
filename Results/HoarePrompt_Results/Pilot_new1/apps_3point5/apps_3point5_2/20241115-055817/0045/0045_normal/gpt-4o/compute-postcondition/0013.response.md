According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` remains unchanged, `sequence` list is modified by incrementing the value at index `i`, if `remainder` is equal to 0, then the program breaks. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` remains unchanged, `sequence` list is modified by incrementing the value at index `i`, if `remainder` is equal to 0, then the program breaks, `i` is greater than or equal to 1**
