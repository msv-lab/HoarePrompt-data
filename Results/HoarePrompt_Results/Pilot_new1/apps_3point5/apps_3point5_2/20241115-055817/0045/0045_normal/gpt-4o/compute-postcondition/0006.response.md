Example Answer:
A list `sequence` is created by iterating over a range of `k` values and multiplying each value by `d * (i + 1)`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the state of variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum`, and a new list `sequence` is created based on the formula provided.
Output State: **No change in the state of variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum`, and a new list `sequence` is created based on the formula provided**
