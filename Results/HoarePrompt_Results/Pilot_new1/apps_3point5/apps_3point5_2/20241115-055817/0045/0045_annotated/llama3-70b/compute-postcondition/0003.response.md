According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `b` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the previous value of `b` and `b` is the remainder when the previous value of `a` is divided by the previous value of `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` should not be equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the remainder when the previous value of `a` is divided by the previous value of `b`**
