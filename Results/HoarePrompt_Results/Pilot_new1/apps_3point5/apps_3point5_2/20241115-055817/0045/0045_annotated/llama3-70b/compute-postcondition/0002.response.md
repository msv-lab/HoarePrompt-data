Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are updated where `a` is assigned the previous value of `b` and `b` is assigned the remainder when the previous value of `a` is divided by the previous value of `b`. Since `a` was the previous value of `b`, and `b` was the remainder when the previous value of `a` was divided by the previous value of `b`, the new values of `a` and `b` are the same as the previous values of `b` and the remainder when the previous value of `a` is divided by the previous value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the remainder when the previous value of `a` is divided by the previous value of `b`.
Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the remainder when the previous value of `a` is divided by the previous value of `b`**
