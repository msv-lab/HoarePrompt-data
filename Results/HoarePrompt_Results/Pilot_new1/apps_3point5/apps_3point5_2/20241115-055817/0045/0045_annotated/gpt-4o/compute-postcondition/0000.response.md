Example Answer:
`min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is a positive integer, the value of `min_sum` will be calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`**
