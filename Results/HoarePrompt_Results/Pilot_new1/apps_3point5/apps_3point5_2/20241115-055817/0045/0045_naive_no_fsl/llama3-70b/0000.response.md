Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an input of two integers n and k, representing the total sum and the length of the sequence to be generated. It then generates a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers whose sum is equal to n and checks for the greatest common divisor. If the answer exists, it outputs the resulting sequence, otherwise -1.

The program logic seems correct as it iterates over numbers from 1 to k, adding them to the sequence while decrementing n until the required sequence length is achieved. If n is less than k, it outputs -1. The program handles the cases where there is no possible sequence by outputting -1. The program also outputs any valid sequence if there are multiple answers, which is acceptable as per the problem description. Overall, the program appears to correctly solve the given problem.
