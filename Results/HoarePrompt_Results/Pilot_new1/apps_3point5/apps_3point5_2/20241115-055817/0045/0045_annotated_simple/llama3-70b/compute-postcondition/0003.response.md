According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are positive integers with updated values after the operation. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `b` needs to be adjusted to a positive integer that is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers with updated values after the operation, where `b` is a positive integer greater than 0**
