Postcondition: ***If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `k` is at least 2. If `remainder` becomes 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. After executing the if block, if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. All initial conditions are preserved, and the program handles all possible edge cases related to the values of the variables involved.***
