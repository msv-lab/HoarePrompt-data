Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, but it is known that `b` is a positive integer greater than 0. After execution, the new values of `a` and `b` are updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers with updated values after the operation, where `b` is a positive integer greater than 0**
