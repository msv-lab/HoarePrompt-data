Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `i` is the next iteration value. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of shares and b[i], and shares is reset to 0. Otherwise, if shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
