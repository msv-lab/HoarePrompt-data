Example Answer:
`total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. The values of `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles` are dependent on the input list `b` and `r`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive. `b` is a list of integers created from the input values. `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. The maximum selling price is greater than the minimum buying price. `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by the minimum buying price in the list `b`. `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by the minimum buying price in the list `b`. `total_bourles` is the calculated total amount of bourles.
