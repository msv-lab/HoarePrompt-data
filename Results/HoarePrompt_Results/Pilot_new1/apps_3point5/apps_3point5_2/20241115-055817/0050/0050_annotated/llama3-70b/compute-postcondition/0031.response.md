Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is valid, `m` is greater than 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, then `n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is valid, `m` is greater than 0, `shares` will be updated based on loop execution, `i` is the final iteration value, and the loop or if statement is exited by the break statement.***
