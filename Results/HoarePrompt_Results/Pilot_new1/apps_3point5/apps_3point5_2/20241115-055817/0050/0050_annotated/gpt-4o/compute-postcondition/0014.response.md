Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from input, along with two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buy price, calculates the remaining bourles after buying those shares, and then calculates the total bourles by selling the maximum shares at the maximum sell price and adding the remaining bourles. The function prints the total bourles. The function does not accept any parameters. The functionality covers scenarios where the lists `s` and `b` are empty or have different lengths, as well as the cases where the minimum buy price is equal to the maximum sell price.**
