Functionality: ** The function takes three integer inputs, calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price from two lists, and then determines the total earnings based on certain conditions. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the initial investment `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining funds after buying those shares, and the total earnings from selling those shares, then prints the total earnings. The function handles positive integer inputs within specific ranges and provides the expected output accordingly.**
