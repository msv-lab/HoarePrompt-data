Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by taking the modulo of `r` and `s[i]`, where `i` is an index. The value of `r` and `s[i]` is known, so the new value of `r` is the remainder of the division of the current value of `r` by the value of `s[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` is updated based on the calculation, `s`, `b` remain the same, `shares` is updated.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` is updated based on the calculation, `s`, `b` remain the same, `shares` is updated**
