Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares`, `remaining_bourles`, `total_bourles` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 30 and 1 <= `r` <= 1000. `s_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000. `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the program prints `r`. Otherwise, the program calculates `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, then prints `total_bourles`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
