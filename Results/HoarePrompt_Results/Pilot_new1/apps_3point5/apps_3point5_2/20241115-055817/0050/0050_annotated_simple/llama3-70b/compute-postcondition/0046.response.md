Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, sorts two lists `s` and `b`, calculates the number of shares based on the division of `r` by elements of `s`, and then updates `r` based on the calculated shares and values from list `b`. The final value of `r` is printed at the end. The function does not have a return value specified.**
