Postcondition: ***`n` and `m+1` are integers greater than 0, `r` is a positive integer within the specified range, `s` is a list with elements, `b` is a list containing the mapped input values sorted in reverse order, `i` is incremented by 1. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop.***
