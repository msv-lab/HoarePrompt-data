Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in reverse order. The values in the list are rearranged in descending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, and `b` is a list containing the mapped input values sorted in reverse order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, and `b` is a list containing the mapped input values sorted in reverse order**
