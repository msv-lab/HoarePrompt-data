Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It uses the formula for calculating the probability and handles large numbers by taking the remainder modulo 10^6 + 3. The gcd function is used to ensure that A and B are coprime. The program also handles the edge case where k is greater than 2^n, in which case it prints 1 1 as the output. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
