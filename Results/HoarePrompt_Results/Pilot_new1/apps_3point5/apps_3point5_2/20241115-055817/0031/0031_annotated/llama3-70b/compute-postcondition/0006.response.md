According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is calculated as 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator` multiplied by `total_days - i`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, and `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is calculated as 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator` multiplied by `total_days - i`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`**
