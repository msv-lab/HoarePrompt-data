Example Answer:
The code `print(1, 1)` simply prints the values 1 and 1. It does not affect the initial state variables `MOD` and `k`. Therefore, the output state is MOD is assigned the value 1000003, k is an integer greater than 1 shifted left by n.
Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003, k is an integer greater than 1 shifted left by n**
