Output State: **If k is greater than 0, then after the gcd calculation, `numerator` is the product of (total_days - i) for i from 0 to k-1, `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by `total_days` to the power of k, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `k` is greater than 0, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. If k is 0 or negative, then after the gcd calculation, `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains 2 to the power of `n`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of 1 and 2 to the power of `n`.**
