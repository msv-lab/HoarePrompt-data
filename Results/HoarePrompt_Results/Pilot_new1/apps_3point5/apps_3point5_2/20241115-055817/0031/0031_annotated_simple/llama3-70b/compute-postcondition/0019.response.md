Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the numerator and denominator based on the input values of `n` and `k`. Then, it finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator, updates both values accordingly, and finally returns the remainder of the updated numerator divided by (10^6 + 3) and the remainder of the updated denominator divided by (10^6 + 3). **
