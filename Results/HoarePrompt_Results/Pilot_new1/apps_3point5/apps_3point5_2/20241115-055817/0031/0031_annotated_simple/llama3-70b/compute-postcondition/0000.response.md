Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer. The value of `n` can range from 1 to 10^18, so the value of `total_days` will be 2 to the power of that `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`**
