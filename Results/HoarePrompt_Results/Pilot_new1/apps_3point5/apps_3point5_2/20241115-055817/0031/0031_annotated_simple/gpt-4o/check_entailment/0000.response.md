Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland based on the input values of n and k. The program uses two functions to calculate the greatest common divisor and perform the necessary calculations. It handles the edge case where k is greater than 1 shifted left by n by directly outputting 1 and 1. For all other cases, the program calculates the probability correctly and prints the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3, which are coprime. The program logic aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples.
