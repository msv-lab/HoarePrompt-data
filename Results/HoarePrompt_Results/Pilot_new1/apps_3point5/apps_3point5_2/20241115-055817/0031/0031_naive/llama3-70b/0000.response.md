Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland as described in the problem statement. It uses the formula for calculating the probability and then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form. The program also handles large numbers by taking the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3. The logic seems to be correct and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
