Example Answer: 
`denominator` is updated to be the floor division result of `denominator` divided by `gcd`, and `total_days` remains the same. The previous value of `denominator` is divided by `gcd`, so after execution, `denominator` is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is updated to be the floor division result of `numerator` divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is updated, `total_days` remains the same.
Output State: **`numerator` is updated to be the floor division result of `numerator` divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is updated, `total_days` remains the same**
