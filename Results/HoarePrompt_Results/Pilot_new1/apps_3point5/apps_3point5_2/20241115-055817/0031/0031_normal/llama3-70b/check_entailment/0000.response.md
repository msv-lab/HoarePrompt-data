Correctness: **False**

The code does not accurately calculate the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. The function `func_1` calculates the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` instead of the remainder of `n` divided by `k`, which is not consistent with the problem description.

Additionally, the output hints do not align with the actual code functionality, as they describe a different calculation than what the code is performing. This discrepancy further confirms that the code is incorrect.
