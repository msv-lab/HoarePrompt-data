According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numerator` is updated based on the formula `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0 and needs to be less than `k` for the loop to execute again, `i` should be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`numerator` is updated based on the formula `numerator * (total_days - 1) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
