Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. `c` is equal to 0. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the program prints 'YES'. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then the program prints 'NO'. This covers all possible cases of the program execution based on the values of `a` and `b`, ensuring the postcondition accurately represents the outcomes.***
