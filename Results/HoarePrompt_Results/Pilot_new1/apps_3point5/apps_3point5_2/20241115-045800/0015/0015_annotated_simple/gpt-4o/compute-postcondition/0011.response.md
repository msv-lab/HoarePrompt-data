Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. `b` is not equal to `a`. `c` is not equal to 0. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied, then 'YES' is printed. If the condition is not met, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all cases where `b` and `a` are different, `c` is not 0, and the division between `b` and `a` by `c` results in a non-negative integer or the remainder of the division is 0.***
