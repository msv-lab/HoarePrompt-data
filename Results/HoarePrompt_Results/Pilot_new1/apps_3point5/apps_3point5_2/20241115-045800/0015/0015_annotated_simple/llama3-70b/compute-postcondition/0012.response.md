Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, then 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. The result of (b - a) / c is an integer and non-negative in the true case, otherwise, the condition is false.***
