Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If the difference between neighboring elements is 0 (c=0), then the sequence is just a repeated number. If the first element (a) is equal to Vasya's favorite number (b), then 'YES' is printed, indicating that b appears in the sequence. If a is not equal to b, then 'NO' is printed, correctly indicating that b does not appear in the sequence.
2. If the difference between neighboring elements is not 0, then the sequence is an arithmetic progression. If (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then 'YES' is printed, correctly indicating that b appears in the sequence. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, indicating that b does not appear in the sequence.
