Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input split. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) holds true, indicating that the division of (b - a) by c results in an integer and the result is non-negative. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correct handling of input values and conditions.***
