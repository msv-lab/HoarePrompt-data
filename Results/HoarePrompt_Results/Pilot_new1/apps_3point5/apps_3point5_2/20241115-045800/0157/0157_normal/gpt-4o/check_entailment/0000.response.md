Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes in three inputs representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the minimum of the ratios of each fruit to lemons. It multiplies this maximum number of lemons by the corresponding ratios for apples and pears to get the total number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote. Finally, it prints this total number of fruits as output.

The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It ensures that the compote is made in the ratio 1:2:4 by calculating the maximum number of each fruit that can be used based on the minimum ratio to lemons. The output is the sum of the maximum number of each fruit that can be used, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description and the provided examples.
