Example Answer:
The variable `target_len` is assigned the length of the string `target`. The length of `target` is unknown, but it falls within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of `target`.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of `target`**
