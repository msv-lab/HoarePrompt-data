Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the `res` string. The `res` string now contains the first character of the `alphabet` string followed by the updated number of occurrences of `char` in the loop. The `alphabet` and `s` variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` with updated occurrence of `char`, `alphabet` remains unchanged, `res` contains the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by the updated number of occurrences of `char` in the loop, `res` is updated to include the character `char`**
