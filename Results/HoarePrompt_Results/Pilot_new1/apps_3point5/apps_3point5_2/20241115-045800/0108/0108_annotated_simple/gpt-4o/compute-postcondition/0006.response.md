Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of `target`, `i` is 0, `j` is either 0 or 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.***
