Postcondition: ***If s contains any character from the alphabet, res will be a string consisting of the characters in the alphabet that are present in s, in the order they appear in the alphabet. The characters in res will be repeated based on the number of occurrences of each character in s. If s does not contain any character from the alphabet, res will be an empty string. Additionally, if the length of res is 26, the function prints res; otherwise, it prints -1. This covers all possible scenarios based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
