According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, and `res` contains the next character in the alphabet. To execute the loop one more time, the new `char` should be the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, `res` contains the next character in the alphabet, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`**
