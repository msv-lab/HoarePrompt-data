Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `target`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to `target_len`.
Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to `target_len`**
