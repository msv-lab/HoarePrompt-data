Example Answer:
The character 'char' in string 's' is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. The replacement is done only once. If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, then 'res' will contain the character 'a'. 
Output State: **If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' contains the character 'a'**
