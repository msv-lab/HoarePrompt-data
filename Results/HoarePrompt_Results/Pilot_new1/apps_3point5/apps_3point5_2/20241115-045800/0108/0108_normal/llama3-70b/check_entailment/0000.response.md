Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an input string `s` and iterates through the alphabet.
- It builds a new string `res` by replacing characters in `s` with the next character in the alphabet.
- If `s` contains all alphabet characters, it prints the alphabet in order.
- If not, it prints -1.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles the scenario where the input string can be transformed into the English alphabet as a subsequence. The logic of replacing characters with the next character in the alphabet until all characters are present ensures that the output will be the English alphabet in order. The condition to check if the length of the result is 26 also guarantees that all characters are present before printing the result.
