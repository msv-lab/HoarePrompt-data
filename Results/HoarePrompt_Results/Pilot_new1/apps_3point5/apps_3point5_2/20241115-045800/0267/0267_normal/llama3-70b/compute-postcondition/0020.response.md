Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store previously computed values. If (n, k) is already a key in dp, the program returns the corresponding value stored in dp. If n < 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is updated to n. If k is less than or equal to 1, the program returns 0. Otherwise, after the loop executes, dp[n, k] is updated according to the provided formula.***
