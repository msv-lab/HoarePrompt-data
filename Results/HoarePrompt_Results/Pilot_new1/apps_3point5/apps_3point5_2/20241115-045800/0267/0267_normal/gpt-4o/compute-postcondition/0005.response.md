According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. 
At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is the starting value, `r` is the ending value. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to the value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `num` needs to be updated to the next value after the current `num`.
- If `num` is currently equal to `r`, then `l` needs to be updated to the next value after the current `l`.

State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `num` is equal to the next value after the current `num`, `l` is the next value after the current `l`, `r` is the ending value**
