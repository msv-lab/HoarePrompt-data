The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The Precondition specifies that `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The program returns the updated value of 'total_sum' after executing the loop based on the conditions specified. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters l, r, and k. It updates the value of 'total_sum' after executing the loop based on the specified conditions.**
