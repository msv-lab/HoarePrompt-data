The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n (an integer) and k (a positive integer). It returns True if the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k, otherwise it returns False. However, the code does not handle cases where n is negative or k is 0, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
