Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulo of its current value with `MOD`. The loop executes only if `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, after the loop executes, `dp[n, k]` will be updated to the result of the modulo operation. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **No change in other variables; `dp[n, k]` is updated to the result of the modulo operation**
