According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `total_sum` needs to be updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`.
2. `num` needs to be updated to `l + 2`.
3. `l` needs to be updated to be less than or equal to `r`.
4. The result of `func_1(num, k)` must be true for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 2`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true**.
