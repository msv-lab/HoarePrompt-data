According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer and the loop starts from 1, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, dp is a dictionary where dp[n, k] is assigned the value 9**
