The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a non-negative integer, `k`, which is a positive integer, and `dp`, which is a dictionary to store computed values. 

Case 1: If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0. In all other cases, the initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Case 2: If (n, k) is already a key in `dp`, then the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.

Case 3: The function returns the value stored at key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` to store computed values. Depending on the cases mentioned above, the function either returns 0, the value stored at key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`, or the value stored at that key if it already exists.
