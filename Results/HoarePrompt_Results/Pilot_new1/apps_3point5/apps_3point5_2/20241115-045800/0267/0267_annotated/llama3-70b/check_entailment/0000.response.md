Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `count`, that work together to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. The `func_1` function computes the result by subtracting the count of numbers less than `l` with at most `k` different digits from the count of numbers less than or equal to `r` with at most `k` different digits. The `count` function handles the actual counting based on the constraints provided in the problem description.

The `count` function correctly implements the logic to count the numbers within the specified range with at most `k` different digits. It considers various cases such as when `k` is 0, when `(n, k)` is already in the dictionary `dp`, and when `n` is less than `10**k`. The function also utilizes a loop to update the count based on a specific formula. The final result is returned after considering all edge cases and scenarios.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases specified in the problem statement. The annotations in the code provide insights into the implementation details and edge cases, which further support the correctness of the program.
