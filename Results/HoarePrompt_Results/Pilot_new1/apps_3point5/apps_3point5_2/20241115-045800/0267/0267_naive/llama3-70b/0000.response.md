Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. The function uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the sum.

The function `count` is used to calculate the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits in the range `[1, n]`. This count is then used to calculate the sum of numbers in the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of numbers satisfying the condition for all potential cases within the given constraints. Additionally, the modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure that the result is within the specified range. 

Therefore, based on the understanding of the problem description and the implementation provided, the program is correct for all potential cases.
