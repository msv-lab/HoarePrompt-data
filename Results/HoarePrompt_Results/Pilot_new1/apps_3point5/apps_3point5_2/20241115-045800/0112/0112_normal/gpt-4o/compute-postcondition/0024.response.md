Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if the digit is found on cube i and False otherwise. `found` is True if the digit is found on any cube face and False otherwise. If the digit is found on a cube face and that cube has not been used before, the corresponding boolean in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the digit is not found on any cube face, `found` remains False. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute and all variables remain unchanged. After the if statement executes, if `found` is False, the program returns False.***
