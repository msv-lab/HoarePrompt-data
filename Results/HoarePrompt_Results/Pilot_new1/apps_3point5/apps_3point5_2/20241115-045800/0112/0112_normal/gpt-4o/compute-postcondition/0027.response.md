According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If there are more digits left to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if the digit is found on cube i and False otherwise, `found` is False. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more digits left in the `digits` list.
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if the digit is found on cube i and False otherwise, `found` is False, there are more digits left in the `digits` list**
