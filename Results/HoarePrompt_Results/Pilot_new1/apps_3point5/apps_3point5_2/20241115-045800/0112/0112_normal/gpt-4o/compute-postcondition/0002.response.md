According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, the number of cubes `n` being between 1 and 3 ensures the loop can execute. The `used_cubes` list being initialized to False for each cube means that the loop can execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `digits` list must have at least 1 digit, `n` is between 1 and 3, and each element in the `used_cubes` list is False.
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of the digits of the positive integer `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans initialized to False**
