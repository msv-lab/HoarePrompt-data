According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions specified. If there exists an index `i` such that `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, if the condition was met, `used_cubes` will have the `i-th` element set to True, `found` will be True, and the loop will be terminated with `i` being the index where the condition was met. If no such index exists or `digits` is empty, the loop will not execute, `found` will remain False, and all variables will remain unchanged. After the if statement, if `found` is False, the program will return False.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **If the loop executes again, `used_cubes` will have the `i-th` element set to True, `found` will be True, and the loop will be terminated with `i` being the index where the condition was met.**
