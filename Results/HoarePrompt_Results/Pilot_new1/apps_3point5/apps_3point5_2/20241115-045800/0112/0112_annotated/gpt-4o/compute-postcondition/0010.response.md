According to the code, the loop terminates when a break statement is encountered. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` contains at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is `True`, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition for the loop to continue must be met, which means `i` should be less than `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is `True`, `i` is 1**
