Example Answer:
The `digits` set is updated with the string representation of each digit in the `cube` sublist. Since `cube` is the first sublist in the list `cubes`, and `cubes` contains at least 1 sublist, we can assume that `cube` is a valid sublist. If `cube` contains integers [1, 2, 3], then after execution, the `digits` set will contain {'1', '2', '3'}. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 1 sublist, `cube` is the first sublist in the list, `digits` set contains {'1', '2', '3'}.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 1 sublist, `cube` is the first sublist in the list, `digits` set contains {'1', '2', '3'}**
