According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 4 sublists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 3 sublists, `cube` is the third sublist in the list, `digits` set contains {'1', '2', '3', 'digit1', 'digit2', ...} updated with string representations of digits in the third sublist. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least 4 sublists, and the `cube` should be the fourth sublist in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of sublists containing integers obtained from input with at least 4 sublists, `cube` is the fourth sublist in the list, `digits` set contains {'1', '2', '3', 'digit1', 'digit2', ...} updated with string representations of digits in the fourth sublist**
