Example Answer: 
The variable `found` is initialized to `False`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `digits` contains at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`, and `found` is `False`.
Output State: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`, `found` is `False`**
