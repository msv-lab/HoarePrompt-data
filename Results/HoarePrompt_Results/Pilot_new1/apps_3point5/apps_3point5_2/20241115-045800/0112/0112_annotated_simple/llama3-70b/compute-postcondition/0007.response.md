According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least one more cube, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting with at least one more cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube and the string representations of the digits in the next cube in the cubes list are added to `digits`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must contain at least one more cube.
State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting with at least two cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube and the string representations of the digits in the next cube in the cubes list are added to `digits`**
