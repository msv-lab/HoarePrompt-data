According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If there are more cubes in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the cubes list. For the loop to execute one more time, the cubes list must contain at least one more cube. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `cubes` should have at least one more cube in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting with at least one more cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube, `cube` is the next cube in the cubes list**
