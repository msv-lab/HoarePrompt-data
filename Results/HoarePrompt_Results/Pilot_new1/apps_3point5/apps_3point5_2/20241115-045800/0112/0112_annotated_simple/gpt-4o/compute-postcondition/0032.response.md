The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num`, a positive integer `n` representing the number of cubes, and a list `cube_faces` containing n lists, each containing 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes. 

Case 1: If num is a positive integer and there are at least n cubes with faces represented in cube_faces, the function will iterate through each digit in the number num and check if it can be formed by any of the cubes' faces. If a digit cannot be formed by any cube, the function will return False. If all digits can be formed by at least one cube face, the function will complete without any changes to the initial state. If n is 0 or cube_faces is empty, the function will not execute.

Case 2: If the function completes without returning False, it will return True. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `num`, a positive integer `n` representing the number of cubes, and a list `cube_faces` containing n lists of 6 integers. It will check if the number num can be formed by the faces of the cubes, returning True if it can and False if it cannot.
