Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, then reads `n` lists of integers and combines all digits into a set named `digits`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. The function then calculates the maximum number that can be formed by sorting the digits in descending order and joins them. Finally, it prints this maximum number.**
