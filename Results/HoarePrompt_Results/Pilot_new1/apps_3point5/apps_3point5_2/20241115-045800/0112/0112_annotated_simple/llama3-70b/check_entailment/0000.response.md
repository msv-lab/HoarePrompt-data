Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input which consists of the number of cubes Masha has and the digits on each face of the cubes.
2. It then creates a set of all unique digits present on the cubes, excluding '0' if it exists.
3. The program then sorts the digits in descending order, joins them into a string, converts the string to an integer, and prints the result.
4. The logic of the program is to find the maximum number that can be formed using the digits on the cubes, ensuring that '6' and '9' are not interchangeable. This logic is correctly implemented and the program outputs the maximum number that can be formed.
