Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an integer `n` as input, followed by a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list and iterates through it to count the number of elements that are not twice the value of the previous element. The code increments `m` by 1 for each such element. If `n` is less than 2, `m` remains 1. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.

The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations. It handles all potential cases where the sequence of operations can be performed, by checking if each element in the sorted list is twice the value of the previous element. If not, it increments the number of variables required. The code also accounts for the condition where `n` is less than 2, setting `m` to 1 in that case.

Therefore, based on the code logic and the problem description, the code is correct and provides the expected output for all cases.
