Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is an integer representing the current iteration of the loop. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index `i-1`, then `m` is increased by 1 during each iteration of the loop. If the loop does not execute (i.e., n is less than 2), then `m` remains 1. The output will be the value of `m` if `m` is less than or equal to 23, otherwise -1.**
