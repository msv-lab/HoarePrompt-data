Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in the number of elements `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`.
- The function sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
- It then iterates through the elements of `a` and checks if the difference between the current element and any element in the set `assigned` is also present in the set. If not, it increments the counter `m`.
- The function returns the final value of `m` after the loop terminates.
- This logic aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the minimum number of variables `m` such that the variables can help perform the described sequence of operations.
- The code handles all potential cases and correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the operations as described.
