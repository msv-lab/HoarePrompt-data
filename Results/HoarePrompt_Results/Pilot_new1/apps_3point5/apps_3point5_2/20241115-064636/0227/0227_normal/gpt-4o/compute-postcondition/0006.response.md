According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `assigned` contains at least one element. In this case, the first element of list `a` is contained in `assigned`. Before the loop starts, `can_form` is False which does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `assigned` should contain the first element of list `a` and `x` should be equal to the first element of list `a`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the first element of list `a`**
