Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of list `a`. If `a[i] - x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
