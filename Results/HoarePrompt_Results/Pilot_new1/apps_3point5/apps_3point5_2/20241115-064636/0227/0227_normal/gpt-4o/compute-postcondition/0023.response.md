Postcondition: ***If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues without changing any variables. If the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains False. After the if-else block, if `can_form` was initially False, `m` is increased by 1.***
