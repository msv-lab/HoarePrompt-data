Postcondition: ***If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is not empty, the loop iterates through each element `x` in `assigned`. If there is no element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False.***
