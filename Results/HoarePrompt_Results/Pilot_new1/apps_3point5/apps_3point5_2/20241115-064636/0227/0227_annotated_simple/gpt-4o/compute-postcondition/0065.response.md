Postcondition: ***If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains False, and `m` is incremented by 1. If `assigned` is not empty, the loop iterates through each element `x` in `assigned`. If there exists `x` such that `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
