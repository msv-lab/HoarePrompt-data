Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first `n` elements of `a`, `x` iterates over the next element in `assigned`, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is updated to the next index in `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If there exists an element in `a` such that the difference between that element and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
