Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The size of the list `a` is determined by the number of integers entered as input. The values of the integers are positive and distinct. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers.
Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct positive integers**
