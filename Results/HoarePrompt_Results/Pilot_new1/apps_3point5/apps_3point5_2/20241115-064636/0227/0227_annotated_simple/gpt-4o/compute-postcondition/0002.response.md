Example Answer:
`assigned` is an empty set, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. After executing the code, the first element of `a` is added to the `assigned` set. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`**
