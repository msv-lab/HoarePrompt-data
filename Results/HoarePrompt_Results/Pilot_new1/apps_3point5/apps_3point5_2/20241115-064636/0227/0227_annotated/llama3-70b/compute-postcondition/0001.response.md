Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values entered as input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The list `a` will contain `n` distinct positive integers. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and the integers are distinct and positive, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers**
