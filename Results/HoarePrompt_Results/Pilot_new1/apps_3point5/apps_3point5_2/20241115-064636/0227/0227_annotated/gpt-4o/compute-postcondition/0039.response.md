Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first `m+3` elements of list `a`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned` + 1, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `m+3` is greater than 0. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
