Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 23, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is either 2 or 3. If the condition `a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2` is met, `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being either 2 or 3 after the execution of the if statement.***
