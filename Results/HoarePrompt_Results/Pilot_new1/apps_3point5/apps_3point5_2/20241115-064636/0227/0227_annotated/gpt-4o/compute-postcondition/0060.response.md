Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If there is a match in `assigned` for `a[i] - x`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains unchanged. The variables `n`, `assigned`, `i`, `m+3`, `m+4` maintain their initial conditions as described in the precondition.***
