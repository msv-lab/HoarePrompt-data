According to the code, the loop can execute if `assigned` is not empty. So, for the loop to execute, `assigned` should contain at least one element. Before the loop starts, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, so it already has at least one element. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False**
