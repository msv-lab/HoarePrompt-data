According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `assigned` list. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` may or may not have been changed, `n`, `assigned`, `i`, `m+3`, `m+4` maintain their initial conditions. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `assigned` list must have more elements.
State: **`can_form` may or may not have changed, `n`, `assigned` has more elements, `i`, `m+3`, `m+4` maintain their initial conditions**
