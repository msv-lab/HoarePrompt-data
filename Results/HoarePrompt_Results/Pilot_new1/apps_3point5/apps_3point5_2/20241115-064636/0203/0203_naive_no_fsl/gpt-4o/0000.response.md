Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It maintains two queues, one for each fraction, and simulates the voting process by popping the first element from each queue and adding it back to the end of the queue based on the comparison of their indices. This process continues until one of the queues becomes empty, and then the outcome of the vote is determined. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output.
