Example Answer:
`i` is appended to `d_queue`, which means `i` is added to the end of the queue `d_queue`. The initial state had `n` as a positive integer, `votes` as a string of length n with at least 2 characters, `i` as 2, and `v` as the third character of the `votes` string. After execution, `d_queue` will contain the value 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character of the `votes` string, `d_queue` contains the value 2**
