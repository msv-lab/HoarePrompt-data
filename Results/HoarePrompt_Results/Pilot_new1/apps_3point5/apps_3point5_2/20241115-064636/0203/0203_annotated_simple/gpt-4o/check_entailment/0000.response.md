Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input which consists of the number of employees and their corresponding fractions.
2. It then creates two queues, one for 'D' characters and one for 'R' characters, based on the input.
3. The program then simulates the voting process by popping the indices from the queues and updating them based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
4. Finally, it determines the outcome of the vote by checking which queue is not empty and prints the corresponding result.
5. The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all cases as described.
