Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of the `votes` string. If the first character of `votes` is 'D', `d_queue` contains the values from 0 to i appended to it, `r_queue` is empty, and `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` has i appended to it. If the first character of `votes` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains the values from 0 to i appended to it, `d_queue` is empty, and `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` has i appended to it.***
