Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to `r_queue`. Since `i` is 1, after execution, `r_queue` will contain [1]. The queues `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated accordingly based on the initial state.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is not empty with more elements, i is 1, v is the second character in the votes list, r_queue contains [1], and d_queue contains only 0**
