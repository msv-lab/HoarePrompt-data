Example Answer:
`r_index` is incremented by `n` and added to the `r_queue`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and the previous value of `r_index` is known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` list has been iterated, `d_queue` and `r_queue` contain indices, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`, `d_queue` or `r_queue` may have an additional element based on the conditions, `r_index` is incremented by `n` and added to the `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` list has been iterated, `d_queue` and `r_queue` contain indices, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`, `d_queue` or `r_queue` may have an additional element based on the conditions, `r_index` is incremented by `n` and added to the `r_queue`**
