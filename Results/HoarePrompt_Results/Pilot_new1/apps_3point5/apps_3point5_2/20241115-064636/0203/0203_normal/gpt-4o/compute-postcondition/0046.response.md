The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the predefined constraints. The function calculates the majority party based on the input string `votes`, where each character represents the fraction the corresponding employee belongs to ('D' for depublicans or 'R' for remocrats). The function then returns the majority party ('D' for depublicans or 'R' for remocrats) based on the votes of the employees.
