Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` list has been iterated, `d_queue` and `r_queue` contain indices. `d_index` has been incremented by `n` and added to their respective queues based on the conditions. After the execution of the if-else block, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, the updated value of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, the updated value of `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`. This ensures that the program maintains the correct state of the queues and indices after the execution of the if-else block, handling all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
