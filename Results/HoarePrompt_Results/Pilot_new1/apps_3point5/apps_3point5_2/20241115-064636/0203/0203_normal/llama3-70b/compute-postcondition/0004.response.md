According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the fractions list must have at least 1 element, and the loop variable `fraction` should represent the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list with at least 1 element, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first element in the fractions list**
