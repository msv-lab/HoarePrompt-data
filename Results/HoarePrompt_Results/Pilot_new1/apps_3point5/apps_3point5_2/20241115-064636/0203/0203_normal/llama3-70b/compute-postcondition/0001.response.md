Example Answer: 
`fractions` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, but it is not directly affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is the input value.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is the input value**
