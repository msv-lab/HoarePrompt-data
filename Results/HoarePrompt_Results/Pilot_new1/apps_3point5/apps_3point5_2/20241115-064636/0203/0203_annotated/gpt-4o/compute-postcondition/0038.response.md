Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are queues. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` potentially has one more element where the value is `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` has one less element. `d_index` holds the previous value popped from `d_queue`, and `r_index` holds the previous popped value from `r_queue`. If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is potentially empty, `r_queue` has one more element where the value is `r_index + n`. `d_index` holds the value popped from `d_queue`, and `r_index` holds the popped value from `r_queue`.***
