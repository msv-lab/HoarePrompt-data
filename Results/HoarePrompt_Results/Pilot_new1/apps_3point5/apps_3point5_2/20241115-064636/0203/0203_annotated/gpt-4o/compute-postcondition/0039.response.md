According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the states of `d_queue` and `r_queue`. If both queues have elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions described are as follows:

- If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` potentially has one more element where the value is `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` has one less element.
- If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is potentially empty, `r_queue` has one more element where the value is `r_index + n`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the queues must still have elements in them. Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty.
State: **`d_queue` and `r_queue` are queues and both queues are not empty.**
