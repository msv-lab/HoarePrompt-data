Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` contains at least 2 characters. If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` contains the value of `i` and `r_queue` remains unchanged. If `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains 2 elements with the second element being the value of `i`, `d_queue` remains unchanged. In both cases, `i` is the index of the last character processed + 1, and either `d_queue` appends the value of `i` if `v` is 'D', or `r_queue` appends the value of `i` if `v` is not 'D'.***
