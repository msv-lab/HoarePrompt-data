Postcondition: ***If fractions is not empty, the loop iterates through each fraction, incrementing either depublicans or remocrats based on the value of the fraction. The final state shows the total count of depublicans and remocrats after processing all fractions. If fractions is empty, depublicans and remocrats remain 0. If depublicans is greater than remocrats, 'D' is printed; otherwise, 'R' is printed.***
