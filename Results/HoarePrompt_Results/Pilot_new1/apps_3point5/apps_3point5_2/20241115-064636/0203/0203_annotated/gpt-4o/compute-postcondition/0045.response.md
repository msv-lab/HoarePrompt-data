Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, after the execution of the loop, the employees will be categorized based on their political affiliation into `d_queue` and `r_queue`. If all employees have the same political affiliation, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will contain all the indices. If `n` is 0, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will remain empty. The loop control variables `d_index` and `r_index` will hold the values popped from the front of their respective queues. Depending on the comparison between `d_index` and `r_index`, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will potentially have one more element with the value `index + n`, while the other queue will have one less element. If the loop ends due to one of the queues becoming empty, the last values of `d_index` and `r_index` will hold the last popped values from their respective queues. After the if else block executes, if `d_queue` is not empty, the program prints 'D'. Otherwise, the program prints 'R'.***
