Example Answer: 
The list `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `n` and `votes` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` contains n characters representing the political affiliation of each employee, `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` contains n characters representing the political affiliation of each employee, `d_queue` is an empty list**
