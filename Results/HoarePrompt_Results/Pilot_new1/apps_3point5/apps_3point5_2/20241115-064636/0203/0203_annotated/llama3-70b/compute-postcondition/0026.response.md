Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the user and a string of fractions. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) in the fractions. After processing all fractions, it prints 'D' if the number of depublicans is greater than the number of remocrats; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If the input fractions are empty, it prints 'R' by default.**
