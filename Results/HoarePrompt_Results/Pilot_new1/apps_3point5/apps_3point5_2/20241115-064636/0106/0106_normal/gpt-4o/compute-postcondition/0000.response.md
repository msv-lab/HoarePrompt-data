Example Answer:
The value of `block` is calculated based on the value of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `apartment` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `block`. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n, m, k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n, m, k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
