Example Answer:
The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` using the formula (apartment - 1) % (m * k). The previous values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k.
Output State: **`block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k**.
