Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split after converting to integers; `a` and `b` are the input integers, `a_floor` is the calculated value based on the formula, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided, `b_block` is calculated as ((b - 1) // (m * k)) + 1, and `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15. The condition (a_floor > b_floor) is false, so the program enters the else block.***
