According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of the count operation, and `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
