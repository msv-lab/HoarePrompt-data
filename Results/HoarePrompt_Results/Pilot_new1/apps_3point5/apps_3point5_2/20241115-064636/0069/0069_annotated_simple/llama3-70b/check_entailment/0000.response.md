Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string.
2. It calculates the balance of the string based on the count of '0's and '1's in the string.
3. It then checks three conditions as described in the problem statement:
    - If the balance is equal to the desired balance, it prints n + 1.
    - If the difference between the desired balance and the calculated balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's, it prints -1.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes needed to reach the desired balance and prints that value.
4. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each test case.
