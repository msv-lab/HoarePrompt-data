Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of the differences between the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and update `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of length 1 filled with zeros. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` appends -1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` appends 0. If `balance` is not 0, the loop iterates through `prefix_balances`, incrementing `count` by 1 for each element `b` that satisfies the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. After the loop execution, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `balance` is 0 if the initial balance was 0, and `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that meet the conditions. `results` will have the count appended to it.***
