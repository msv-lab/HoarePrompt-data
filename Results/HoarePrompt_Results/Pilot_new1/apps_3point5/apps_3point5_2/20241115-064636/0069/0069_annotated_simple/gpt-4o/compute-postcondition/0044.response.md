Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, which means `x` will take the integer value at the next index of `data` after `index`. The value of `x` can be any integer value based on the data list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`**
