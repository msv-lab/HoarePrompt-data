Example Answer: 
`count` is increased by 1, and the previous value of `count` is 2. After execution, `count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length 2 filled with zeros, `balance` is 0, `count` is 3.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length 2 filled with zeros, `balance` is 0, `count` is 3**
