Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `count` is an integer, incremented by 1 if the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is true. `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the if statement execution, ensuring that the variables maintain their initial constraints and relationships.***
