Output State: 
If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. After each iteration of the loop, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to be the sum of the previous element and 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0', else subtract 1. The loop updates `balance` and `index` accordingly. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. 
Therefore, the output state is that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is a specific value, `s` is set to a specific value, `index` is adjusted, `balance` is updated, `prefix_balances` is updated. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute.
