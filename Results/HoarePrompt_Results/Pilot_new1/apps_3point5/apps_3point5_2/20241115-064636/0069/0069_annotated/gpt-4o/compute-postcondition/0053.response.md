According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is a specific value, `s` is set to a specific value, `index` is adjusted to reflect the new index value, `balance` is updated, `prefix_balances` is updated. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be one more than the previous value of `i`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be one more than the previous value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is a specific value, `s` is set to a specific value, `index` is adjusted to reflect the new index value, `balance` is updated, `prefix_balances` is updated, `i` is one more than the previous value of `i`**
