Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is a specific value, `s` is set to a specific value, `index` is adjusted, `balance` is either updated to 0 or remains unchanged, `prefix_balances` is updated with at least 1 element, and `count` is increased by the specified criteria in the loop. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, the `results` list appends -1; if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, the `results` list appends 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is incremented based on the conditions met in the loop.***
