Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2. `count` is an integer that is incremented by 1 if the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is true, where `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances`.***
