According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in `results`, and the value of `result` is printed. To execute the loop one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and the next iteration should be on the second element in the list.
State: **`prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in `results`, and the value of `result` is printed**
