Output State: **If n is at least 1, the loop will iterate through the results list, print each element, and terminate. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. If balance reaches 0 during the loop execution, the loop exits early. If x is in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to the results list. If x is not in prefix_balances, 0 is appended. In the else part, count is increased by the number of elements in prefix_balances that meet the condition, and the appended count value is stored in the results list.**
