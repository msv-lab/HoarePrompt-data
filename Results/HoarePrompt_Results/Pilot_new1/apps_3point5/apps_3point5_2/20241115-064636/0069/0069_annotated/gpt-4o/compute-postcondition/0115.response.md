Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Each element in `prefix_balances` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. If `balance` is equal to 0, the program checks if `x` is in `prefix_balances`. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`; otherwise, `0` is appended. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is an integer that increments by 1 for each element `b` in `prefix_balances` that satisfies the conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0). The loop does not execute if `n` is 0 or lower, in which case `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros and `count` remains 0. The `results` list contains the appended value of `count`, considering all possible edge cases and scenarios.***
