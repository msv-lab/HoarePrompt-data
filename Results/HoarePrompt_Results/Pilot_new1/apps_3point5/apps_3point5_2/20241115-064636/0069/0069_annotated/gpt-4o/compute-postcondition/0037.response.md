Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1. `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances. No changes are made to `prefix_balances` or `b` in the if block.***
