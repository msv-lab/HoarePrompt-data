Output State: 
- If T is greater than 0, the loop will execute T times. 
- After each iteration, n and x are assigned new integer values from the input, s is assigned a new string from the input. 
- cnt0 holds the count of '0' characters in s, cnt1 holds the count of '1' characters in s. 
- balance is calculated as the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. 
- If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. 
- If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. 
- Otherwise, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. 
- This covers all possible scenarios including edge cases where the denominator could be zero, ensuring the correct output based on the conditions stated.
- If T is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and no output is produced.
