According to the code, the loop will execute `T` number of times. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
