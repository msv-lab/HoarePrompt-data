Postcondition: ***`T`, `n + 1`, `x` remain the same, `n` and `x` have new integer values, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` holds the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` holds the count of '1' characters in `s`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If the condition (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0 is satisfied, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if else block, including the edge cases where the denominator could be zero.***
