Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `count` is an integer that is incremented by 1 for each element `b` in `prefix_balances` that satisfies the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0). The loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or lower, in which case `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros and `count` remains 0. `results` contains the appended value of `count`.**
