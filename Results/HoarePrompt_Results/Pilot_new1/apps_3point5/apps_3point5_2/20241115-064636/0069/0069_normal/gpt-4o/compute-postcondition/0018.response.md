According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`, `s` is the value of `data` at index `index + 2`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with all elements as 0, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 0, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`
