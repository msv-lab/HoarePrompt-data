According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be incremented by 1 again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string, prefix_balances is a list containing the prefix sums of '0's and '1's in 's' up to index i, `n` is incremented by 2, `x` is updated based on the data list, `index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in 's, prefix_balances = updated to reflect the prefix sums**
