Example Answer:
The counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s` are calculated and assigned to `cnt0` and `cnt1` respectively. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: T is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are recalculated.
Output State: **T is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are recalculated**
