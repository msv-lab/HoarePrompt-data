Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, `n` and `x` are input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. The balance is not equal to x. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) is 0, the code prints -1. Otherwise, the code prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This covers all possible scenarios where the code calculates and prints the appropriate result based on the conditions provided.***
