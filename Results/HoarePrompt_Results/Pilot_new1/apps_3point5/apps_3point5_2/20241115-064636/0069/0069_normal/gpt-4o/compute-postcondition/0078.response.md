Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list containing the updated prefix sums, `n` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `x` is updated based on the data list, `index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `count` is an integer. If `balance` equals 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to the `results` list. If `balance` equals 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then 0 is appended to the `results` list. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` where ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0). If `prefix_balances` is empty, `count` is 0. The `results` list contains the updated values of `count`.***
