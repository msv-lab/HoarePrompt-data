According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the key states that need adjustment are `i`, `n`, and `prefix_balances`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`, `s` is the value of `data` at index `index + 2`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with all elements as 0, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0.
