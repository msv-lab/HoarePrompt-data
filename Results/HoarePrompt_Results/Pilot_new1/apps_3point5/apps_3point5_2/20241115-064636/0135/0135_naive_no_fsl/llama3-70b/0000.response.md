Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of seen remainders. If a remainder is already in the set, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. The program then prints "Yes" if all remainders are distinct. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
