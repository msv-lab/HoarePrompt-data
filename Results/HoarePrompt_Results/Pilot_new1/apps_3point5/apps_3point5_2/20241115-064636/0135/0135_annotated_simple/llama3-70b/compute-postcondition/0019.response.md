Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the updated values of `remainder`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration. If `remainder` is in `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
