According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration + 1, `remainder` is the result of n % i. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `remainder` needs to be updated based on the new `i`.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration + 1, `remainder` is the result of n % i where i is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration + 1**
