According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `k`, the next value of `i` should be the last value of `i` + 1. Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration.**
