Example Answer:
The set `seen` is initialized as an empty set. The variables `n` and `k` are input integers, and they are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is an empty set**
