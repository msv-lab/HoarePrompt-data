Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. The initial value of `n` is unknown, and `i` is 2. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, k ≥ 1, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2.
Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, k ≥ 1, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2**
