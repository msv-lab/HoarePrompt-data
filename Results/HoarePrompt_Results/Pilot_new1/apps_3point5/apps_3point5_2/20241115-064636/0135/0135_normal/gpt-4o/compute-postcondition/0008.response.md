Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `i` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, i = 1, k ≥ 1, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. If `remainder` is in the list of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the program fragment.***
