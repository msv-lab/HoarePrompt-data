Output State: **If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute. If n is 0 or negative, the loop executes once with i as 1, remainder as 0, and seen containing 0. If n is positive, the loop executes k times, with i ranging from 1 to k, remainder being the result of n % i, and seen containing unique remainders. If a duplicate remainder is found, the program prints 'No' and exits.**
