Example Answer: 
The set `seen_remainders` is initialized as an empty set. This initialization does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, which are integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
