Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It checks if all the remainders obtained from dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the unique remainders and returns 'No' if a repeated remainder is found. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The annotations also accurately describe the functionality of the code, explaining the conditions under which 'No' is returned. The code covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description and the examples provided.
