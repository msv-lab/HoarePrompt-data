The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraint 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k >= n. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.

Case_2: After the loop executes, `seen_remainders` is a set containing all unique remainders obtained from `n % i` where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated, the loop returns 'No'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute.

Case_3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `n` and `k` satisfying the given constraints, and based on the conditions described above, return either 'No' or 'Yes'.
