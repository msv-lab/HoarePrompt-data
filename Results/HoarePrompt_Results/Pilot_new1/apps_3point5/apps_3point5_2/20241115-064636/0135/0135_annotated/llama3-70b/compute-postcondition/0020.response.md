Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the remainders of n divided by 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 3. If the remainder of n divided by 2 is in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, `seen` is updated with the new `remainder`. `seen` is updated with the new `remainder`.**
