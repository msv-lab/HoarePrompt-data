According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If `remainder` is already present in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `i` is less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, where `i` is less than `k`.**
