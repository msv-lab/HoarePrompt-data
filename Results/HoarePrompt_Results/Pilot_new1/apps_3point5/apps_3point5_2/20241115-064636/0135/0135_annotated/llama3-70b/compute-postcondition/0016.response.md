Output State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the remainder of n divided by 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 2, and if the remainder of n divided by 2 is in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits, `seen` is updated with the new `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 3.
