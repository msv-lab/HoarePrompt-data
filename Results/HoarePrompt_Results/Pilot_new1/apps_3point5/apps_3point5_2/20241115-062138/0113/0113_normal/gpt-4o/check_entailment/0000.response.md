Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the given problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the `k`-rounding of `n` by finding the minimum positive integer `x` such that `x` ends with `k` or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by `n`. This is achieved by calculating the multiplier as `10 ** k`, and then finding `x` as `n` multiplied by `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. This logic correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. 

Therefore, the code is correct.
