According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `n % x != 0` is satisfied. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer with a remainder when divided by `x` + 1 and `n` is not divisible by `x` after incrementing `n` by 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be incremented by 1 in order to satisfy the condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer with a remainder when divided by `x` + 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 and `n` is not divisible by `x` after incrementing `n` by 1**
