Postcondition: ***s is an input integer such that 0 <= s <= 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, tens is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety. If s is less than 10, the code prints the string representation of the number s from the list ones. If s is between 10 and 19, the code prints the string representation of the number corresponding to s minus 10 from the list of teens. For s between 20 and 99, the code prints the string representation of the input integer s in words, considering all possible cases and edge scenarios within the specified range of values for s. The program correctly handles all boundary values and edge cases within the given range.***
