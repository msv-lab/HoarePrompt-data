Example Answer:
The list `ones` is assigned a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine. Since the list is assigned directly and no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine**
