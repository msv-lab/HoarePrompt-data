The function does not accept any parameters. It takes an input integer `s` and prints out the corresponding word representation based on the value of `s`. The function handles cases where `s` is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and between 20 and 99. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word representation from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word representation from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 20 and 99, it prints the concatenation of the word representation for the tens place and ones place from the `tens` and `ones` lists, respectively, with a hyphen in between if needed. The function covers all edge cases for the given input range.
