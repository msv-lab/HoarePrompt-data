The function func_1 accepts an integer n and returns the string representation of that number in words. It covers the ranges from 0 to 9, 11 to 19, and 10 to 99. If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding word from the 'ones' list. If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the word from the 'teens' list. If n is between 10 and 99, excluding the range of 11 to 19, it returns the word representing the tens digit followed by the ones digit separated by a hyphen. The function accurately represents numbers in words within the specified ranges.
