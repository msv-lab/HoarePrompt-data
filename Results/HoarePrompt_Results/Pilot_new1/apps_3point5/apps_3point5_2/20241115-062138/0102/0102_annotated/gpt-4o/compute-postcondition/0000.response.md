Example Answer: 
The list `ones` is initialized with string representations of numbers from zero to nine. The variable `ones` is the only affected variable, and its values are now ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']. Therefore, the Output State is: ones contains string representations of numbers from zero to nine.
Output State: **ones contains string representations of numbers from zero to nine**
