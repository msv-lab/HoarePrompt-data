The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. After executing the function body, if n is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representation of the number n from the 'ones' list. If n is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representation of the number n from the 'teens' list. If n is between 10 and 99, excluding the range of 11 to 19, the function returns the string representation of the tens digit of n if n % 10 == 0. Otherwise, it returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens digit and the ones digit of n separated by a hyphen. The postcondition ensures the correct representation of the number in words for all possible values of n within the specified ranges.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns the string representation of the number n based on the specified ranges and conditions.**
