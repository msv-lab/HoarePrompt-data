Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. It then calculates the maximum possible distance between these two elements by considering the distance between their positions after swapping them. The logic used in the program covers all potential cases and correctly outputs the maximum possible distance. The program also handles cases where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array.
