Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, the minimum distance between these positions, and prints the maximum value between the maximum distance and `n` minus 1. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
