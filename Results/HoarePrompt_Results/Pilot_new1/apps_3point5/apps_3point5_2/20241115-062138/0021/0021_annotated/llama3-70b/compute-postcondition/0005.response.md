Example Answer:
The variable `min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n` minus 2. The variables `a`, `pos1`, and `max_dist` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a` (if 1 is present), `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a` (if 1 is present), `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance**
