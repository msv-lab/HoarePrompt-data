Example Answer:
The variable `posn` is assigned the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, so the index of `n` in the list will be `n-1`. Therefore, `posn` is assigned the value `n-1`, and `pos1` remains 0. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is n-1**
