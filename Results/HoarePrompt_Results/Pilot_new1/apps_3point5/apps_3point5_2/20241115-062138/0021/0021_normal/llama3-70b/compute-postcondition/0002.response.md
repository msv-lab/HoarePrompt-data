Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the integer 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to variable `pos1`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and n, the index of 1 in the list will be the position of 1 in the list. Therefore, `pos1` will be the position of 1 in the list `a`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, `pos1` is the position of 1 in the list `a`**
