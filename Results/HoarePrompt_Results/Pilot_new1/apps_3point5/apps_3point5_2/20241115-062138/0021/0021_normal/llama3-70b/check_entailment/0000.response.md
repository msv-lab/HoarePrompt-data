Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads an integer `n` representing the size of the permutation and a list of `n` distinct integers.
- It correctly calculates the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (`n`) in the list.
- The code then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list and the minimum distance between these positions.
- Finally, it prints the maximum of these two distances or `n - 1 - min_dist`.
- The program handles the case where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array by calculating the maximum distance possible.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for the given examples.
