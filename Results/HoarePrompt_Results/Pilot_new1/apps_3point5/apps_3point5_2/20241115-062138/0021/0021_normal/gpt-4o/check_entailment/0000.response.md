Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The code does not handle the case where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array. In such a case, the maximum possible distance is already achieved without needing to perform any swap. However, the code does not check for this scenario and always calculates the maximum distance based on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, even if they are already at the maximum distance apart. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
In this case, the minimum element 1 is at position 5 and the maximum element 6 is at position 0, which already gives a maximum distance of 5. However, the code will calculate the distances and output 5, suggesting a swap is needed to achieve the maximum distance, which is incorrect.
