Example Answer:
The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the value 1 in the list `a`. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`**
