Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, calculating the maximum possible distance between them by performing one swap, and then outputting the maximum distance. The logic used in the program covers all potential cases and ensures that the distance between the minimum and maximum elements is maximized after the swap.
