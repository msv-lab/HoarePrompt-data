Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values N and K, followed by a list of integers A, which aligns with the problem description.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in A, which is a valid step in finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
- It then finds the largest factor of the gcd that is less than or equal to the square root of the gcd, which is in line with the problem description.
- Finally, it prints the maximum divisor obtained, which is the expected output based on the problem description.
- The code covers all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description, so the correctness is True.
