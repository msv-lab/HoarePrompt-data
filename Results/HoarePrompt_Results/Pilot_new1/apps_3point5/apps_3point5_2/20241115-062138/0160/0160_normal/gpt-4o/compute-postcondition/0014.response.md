According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `i` is one more than the previous value. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
