Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is already a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is the divisor for `gcd`, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum of the two perfect squares. The value of `gcd` remains unchanged, and `K` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, `gcd` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, `gcd` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9**
