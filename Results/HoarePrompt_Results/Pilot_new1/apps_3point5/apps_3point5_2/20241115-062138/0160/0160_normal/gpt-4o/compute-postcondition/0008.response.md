Example Answer:
The value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` including `i`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 1, the set `divisors` now includes the new factor `x // i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` including `i` and `x // i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` including `i` and `x // i**`.
