Example Answer:
The list A is assigned the values obtained by mapping each input integer after splitting the input string by spaces. The values of N and K are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9.
Output State: **N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9**
