According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is assigned a value, `K` is assigned a value, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the gcd of the previous value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` in list `A`, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`N` is assigned a value, `K` is assigned a value, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the gcd of the previous value of `gcd` and the element at index `2` in list `A`, `i` is 2**
