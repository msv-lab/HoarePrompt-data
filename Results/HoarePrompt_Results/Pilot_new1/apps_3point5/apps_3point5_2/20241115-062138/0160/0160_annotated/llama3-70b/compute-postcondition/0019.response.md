According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is at least 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N`, `K` are assigned values obtained from input, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A` and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is at least 2, `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i` where `max_divisor` is divisible by `i`. If the square of `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.**
