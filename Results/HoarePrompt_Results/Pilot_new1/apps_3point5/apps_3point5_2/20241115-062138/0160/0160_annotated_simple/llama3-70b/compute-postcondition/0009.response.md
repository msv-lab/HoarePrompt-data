According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 501. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `N` and `N` should be an integer between 2 and 500.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A**
