Example Answer:
`divisors` is a set that contains divisors of `x`, and a new divisor is added to `divisors` which is `x // i`, where `i` is a divisor of `x`. The set `divisors` is updated with the new divisor. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, `x` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` is a set containing divisors of `x` with the newly added divisor `x // i`.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, `x` is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` is a set containing divisors of `x` with the newly added divisor `x // i`**
