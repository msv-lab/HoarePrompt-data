According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 501. To execute the loop one more time, `N` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need adjustment.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 501, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A**
