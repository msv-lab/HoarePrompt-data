Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is a positive integer, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `i`. Additionally, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`.***
