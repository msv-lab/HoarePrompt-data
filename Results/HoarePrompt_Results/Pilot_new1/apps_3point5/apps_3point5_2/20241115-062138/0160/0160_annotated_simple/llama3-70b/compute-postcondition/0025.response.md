Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The value of `gcd` is not affected, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1**
