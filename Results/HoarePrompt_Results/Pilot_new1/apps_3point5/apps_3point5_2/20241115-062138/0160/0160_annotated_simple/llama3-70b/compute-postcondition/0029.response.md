According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` is updated, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `max_divisor` needs to be updated based on the conditions in the loop.
State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1**
