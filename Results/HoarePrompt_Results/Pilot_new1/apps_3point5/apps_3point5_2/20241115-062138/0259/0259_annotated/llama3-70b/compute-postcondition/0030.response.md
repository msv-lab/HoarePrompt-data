Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `min_time`, `ans` are positive integers. `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples. `i` is increased by 1. `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, then `min_time` is updated to the new time value and `ans` is increased by 1. Overall, the program updates `min_time` and `ans` based on the calculated time, ensuring they are positive integers, while `i` is incremented by 1. This process occurs within the context of a list of tuples `buses` with at least 2 tuples.***
