Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `min_time`, `ans` are positive integers, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 1, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. If the calculated `time` is less than the current `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to the new `time`, and `ans` is increased by 1, representing the new optimal time and bus index.***
