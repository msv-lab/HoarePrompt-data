According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 2 tuples, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `t`, `min_time`, `ans` are positive integers, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 1, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. If the calculated `time` is less than the current `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to the new `time`, and `ans` is increased by 1. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `buses` list must have at least 2 tuples, and `i` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `t`, `min_time`, `ans` are positive integers, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is increased by 1, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`**
