Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values by splitting the input into integers. The input is split by spaces and converted into integers. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list with at least one element, `s` is an integer, `d` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list with at least one element, `s` is an integer, `d` is an integer**
