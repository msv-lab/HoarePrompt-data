Example Answer: 
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The `buses` list already contains at least one element, so after execution, the `buses` list will have one additional tuple. The values of `n`, `t`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list with at least two elements, `s` is an integer, `d` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list with at least two elements, `s` is an integer, `d` is an integer**
