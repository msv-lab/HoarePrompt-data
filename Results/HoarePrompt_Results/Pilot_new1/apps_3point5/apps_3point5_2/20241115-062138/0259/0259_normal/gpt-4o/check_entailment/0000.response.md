Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes the input values correctly and stores them in a list of tuples representing bus routes.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route based on the current time `t` and the arrival times and intervals of the buses.
- It then returns the route number corresponding to the minimum wait time.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the provided examples.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
