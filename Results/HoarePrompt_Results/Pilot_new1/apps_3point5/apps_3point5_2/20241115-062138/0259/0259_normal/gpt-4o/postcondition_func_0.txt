The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates through the bus routes, calculates the minimum wait time based on the current time `t` and the bus routes' arrival times and intervals. The function then returns the route number corresponding to the minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the function will return -1.
