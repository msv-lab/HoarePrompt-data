Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least two tuples, `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, `ans` is equal to i + 1, `i` is 1, `(s, d)` is the second tuple in `buses`, `time` is calculated as described. If the calculated `time` is less than the previous `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the new `time` and `ans` is updated to i + 1.***
