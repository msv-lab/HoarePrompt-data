Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `chosen_route` is a valid route value, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from the tuple `bus_routes[i+1]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The postcondition covers all possible cases where `wait_time` is either 0 or calculated based on the given formula.***
