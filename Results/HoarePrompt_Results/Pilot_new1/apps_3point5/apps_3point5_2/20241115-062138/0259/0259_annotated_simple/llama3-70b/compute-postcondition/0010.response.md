Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` with the newly appended values of `s` and `d`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` with the newly appended values of `s` and `d**.
