Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station.
2. It then reads the arrival time and interval for each bus route and stores them in a list of tuples.
3. It calculates the time difference between Serval's arrival time and the first bus arrival time for each route, taking into account the intervals between buses.
4. It correctly determines which bus route Serval will use based on the minimum time difference calculated.
5. The program outputs the bus route that Serval will use.
6. The logic of the program is consistent with the problem description, and it handles all potential cases as described.
