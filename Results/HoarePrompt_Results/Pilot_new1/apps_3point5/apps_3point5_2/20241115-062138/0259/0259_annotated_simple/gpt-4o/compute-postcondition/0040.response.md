The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes. 
- `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station. 
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns an integer representing the route chosen based on the minimum wait time. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of tuples representing bus routes. It then calculates and returns the route chosen based on the minimum wait time. 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, t, and bus_routes, calculates the route chosen based on the minimum wait time, and returns the corresponding integer.**
