Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split by space. Since the input is not provided, the specific values of `n` and `m` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition**: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. counts is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ Σ(k_i) ≤ n.**
