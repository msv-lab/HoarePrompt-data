Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The value of `color` is not provided, so the resulting value of `color_counts[color]` depends on the initial value of `color_counts[color]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 colors, `counts` is a list of integers created from the input values, and `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated values based on the increment operation.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 colors, `counts` is a list of integers created from the input values, and `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated values based on the increment operation**
