Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, `current_counts` is updated with the incremented value, `left` is 0, and `right` is n. If all values in `current_counts` match the desired counts for each color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
