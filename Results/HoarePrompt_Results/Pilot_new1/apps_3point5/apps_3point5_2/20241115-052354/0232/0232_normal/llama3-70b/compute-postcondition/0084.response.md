Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. `i` is the starting index for the loop. `n` is the upper bound of the loop. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
