Output State: 

If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute. 
If `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute.
If `colors` has elements and all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is True and the loop breaks.
After the loop executes, `window_counts` is a dictionary where each color encountered in the loop has an incremented count. `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i`.
