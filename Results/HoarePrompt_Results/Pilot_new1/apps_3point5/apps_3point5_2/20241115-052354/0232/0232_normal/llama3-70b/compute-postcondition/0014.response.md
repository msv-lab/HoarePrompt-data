Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0 for a specific color. The other variables `colors` and `counts` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 colors, `counts` is a list of integers created from the input values, and `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated values based on the increment operation where the specific color is initialized to 0.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 colors, `counts` is a list of integers created from the input values, and `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated values based on the increment operation where the specific color is initialized to 0**
