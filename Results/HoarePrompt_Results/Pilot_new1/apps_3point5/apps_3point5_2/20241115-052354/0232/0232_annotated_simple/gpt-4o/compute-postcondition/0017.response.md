Example Answer:
The value in `current_counts` at the index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` may not have the same values as `desired_counts`, `left` is at a value where at least one color in `current_counts` has a value less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, `right` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`current_counts` may not have the same values as `desired_counts`, `left` is at a value where at least one color in `current_counts` has a value less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, `right` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0**
