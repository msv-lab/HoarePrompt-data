Postcondition: ***found is a boolean. If all the counts in window_counts are equal to the corresponding targets in counts, found is set to True and the loop breaks. The variables n, m, counts, colors, color_counts, i, window_counts, j, color, and window_counts[color] are all updated as described in the precondition. The program handles the case where the counts match the targets, setting found to True and breaking the loop.***
