According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, the initial state should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`colors` is not empty, `counts` remains the same, `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique color in the `colors` list, `found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`.**
