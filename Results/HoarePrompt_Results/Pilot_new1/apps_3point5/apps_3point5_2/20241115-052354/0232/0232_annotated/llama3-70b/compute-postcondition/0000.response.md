Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values from the input split by space. Since the input values are not known, the exact values of `n` and `m` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition**: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n.**
