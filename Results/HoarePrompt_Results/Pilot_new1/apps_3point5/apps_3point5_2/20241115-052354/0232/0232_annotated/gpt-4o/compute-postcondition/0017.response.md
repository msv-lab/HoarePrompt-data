Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` is incremented by 1 in `current_counts`. The index `right` is less than `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is the index where the loop stops, `right` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is the index where the loop stops, `right` is less than `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0**
