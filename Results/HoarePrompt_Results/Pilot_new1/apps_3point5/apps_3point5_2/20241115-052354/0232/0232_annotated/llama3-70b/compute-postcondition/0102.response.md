Output State: **`window_counts` is updated with `color` having an incremented count. `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts` after sorting. `i` is the next index value, `n` remains greater than or equal to `i`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a count of 0.**
