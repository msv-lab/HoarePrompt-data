Example Answer:
After incrementing the value of `window_counts[color]` by 1, all counts of colors in `window_counts` remain equal to the corresponding target counts specified in `counts`. The variable `found` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Therefore, the Output State is: After incrementing the value of `window_counts[color]` by 1, all counts of colors in `window_counts` remain equal to the corresponding target counts specified in `counts`; `found` is True.
Output State: **After incrementing the value of `window_counts[color]` by 1, all counts of colors in `window_counts` remain equal to the corresponding target counts specified in `counts`; `found` is True**
