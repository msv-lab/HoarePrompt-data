Example Answer:
The user inputs are split and converted to integers using `map` and `int`, then stored in the `counts` list. The previous state of `colors` is unknown, so the output state is: `colors` is a list of integers containing the user input values, `counts` is a list of integers from user input.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers containing the user input values, `counts` is a list of integers from user input**
