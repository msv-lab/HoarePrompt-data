Output State: **After the loop executes, `colors` remains the same, `counts` remains the same, and `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique color in the `colors` list. If `colors` is empty, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. `found` is initialized to False.**
