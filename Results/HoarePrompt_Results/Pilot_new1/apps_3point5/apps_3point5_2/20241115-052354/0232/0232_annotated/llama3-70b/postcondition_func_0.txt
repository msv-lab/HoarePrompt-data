The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, colors, and counts. It then creates a dictionary `color_counts` to store the count of each unique color in the `colors` list. After that, it iterates through the `colors` list to update a `window_counts` dictionary with the count of each color encountered. If the counts in `window_counts` match the counts list, it sets `found` to True and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `found` is True, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
