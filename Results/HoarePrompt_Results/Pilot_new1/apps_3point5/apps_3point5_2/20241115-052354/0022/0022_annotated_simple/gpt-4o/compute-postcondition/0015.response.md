Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It iterates through the string to check if the characters at symmetric positions are equal. If all pairs of characters are equal, it returns True. If there exists at least one pair of characters that are not equal, it returns False. If the length of string `s` is less than 2, the function directly returns True.**
