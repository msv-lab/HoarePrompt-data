Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`, `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `is_spalindrome` is False.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`, `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `is_spalindrome` is False**
