Output State: **If the length of string s is at least 2, the loop checks if the characters at positions i and n - 1 - i are equal for i less than n // 2. If there exists at least one pair of characters that are not equal, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not return False. If the length of string s is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
