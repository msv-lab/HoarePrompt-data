Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of even length between 2 and 1000, `n` is an even integer, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `is_spalindrome` is True. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop is broken. This covers all possible cases for the given program fragment.***
