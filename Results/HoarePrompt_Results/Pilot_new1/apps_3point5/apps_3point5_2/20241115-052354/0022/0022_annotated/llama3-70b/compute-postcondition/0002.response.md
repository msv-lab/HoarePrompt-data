Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This indicates that the initial assumption is that `s` is a palindrome. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 consisting of only English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 consisting of only English letters, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `is_spalindrome` is True**
