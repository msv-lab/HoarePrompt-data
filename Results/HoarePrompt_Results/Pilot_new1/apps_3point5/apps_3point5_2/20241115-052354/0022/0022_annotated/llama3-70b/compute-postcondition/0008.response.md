According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is terminated. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n // 2`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n // 2`.
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n // 2**.
