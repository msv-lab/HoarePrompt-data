Functionality: The function reads a string `s` from user input, calculates its length `n`, and then iterates through the first half of the string to check if it is a palindrome. If the characters at symmetric positions are not equal, it sets `is_spalindrome` to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, and 'NIE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. It operates on a string `s` of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters.
