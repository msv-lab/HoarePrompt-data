According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is less than `n // 2`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1**
