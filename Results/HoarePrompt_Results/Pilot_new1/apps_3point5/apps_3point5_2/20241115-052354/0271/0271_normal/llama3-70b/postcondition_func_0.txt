The function prompts the user for an integer `n` and then processes it based on the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it prints `n` without the units place if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, or it prints `n` rounded up to the nearest tens place if the remainder is greater than 5. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
