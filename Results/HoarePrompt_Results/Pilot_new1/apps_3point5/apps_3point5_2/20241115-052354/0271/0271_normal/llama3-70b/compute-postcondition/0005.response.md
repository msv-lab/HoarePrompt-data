Example Answer: 
The expression `n - n % 10` calculates the value of `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` is not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the value of `n - n % 10` will be the tens place of `n`. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, and the tens place of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, and the tens place of `n`**
