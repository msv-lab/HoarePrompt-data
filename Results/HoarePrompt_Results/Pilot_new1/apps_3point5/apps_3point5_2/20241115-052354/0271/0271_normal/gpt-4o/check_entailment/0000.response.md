Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an integer input `n` and calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Based on the value of the remainder, it adjusts `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the remainder from `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n`. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, as it correctly handles the rounding of `n` to the nearest integer ending in 0. The code covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that the output is accurate for any non-negative integer `n`.
