Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly rounds the given number to the nearest integer that ends with 0 as per the problem description. It checks if the number is already ending with 0, then prints the number itself. If the last digit of the number is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the last digit. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the last digit. This logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
