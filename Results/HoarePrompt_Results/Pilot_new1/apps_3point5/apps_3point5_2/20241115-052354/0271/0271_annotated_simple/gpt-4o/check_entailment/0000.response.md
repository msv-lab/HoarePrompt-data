Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes an input integer n, calculates the remainder when divided by 10, and then based on the value of the remainder, rounds n to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The logic implemented in the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases. The if-else block correctly handles the scenarios where the remainder is less than or equal to 5 or between 6 and 9, ensuring that the rounding is done as required. The program covers all possible cases and provides the correct output.
