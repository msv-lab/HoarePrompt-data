Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer input `n` from the user and then prints a modified version of `n` based on the last digit of `n`. If the last digit of `n` is 0, it prints `n`. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n - n % 10`. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it prints `n + (10 - n % 10)`. The function covers all scenarios where the last digit of `n` falls into these categories, ensuring the correct mathematical operation is performed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
