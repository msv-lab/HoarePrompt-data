Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes an integer input n and rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The program correctly handles all cases where the last digit of n is either less than or equal to 5, or greater than 5, by performing the appropriate mathematical operation to round n to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description provided. All the given examples in the problem description are covered by the program and produce the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
