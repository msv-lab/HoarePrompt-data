You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a non-negative integer n. He wants to round it to nearest integer, which ends up with 0. If n already ends up with 0, Vasya considers it already rounded.

For example, if n = 4722 answer is 4720. If n = 5 Vasya can round it to 0 or to 10. Both ways are correct.

For given n find out to which integer will Vasya round it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — number that Vasya has.


-----Output-----

Print result of rounding n. Pay attention that in some cases answer isn't unique. In that case print any correct answer.


-----Examples-----
Input
5

Output
0

Input
113

Output
110

Input
1000000000

Output
1000000000

Input
5432359

Output
5432360



-----Note-----

In the first example n = 5. Nearest integers, that ends up with zero are 0 and 10. Any of these answers is correct, so you can print 0 or 10.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n % 10 == 0) :
        print(n)
    else :
        if (n % 10 <= 5) :
            print(n - n % 10)
        else :
            print(n + (10 - n % 10))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer such that n % 10 is not equal to 0. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n - n % 10. If n % 10 is larger than 5, the program prints n + (10 - n % 10). The overall state of the program after the if else block is executed covers all cases where the last digit of n is either less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5, ensuring that the correct mathematical operation is performed based on the condition.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n % 10 == 0, the program prints n. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n - n % 10. If n % 10 is larger than 5, the program prints n + (10 - n % 10). The postcondition ensures that the correct mathematical operation is executed based on the condition of the last digit of n, covering all scenarios where the last digit is either less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
