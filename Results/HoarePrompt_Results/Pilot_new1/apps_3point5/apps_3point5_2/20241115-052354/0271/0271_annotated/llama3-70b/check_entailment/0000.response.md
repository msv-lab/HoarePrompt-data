Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it is evident that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly handles the scenario where the input integer `n` is already divisible by 10, in which case it prints `n`. It also correctly handles the cases where `n` is not divisible by 10, rounding `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The annotations provide a clear explanation of how the code operates and confirms that all possible scenarios within the given constraints are covered. Since there are no examples provided where the code does not work as expected and the annotations align with the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
