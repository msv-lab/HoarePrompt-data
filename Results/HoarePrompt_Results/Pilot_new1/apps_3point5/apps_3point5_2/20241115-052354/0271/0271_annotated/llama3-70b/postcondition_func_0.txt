The function `func` prompts the user for input and then prints a modified version of the input based on certain conditions. If the input integer `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it prints `n - (n % 10)` if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, or it prints `n + (10 - n % 10)` if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is greater than 5. The function handles non-negative integers within the range 0 to 10^9.
