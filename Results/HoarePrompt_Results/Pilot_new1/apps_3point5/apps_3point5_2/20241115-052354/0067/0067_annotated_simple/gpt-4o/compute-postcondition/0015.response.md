Functionality: **The function reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from user input. It then calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on the input values. If max_upvotes is less than min_downvotes, it prints '-'. If max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. The function covers all possible scenarios based on the input values of x, y, and z and always prints either '-', '+', or '?'.**
