Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It considers all possible scenarios based on the values of x, y, and z and outputs the correct result according to the rules provided. The program covers all edge cases and provides the expected output for each scenario. Since there are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is true.
