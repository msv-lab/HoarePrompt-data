Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x > y + z, the program prints '+'. If x < y, the program prints '-'. If x equals y and z equals 0, the program prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, the program prints '?'. The relationships x is not greater than y+z, x is not less than y, and y is less than or equal to x, z is less than or equal to x are preserved after the execution of the program fragment.***
