Example Answer:
`x, y, z` are assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers. Since the values of `x, y, z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the output state is x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
