Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. 
- If x is greater than the sum of y and z, it prints '+'. 
- If x is less than y, it prints '-'. 
- If x equals y and z equals 0, it prints '0'. 
- If x equals y and z is not 0, it prints '?'. 
- If x is not equal to y, it prints '?'.
The code covers all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
