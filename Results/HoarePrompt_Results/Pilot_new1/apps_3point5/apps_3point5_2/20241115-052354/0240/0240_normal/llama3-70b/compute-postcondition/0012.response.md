According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the set `t_set`. If there are more characters left in `s` to process and the next character is in `t_set`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string representing the remaining part of the large integer after processing the current character, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string with the next character included if it is in `t_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in `s` needs to be in `t_set`. So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` is a string with the next character included if it is in `t_set`.

State: **`s` is a string representing the remaining part of the large integer after processing the current character, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string with the next character included if it is in `t_set`**.
