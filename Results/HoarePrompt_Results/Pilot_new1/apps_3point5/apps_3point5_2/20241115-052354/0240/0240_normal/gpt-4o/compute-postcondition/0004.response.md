Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in `perm`. If the `candidate` is a valid number based on the `is_valid_number` function, then the function yields the `candidate` value. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
