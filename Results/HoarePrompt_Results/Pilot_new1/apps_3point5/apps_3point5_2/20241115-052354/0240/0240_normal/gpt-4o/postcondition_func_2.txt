The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes in two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. `chars` is a non-empty string containing a sequence of digits, and `sub` is a substring of `chars`. The function generates permutations of the characters in `chars`, joins them to form a candidate string, and checks if the candidate string is a valid number by calling the `is_valid_number` function with `candidate` and `sub` as arguments. If the `is_valid_number` function returns true, the function yields the candidate string. The function does not have a specified return value.
