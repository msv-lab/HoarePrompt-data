Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in two strings `s` and `t`, where `s` is the string received by Kate and `t` is the substring of `n` that Vasya remembers.
- The function `func_1` creates a set `t_set` containing the unique characters of string `t`.
- It then iterates through string `s` and concatenates characters that are also present in `t_set` to the string `n`.
- Finally, it appends string `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of the concatenated string `n`.
- The function correctly handles the case when `t_set` is empty, where `n` remains an empty string.
- It also handles the case when `s` is an empty string, where `n` will be equal to `t` converted to an integer.
- The code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, handling all potential cases as described.
