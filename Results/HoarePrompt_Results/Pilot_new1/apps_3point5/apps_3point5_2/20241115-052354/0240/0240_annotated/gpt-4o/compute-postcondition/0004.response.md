Postcondition: ***`candidate` is a string resulting from joining `perm`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the program variables. Ensure that `candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number` and is yielded if it passes the validation.***
