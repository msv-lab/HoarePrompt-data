Example Answer:
The character `c` is concatenated to the string `n`, so the value of `n` changes based on the character `c`. The variables `s`, `t`, and `t_set` remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `t` is a string, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string with the concatenated character `c`**
