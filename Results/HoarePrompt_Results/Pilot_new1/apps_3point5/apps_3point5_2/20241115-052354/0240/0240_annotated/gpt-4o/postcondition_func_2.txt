The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars` and `sub`, where `chars` is a string representing a number and `sub` is a string representing a substring of the number. The function generates permutations of `chars`, converts them to strings, and yields those candidates that are valid numbers according to the `is_valid_number` function. If a valid candidate is found, it is yielded. The function does not have a specific output provided in the constraints.
