According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are permutations of the characters in the `chars` string. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one more digit added to it, `sub` is a valid substring of the updated `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `chars` string should have at least one more digit added to it, and the `sub` substring should still be a valid substring of the updated `chars`. Additionally, the `candidate` should be a valid number with `sub` as a substring of it, and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` should evaluate to true.

State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one more digit added to it, `sub` is a valid substring of the updated `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, then the function yields `candidate`.**
