According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more permutations of the characters in `chars` to explore. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one more digit added to it, `sub` is a valid substring of the updated `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it. For the loop to execute one more time, the `chars` string must have at least one more digit added to it and the permutations must not have been exhausted.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one more digit added to it, `sub` is a valid substring of the updated `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it.**
