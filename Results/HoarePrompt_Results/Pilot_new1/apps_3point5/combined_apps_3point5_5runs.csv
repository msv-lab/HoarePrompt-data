Calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$. The balance of some string $q$ is equal to $cnt_{0, q} - cnt_{1, q}$, where $cnt_{0, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 0 in $q$, and $cnt_{1, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 1 in $q$. The number of such prefixes can be infinite; if it is so, you must say that.

A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string ""abcd"" has 5 prefixes: empty string, ""a"", ""ab"", ""abc"" and ""abcd"".


-----Input-----

The first line contains the single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Next $2T$ lines contain descriptions of test cases — two lines per test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$) — the length of string $s$ and the desired balance, respectively.

The second line contains the binary string $s$ ($|s| = n$, $s_i \in \{\text{0}, \text{1}\}$).

It's guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ doesn't exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

Print $T$ integers — one per test case. For each test case print the number of prefixes or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such prefixes.

The voting procedure is rather complicated:   Each of n employees makes a statement. They make statements one by one starting from employees 1 and finishing with employee n. If at the moment when it's time for the i-th employee to make a statement he no longer has the right to vote, he just skips his turn (and no longer takes part in this voting).  When employee makes a statement, he can do nothing or declare that one of the other employees no longer has a right to vote. It's allowed to deny from voting people who already made the statement or people who are only waiting to do so.

Initially each variable b_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ m) contains the value of zero. Consider the following sequence, consisting of n operations.

The first operation is assigning the value of a_1 to some variable b_{x} (1 ≤ x ≤ m). Each of the following n - 1 operations is assigning to some variable b_{y} the value that is equal to the sum of values that are stored in the variables b_{i} and b_{j} (1 ≤ i, j, y ≤ m). At that, the value that is assigned on the t-th operation, must equal a_{t}. For each operation numbers y, i, j are chosen anew.

Your task is to find the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 23). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that all numbers in the sequence are distinct.

-----Output-----

If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ≥ 0, B ≥ 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.

31,apps,gpt-4o,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,"ZS the Coder has recently found an interesting concept called the Birthday Paradox. It states that given a random set of 23 people, there is around 50% chance that some two of them share the same birthday. ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.

In Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. 

ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?

The next line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$); $s_i$ indicates the opportunity to buy shares at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

The following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 1000$); $b_i$ indicates the opportunity to sell shares at the price of $b_i$ bourles.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.


-----Examples-----

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first example test, you have $11$ bourles in the morning. It's optimal to buy $5$ shares of a stock at the price of $2$ bourles in the morning, and then to sell all of them at the price of $5$ bourles in the evening. It's easy to verify that you'll have $26$ bourles after the evening.

In the second example test, it's optimal not to take any action.","# Reading input

The voting procedure is rather complicated:   Each of n employees makes a statement. They make statements one by one starting from employees 1 and finishing with employee n. If at the moment when it's time for the i-th employee to make a statement he no longer has the right to vote, he just skips his turn (and no longer takes part in this voting).

Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.

Serval will go to the bus station at time $t$, and there are $n$ bus routes which stop at this station. For the $i$-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time $s_i$ minutes, and each bus of this route comes $d_i$ minutes later than the previous one.

259,apps,gpt-4o,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,"It is raining heavily. But this is the first day for Serval, who just became 3 years old, to go to the kindergarten. Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.

Serval will go to the bus station at time $t$, and there are $n$ bus routes which stop at this station. For the $i$-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time $s_i$ minutes, and each bus of this route comes $d_i$ minutes later than the previous one.

As Serval's best friend, you wonder which bus route will he get on. If several buses arrive at the same time, you can print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $t$ ($1\leq n\leq 100$, $1\leq t\leq 10^5$) — the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. 

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two space-separated integers $s_i$ and $d_i$ ($1\leq s_i,d_i\leq 10^5$) — the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route.


-----Output-----

Print one number — what bus route Serval will use. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be ""+""; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be ""-""; otherwise the result will be ""0"".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be ""+""; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be ""-""; otherwise the result will be ""0"".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.

What is the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m, r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 30$, $1 \leq m \leq 30$, $1 \leq r \leq 1000$) — the number of ways to buy the shares on the market, the number of ways to sell the shares on the market, and the number of bourles you hold now.

The next line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$); $s_i$ indicates the opportunity to buy shares at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

The following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 1000$); $b_i$ indicates the opportunity to sell shares at the price of $b_i$ bourles.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.


-----Examples-----

3 4 11
4 2 5
4 4 5 4

Output
26

Input
2 2 50
5 7
4 2

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first example test, you have $11$ bourles in the morning. It's optimal to buy $5$ shares of a stock at the price of $2$ bourles in the morning, and then to sell all of them at the price of $5$ bourles in the evening. It's easy to verify that you'll have $26$ bourles after the evening.

In the second example test, it's optimal not to take any action.","# Reading input

Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights.

Особенность этого дома состоит в том, что он круглый. То есть если обходить его по часовой стрелке, то после подъезда номер 1 следует подъезд номер 2, затем подъезд номер 3 и так далее до подъезда номер n. После подъезда номер n снова идёт подъезд номер 1.

Переход на 1 этаж вверх или вниз по лестнице занимает 5 секунд, переход от двери подъезда к двери соседнего подъезда — 15 секунд, а переход в пределах одного этажа одного подъезда происходит мгновенно. Также в каждом подъезде дома есть лифт. Он устроен следующим образом: он всегда приезжает ровно через 10 секунд после вызова, а чтобы переместить пассажира на один этаж вверх или вниз, лифт тратит ровно 1 секунду. Посадка и высадка происходят мгновенно.

Помогите Эдварду найти минимальное время, за которое он сможет добраться до квартиры Наташи. Считайте, что Эдвард может выйти из подъезда только с первого этажа соответствующего подъезда (это происходит мгновенно). Если Эдвард стоит перед дверью какого-то подъезда, он может зайти в него и сразу окажется на первом этаже этого подъезда (это также происходит мгновенно).

В первом тестовом примере Эдвард находится в 4 подъезде на 10 этаже, а Наташа находится в 1 подъезде на 2 этаже. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно сначала спуститься на лифте на первый этаж (на это он потратит 19 секунд, из которых 10 — на ожидание и 9 — на поездку на лифте), затем обойти дом против часовой стрелки до подъезда номер 1 (на это он потратит 15 секунд), и наконец подняться по лестнице на этаж номер 2 (на это он потратит 5 секунд). Таким образом, ответ равен 19 + 15 + 5 = 39.

Во втором тестовом примере Эдвард живёт в подъезде 2 на этаже 1, а Наташа находится в подъезде 1 на этаже 1. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно просто обойти дом по часовой стрелке до подъезда 1, на это он потратит 15 секунд.","n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

Они пронумерованы естественным образом от 1 до n·m·k, то есть первая квартира на первом этаже в первом подъезде имеет номер 1, первая квартира на втором этаже первого подъезда имеет номер k + 1 и так далее. Особенность этого дома состоит в том, что он круглый. То есть если обходить его по часовой стрелке, то после подъезда номер 1 следует подъезд номер 2, затем подъезд номер 3 и так далее до подъезда номер n. После подъезда номер n снова идёт подъезд номер 1.

Эдвард живёт в квартире номер a, а Наташа — в квартире номер b. Переход на 1 этаж вверх или вниз по лестнице занимает 5 секунд, переход от двери подъезда к двери соседнего подъезда — 15 секунд, а переход в пределах одного этажа одного подъезда происходит мгновенно. Также в каждом подъезде дома есть лифт. Он устроен следующим образом: он всегда приезжает ровно через 10 секунд после вызова, а чтобы переместить пассажира на один этаж вверх или вниз, лифт тратит ровно 1 секунду. Посадка и высадка происходят мгновенно.

Помогите Эдварду найти минимальное время, за которое он сможет добраться до квартиры Наташи. Считайте, что Эдвард может выйти из подъезда только с первого этажа соответствующего подъезда (это происходит мгновенно). Если Эдвард стоит перед дверью какого-то подъезда, он может зайти в него и сразу окажется на первом этаже этого подъезда (это также происходит мгновенно). Эдвард может выбирать, в каком направлении идти вокруг дома.


-----Входные данные-----

В первой строке входных данных следуют три числа n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) — количество подъездов в доме, количество этажей в каждом подъезде и количество квартир на каждом этаже каждого подъезда соответственно.

Во второй строке входных данных записаны два числа a и b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k) — номера квартир, в которых живут Эдвард и Наташа, соответственно. Гарантируется, что эти номера различны. 


-----Выходные данные-----

Выведите единственное целое число — минимальное время (в секундах), за которое Эдвард сможет добраться от своей квартиры до квартиры Наташи.

Each of the employees belongs to one of two fractions: depublicans or remocrats, and these two fractions have opposite opinions on what should be the outcome of the vote. The voting procedure is rather complicated:   Each of n employees makes a statement. They make statements one by one starting from employees 1 and finishing with employee n. If at the moment when it's time for the i-th employee to make a statement he no longer has the right to vote, he just skips his turn (and no longer takes part in this voting).  When employee makes a statement, he can do nothing or declare that one of the other employees no longer has a right to vote. It's allowed to deny from voting people who already made the statement or people who are only waiting to do so. If someone is denied from voting he no longer participates in the voting till the very end.  When all employees are done with their statements, the procedure repeats: again, each employees starting from 1 and finishing with n who are still eligible to vote make their statements.  The process repeats until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining and he determines the outcome of the whole voting. Of course, he votes for the decision suitable for his fraction.

Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.

Serval will go to the bus station at time $t$, and there are $n$ bus routes which stop at this station. For the $i$-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time $s_i$ minutes, and each bus of this route comes $d_i$ minutes later than the previous one.

259,apps,gpt-4o,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,"It is raining heavily. But this is the first day for Serval, who just became 3 years old, to go to the kindergarten. Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.

Serval will go to the bus station at time $t$, and there are $n$ bus routes which stop at this station. For the $i$-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time $s_i$ minutes, and each bus of this route comes $d_i$ minutes later than the previous one.

As Serval's best friend, you wonder which bus route will he get on. If several buses arrive at the same time, you can print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $t$ ($1\leq n\leq 100$, $1\leq t\leq 10^5$) — the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. 

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two space-separated integers $s_i$ and $d_i$ ($1\leq s_i,d_i\leq 10^5$) — the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route.


-----Output-----

Print one number — what bus route Serval will use. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.


-----Examples-----

-----Note-----

In the first example, the first bus of the first route arrives at time $6$, and the first bus of the second route arrives at time $9$, so the first route is the answer.

In the second example, a bus of the third route arrives at time $5$, so it is the answer.

In the third example, buses of the first route come at times $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and so fourth, buses of the second route come at times $2$, $5$, $8$, and so fourth and buses of the third route come at times $2$, $6$, $10$, and so on, so $1$ and $2$ are both acceptable answers while $3$ is not.","# Function to find the bus route Serval will take

Они пронумерованы естественным образом от 1 до n·m·k, то есть первая квартира на первом этаже в первом подъезде имеет номер 1, первая квартира на втором этаже первого подъезда имеет номер k + 1 и так далее. Особенность этого дома состоит в том, что он круглый. То есть если обходить его по часовой стрелке, то после подъезда номер 1 следует подъезд номер 2, затем подъезд номер 3 и так далее до подъезда номер n. После подъезда номер n снова идёт подъезд номер 1.

Эдвард живёт в квартире номер a, а Наташа — в квартире номер b. Переход на 1 этаж вверх или вниз по лестнице занимает 5 секунд, переход от двери подъезда к двери соседнего подъезда — 15 секунд, а переход в пределах одного этажа одного подъезда происходит мгновенно. Также в каждом подъезде дома есть лифт. Он устроен следующим образом: он всегда приезжает ровно через 10 секунд после вызова, а чтобы переместить пассажира на один этаж вверх или вниз, лифт тратит ровно 1 секунду. Посадка и высадка происходят мгновенно.

Помогите Эдварду найти минимальное время, за которое он сможет добраться до квартиры Наташи. Считайте, что Эдвард может выйти из подъезда только с первого этажа соответствующего подъезда (это происходит мгновенно). Если Эдвард стоит перед дверью какого-то подъезда, он может зайти в него и сразу окажется на первом этаже этого подъезда (это также происходит мгновенно). Эдвард может выбирать, в каком направлении идти вокруг дома.


-----Входные данные-----

В первой строке входных данных следуют три числа n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) — количество подъездов в доме, количество этажей в каждом подъезде и количество квартир на каждом этаже каждого подъезда соответственно.

Во второй строке входных данных записаны два числа a и b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k) — номера квартир, в которых живут Эдвард и Наташа, соответственно. Гарантируется, что эти номера различны. 


-----Выходные данные-----

Выведите единственное целое число — минимальное время (в секундах), за которое Эдвард сможет добраться от своей квартиры до квартиры Наташи.

-----Примечание-----

В первом тестовом примере Эдвард находится в 4 подъезде на 10 этаже, а Наташа находится в 1 подъезде на 2 этаже. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно сначала спуститься на лифте на первый этаж (на это он потратит 19 секунд, из которых 10 — на ожидание и 9 — на поездку на лифте), затем обойти дом против часовой стрелки до подъезда номер 1 (на это он потратит 15 секунд), и наконец подняться по лестнице на этаж номер 2 (на это он потратит 5 секунд). Таким образом, ответ равен 19 + 15 + 5 = 39.

Во втором тестовом примере Эдвард живёт в подъезде 2 на этаже 1, а Наташа находится в подъезде 1 на этаже 1. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно просто обойти дом по часовой стрелке до подъезда 1, на это он потратит 15 секунд.","n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

106,apps,gpt-4o,gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,"Есть n-подъездный дом, в каждом подъезде по m этажей, и на каждом этаже каждого подъезда ровно k квартир. Таким образом, в доме всего n·m·k квартир. Они пронумерованы естественным образом от 1 до n·m·k, то есть первая квартира на первом этаже в первом подъезде имеет номер 1, первая квартира на втором этаже первого подъезда имеет номер k + 1 и так далее. Особенность этого дома состоит в том, что он круглый. То есть если обходить его по часовой стрелке, то после подъезда номер 1 следует подъезд номер 2, затем подъезд номер 3 и так далее до подъезда номер n. После подъезда номер n снова идёт подъезд номер 1.

Эдвард живёт в квартире номер a, а Наташа — в квартире номер b. Переход на 1 этаж вверх или вниз по лестнице занимает 5 секунд, переход от двери подъезда к двери соседнего подъезда — 15 секунд, а переход в пределах одного этажа одного подъезда происходит мгновенно. Также в каждом подъезде дома есть лифт. Он устроен следующим образом: он всегда приезжает ровно через 10 секунд после вызова, а чтобы переместить пассажира на один этаж вверх или вниз, лифт тратит ровно 1 секунду. Посадка и высадка происходят мгновенно.

Помогите Эдварду найти минимальное время, за которое он сможет добраться до квартиры Наташи. Считайте, что Эдвард может выйти из подъезда только с первого этажа соответствующего подъезда (это происходит мгновенно). Если Эдвард стоит перед дверью какого-то подъезда, он может зайти в него и сразу окажется на первом этаже этого подъезда (это также происходит мгновенно). Эдвард может выбирать, в каком направлении идти вокруг дома.


-----Входные данные-----

В первой строке входных данных следуют три числа n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) — количество подъездов в доме, количество этажей в каждом подъезде и количество квартир на каждом этаже каждого подъезда соответственно.

Во второй строке входных данных записаны два числа a и b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k) — номера квартир, в которых живут Эдвард и Наташа, соответственно. Гарантируется, что эти номера различны. 


-----Выходные данные-----

Выведите единственное целое число — минимальное время (в секундах), за которое Эдвард сможет добраться от своей квартиры до квартиры Наташи.

-----Примечание-----

В первом тестовом примере Эдвард находится в 4 подъезде на 10 этаже, а Наташа находится в 1 подъезде на 2 этаже. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно сначала спуститься на лифте на первый этаж (на это он потратит 19 секунд, из которых 10 — на ожидание и 9 — на поездку на лифте), затем обойти дом против часовой стрелки до подъезда номер 1 (на это он потратит 15 секунд), и наконец подняться по лестнице на этаж номер 2 (на это он потратит 5 секунд). Таким образом, ответ равен 19 + 15 + 5 = 39.

Во втором тестовом примере Эдвард живёт в подъезде 2 на этаже 1, а Наташа находится в подъезде 1 на этаже 1. Поэтому Эдварду выгодно просто обойти дом по часовой стрелке до подъезда 1, на это он потратит 15 секунд.","# Function to calculate minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment

Each of the employees belongs to one of two fractions: depublicans or remocrats, and these two fractions have opposite opinions on what should be the outcome of the vote. The voting procedure is rather complicated:   Each of n employees makes a statement. They make statements one by one starting from employees 1 and finishing with employee n. If at the moment when it's time for the i-th employee to make a statement he no longer has the right to vote, he just skips his turn (and no longer takes part in this voting).  When employee makes a statement, he can do nothing or declare that one of the other employees no longer has a right to vote. It's allowed to deny from voting people who already made the statement or people who are only waiting to do so. If someone is denied from voting he no longer participates in the voting till the very end.  When all employees are done with their statements, the procedure repeats: again, each employees starting from 1 and finishing with n who are still eligible to vote make their statements.  The process repeats until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining and he determines the outcome of the whole voting. Of course, he votes for the decision suitable for his fraction.
