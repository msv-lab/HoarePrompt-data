Example Answer:
`b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided using the values of `b`, `m`, and `k`. The previous values of `b`, `m`, and `k` are known, so the calculation can be done directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split operation, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from the split operation of the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated based on the provided formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split operation, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from the split operation of the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated based on the provided formula**
