Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split operation, `a`, `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from the split operation of the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated based on the provided formula, `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`, and the condition `(a_floor > b_floor)` is false. `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.**
