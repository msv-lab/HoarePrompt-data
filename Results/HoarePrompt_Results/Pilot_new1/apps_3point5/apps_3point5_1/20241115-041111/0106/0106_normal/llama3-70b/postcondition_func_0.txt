Functionality: The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the floor and block positions for `a` and `b`, determines the minimum time required to move between blocks and floors, and prints the sum of these times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value. The code accurately calculates the minimum time based on the floor and block positions of `a` and `b`.
