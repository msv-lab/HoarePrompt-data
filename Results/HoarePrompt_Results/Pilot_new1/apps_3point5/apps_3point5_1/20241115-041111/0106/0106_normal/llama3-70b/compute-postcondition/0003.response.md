Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `a`, `m`, and `k` are obtained from the input split operation, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split operation, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from the split operation of the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split operation, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values obtained from the split operation of the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described**
