Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. The floor value of `a` is greater than the floor value of `b`.***
