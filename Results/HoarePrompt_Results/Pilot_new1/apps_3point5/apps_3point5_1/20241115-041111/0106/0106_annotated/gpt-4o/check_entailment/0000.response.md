Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After carefully analyzing the code and the problem description, as well as considering the annotations provided, it can be concluded that the code correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The functions are designed to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given conditions. The `func_1` function handles the calculation of time considering the layout of the circular building, the elevator timings, and the walking distances. The `get_location` function correctly computes the block and floor values for a given apartment number. The code covers all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description, and there are no missing edge cases or logic gaps identified. Therefore, the correctness of the code is confirmed.
