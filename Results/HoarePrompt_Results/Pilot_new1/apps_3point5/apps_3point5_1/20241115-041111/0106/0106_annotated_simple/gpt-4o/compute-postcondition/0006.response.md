Postcondition: ***n, m, k, a, b are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k; block_a and floor_a are assigned based on the location of a; block_b and floor_b are assigned based on the location of b. If floor_a is equal to 1, then time_to_exit is 0. Otherwise, if floor_a is not equal to 1, time_to_exit is calculated as 10 + (floor_a - 1).***
