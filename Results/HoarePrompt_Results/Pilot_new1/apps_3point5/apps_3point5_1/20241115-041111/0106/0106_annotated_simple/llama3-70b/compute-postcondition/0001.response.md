Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split into integers using the `map` function. The values of `a` and `b` are obtained from the input, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split into integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split into integers**
