Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and simulates the voting process as described. It considers the indices of the employees and handles the cases where an employee is denied the right to vote. The program correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on the remaining employees in the queues. The code covers all possible scenarios and produces the correct output for the given inputs.
