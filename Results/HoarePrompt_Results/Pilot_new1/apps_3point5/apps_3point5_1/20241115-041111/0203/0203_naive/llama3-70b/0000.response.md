Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of depublicans and remocrats and then determines the outcome of the vote based on which fraction has more members. It follows the rules described in the problem statement where employees can deny others from voting until only one employee is left to vote. The logic of the program is sound and there are no cases provided where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
