Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input and a string of fractions. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the fractions string. If there are more 'D's than 'R's, it prints 'D'. Otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, it operates under the assumption that `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000, and the fractions string contains only 'D' or 'R' characters.
