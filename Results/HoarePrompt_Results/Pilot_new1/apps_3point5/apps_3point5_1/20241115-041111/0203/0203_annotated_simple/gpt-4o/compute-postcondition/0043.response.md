Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop will continuously pop elements from both queues, compare their values, and append new elements based on the comparison. If at any point either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty, an error will occur. The loop control variables `d_index` and `r_index` will hold the values of the popped elements. `d_queue` is empty, and the loop will not pop any elements from it.***
