Postcondition: ***`depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the loop has iterated through the fractions list incrementing either `depublicans` or `remocrats` based on the fraction values, and the final values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` are mutually exclusive based on the fraction values in the list. After execution, 'D' is printed. If `depublicans` is not greater than `remocrats`, then the values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` are either equal or `remocrats` is greater than `depublicans`. 'R' is printed.***
