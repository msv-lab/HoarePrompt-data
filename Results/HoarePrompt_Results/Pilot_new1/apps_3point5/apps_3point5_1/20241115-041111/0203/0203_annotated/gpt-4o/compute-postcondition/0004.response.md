According to the code, the loop can execute if the number of employees `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop iterates over the characters in the string `votes`, the loop can also execute if the string `votes` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `d_queue` and `r_queue` being empty does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `votes` is not empty, `i` is 0, and `v` is the first character in the `votes` string.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `votes` is not empty, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string**
