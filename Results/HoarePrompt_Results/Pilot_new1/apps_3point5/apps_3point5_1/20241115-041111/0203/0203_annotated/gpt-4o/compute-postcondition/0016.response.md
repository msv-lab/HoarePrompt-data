Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `r_queue`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `votes` has more elements, `d_queue` or `r_queue` is updated based on the next `v`, and `i` is appended accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `votes` has more elements, `d_queue` or `r_queue` is updated based on the next `v`, and `i` is appended accordingly**
