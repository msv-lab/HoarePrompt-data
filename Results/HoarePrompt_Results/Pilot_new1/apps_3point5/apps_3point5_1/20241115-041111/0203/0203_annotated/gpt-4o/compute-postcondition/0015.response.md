Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `d_queue` list. The previous state of `d_queue` is updated with the addition of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `votes` has more elements, `d_queue` is updated with the appended `i`, and `r_queue` remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `votes` has more elements, `d_queue` is updated with the appended `i`, `r_queue` remains the same**
