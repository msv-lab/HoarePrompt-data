Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string of votes. It processes the votes to determine the winning political faction based on the majority of votes. If there is a tie, it prints "Tie". The function creates two queues, `d_queue` for employees who voted 'D' and `r_queue` for employees who did not vote 'D'. It then simulates the voting process by updating the indices in the queues based on certain conditions. The final result is printed as 'D' if the `d_queue` is not empty, indicating a majority for 'D', and 'R' if the `d_queue` is empty, indicating a majority for 'R'.**
