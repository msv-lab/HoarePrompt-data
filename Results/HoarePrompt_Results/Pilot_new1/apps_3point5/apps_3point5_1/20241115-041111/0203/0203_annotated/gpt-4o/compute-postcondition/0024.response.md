Postcondition: ***If (d_index < r_index) is false, then n is greater than 0 and votes is not empty. d_queue contains indices of employees who voted 'D' except for the first one that was popped, r_queue contains indices of employees who did not vote 'D'. If n is 0 or votes is empty, both d_queue and r_queue are empty, and r_index is assigned the index popped from r_queue.***
