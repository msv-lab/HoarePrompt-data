Functionality: The function reads an integer n representing the number of employees and a string of length n containing 'D's and 'R's representing the political affiliation of each employee. It then counts the total number of Democrats and Republicans among the employees. Finally, it prints 'D' if there are more Democrats than Republicans, and 'R' if there are more or an equal number of Republicans compared to Democrats.
