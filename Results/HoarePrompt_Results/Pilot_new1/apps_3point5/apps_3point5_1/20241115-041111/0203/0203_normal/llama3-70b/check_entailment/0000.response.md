Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string `fractions` containing 'D's and 'R's representing the political affiliation of each employee.
- It then counts the total number of Democrats and Republicans among the employees.
- Finally, it prints 'D' if there are more Democrats than Republicans, and 'R' if there are more or an equal number of Republicans compared to Democrats.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case and the provided examples. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the described voting procedure and outcome based on the fractions of the employees.
