Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The initial state specifies that if `n` is at least 1, `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters and the index 'd_index + n' along with the newly appended index 'd_index + n'. Therefore, after executing the code, the new index 'd_index + n' will be added to `d_queue`.
Output State: **d_queue contains the indices of 'D' characters and the index 'd_index + n' along with the newly appended index 'd_index + n'**
