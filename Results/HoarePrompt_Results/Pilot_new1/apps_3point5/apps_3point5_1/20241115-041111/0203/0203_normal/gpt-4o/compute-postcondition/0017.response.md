Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character. If the next character in `votes` is 'D', `d_queue` contains the updated list of indices where 'D' characters were encountered, and `r_queue` is an empty list. If the next character in `votes` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains the index `i+1` and `d_queue` is an empty list.***
