Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from the d_queue and assigns it to d_index. If d_queue is not empty, d_index will contain the index of the 'D' character. If d_queue is empty, an error will occur. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **If n is at least 1, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters, r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty, and d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character.**
