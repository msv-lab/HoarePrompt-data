Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least two elements from list `a`, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is the first element in `assigned`. If the difference between the element at index 2 in list `a` and `x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
