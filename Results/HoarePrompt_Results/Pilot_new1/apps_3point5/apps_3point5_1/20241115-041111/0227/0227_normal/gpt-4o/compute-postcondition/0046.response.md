According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, if the difference condition was not met or if `assigned` had less than two elements, `can_form` remained False and `m` remained unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **If the difference condition was not met or if `assigned` had less than two elements, `can_form` remains False, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
