Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first and at least one more element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
