Output State: **If all elements in list `a` are twice the value of the previous element, then `m` will be equal to 1. If there is at least one element in list `a` that is not twice the value of the previous element, then `m` will be increased by the number of non-conforming elements. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute. The value of `m` is printed if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, -1 is printed.**
