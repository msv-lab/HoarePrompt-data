Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the new element `a[i+k]`, `m` is adjusted based on the condition, `i` is incremented by k. If `can_form` is False, it means there is no `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False, `m` is incremented by 1.***
