Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the new element `a[i]`, `m` is adjusted based on the condition, `i` is incremented by 1, `can_form` is set to True if the difference between `a[i]` and any element in `assigned` is found in `assigned`, `x` represents the current element in `assigned`. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False and the loop continues. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1.***
