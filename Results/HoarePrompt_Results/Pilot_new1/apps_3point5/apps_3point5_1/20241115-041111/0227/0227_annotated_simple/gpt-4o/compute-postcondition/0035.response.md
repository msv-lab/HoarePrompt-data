Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the new element `a[i+1]`, `m` is adjusted based on the condition, `i` is incremented by 1, `can_form` is set to True, `x` is the first element in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables and the loop continues.***
