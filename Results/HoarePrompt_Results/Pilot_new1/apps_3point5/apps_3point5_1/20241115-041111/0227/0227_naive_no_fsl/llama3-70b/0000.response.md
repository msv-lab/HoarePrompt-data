Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the sorted input sequence and checks if each element is double the previous element. If not, it increments the variable count. The program then prints the count if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
