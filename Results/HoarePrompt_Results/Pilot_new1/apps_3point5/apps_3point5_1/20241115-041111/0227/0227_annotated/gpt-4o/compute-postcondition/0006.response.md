According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `assigned`. Since `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, and `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, we can infer that `assigned` will not be empty. Therefore, the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False**
