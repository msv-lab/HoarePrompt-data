According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to n-1. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a` ensures that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
