Example Answer:
The element at index `i + 3` in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, but there is no information about the values of `i`, `a`, or `assigned`. `can_form` remains True, `m` is further incremented by 1, and `assigned` continues to be non-empty. Therefore, the Output State is: The element at index `i + 3` in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `can_form` remains True, `m` is further incremented by 1, `assigned` continues to be non-empty.
Output State: **The element at index `i + 3` in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `can_form` remains True, `m` is further incremented by 1, `assigned` continues to be non-empty**
