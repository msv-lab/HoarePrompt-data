Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the balance of the input string $s$ and then determines the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ based on the given conditions. It covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, including cases where there might be an infinite number of prefixes. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output for each test case.
