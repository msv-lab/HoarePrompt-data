According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, the values of `n`, `x`, and `s` at the new indices in the `data` list need to be assigned. The `prefix_balances` at index `i` needs to be updated according to the given formula.
State: **`n`, `x`, and `s` are assigned the integer values at the new indices in the `data` list, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
