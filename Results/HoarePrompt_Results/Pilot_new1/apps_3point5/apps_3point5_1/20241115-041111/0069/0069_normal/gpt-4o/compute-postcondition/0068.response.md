Postcondition: ***`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied. All initial conditions are retained, and the count variable is increased by 1 if the specified condition is met.***
