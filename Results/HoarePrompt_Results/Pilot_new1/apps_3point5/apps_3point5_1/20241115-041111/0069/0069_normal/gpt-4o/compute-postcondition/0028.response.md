According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `balance` is not equal to 0 implies that the loop will execute, `count` being 0 does not affect the loop execution. After the loop execution, `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative sum based on the formula provided. So, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0, `balance` should not be 0, and `prefix_balances` should be updated according to the formula provided. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is updated based on the formula provided**
