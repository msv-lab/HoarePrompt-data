Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once and update `prefix_balances` based on the formula provided. After the loop execution, `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding element in `s` is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index `n`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s. `balance` is not equal to 0.***
