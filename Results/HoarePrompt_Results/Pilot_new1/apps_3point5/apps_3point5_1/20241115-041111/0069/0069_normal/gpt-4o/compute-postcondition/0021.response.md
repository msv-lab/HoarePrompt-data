Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding element in `s` is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index `n` and `balance` is 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` will remain a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s and `balance` is 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `x` is in `prefix_balances`.***
