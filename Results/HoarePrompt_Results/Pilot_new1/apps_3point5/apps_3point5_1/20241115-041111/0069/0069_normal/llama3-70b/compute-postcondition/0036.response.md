Output State: 
- If T is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. 
- After each iteration, n and x are assigned values based on the input. 
- The string s is read as input, and cnt0 and cnt1 are calculated as the counts of '0' and '1' in s, respectively. 
- The balance is computed as the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. 
- If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. 
- If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, the program prints -1. 
- Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). 
- The loop handles all scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correct output based on the conditions. 
- If T is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and no values are assigned to n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, or balance. 
- The program does not produce any output in this case.
