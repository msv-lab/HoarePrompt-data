Output State: `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 11` in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 12, `balance` is calculated, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `prefix_balances` is updated based on the formula `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1` with the new values calculated for each index `i`.
