Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is an integer. The value of `index` determines which element of the list `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `index`, `balance`, `prefix_balances`, `n`, `results`, `x`, and `count` are in their updated states according to the conditions mentioned in the program fragment.
Output State: **`s`, `index`, `balance`, `prefix_balances`, `n`, `results`, `x`, and `count` are in their updated states according to the conditions mentioned in the program fragment**
