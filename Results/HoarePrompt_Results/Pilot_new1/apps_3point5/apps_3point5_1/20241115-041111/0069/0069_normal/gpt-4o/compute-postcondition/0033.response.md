Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` will be incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` has more elements, and `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` has more elements, `count` is incremented by 1**
