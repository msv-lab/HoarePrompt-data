Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list containing input values, `index` is 1, and `int` converts the value at index 1 of `data` to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `data` is a list containing the input values, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from the input data at index 1.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the input values, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from the input data at index 1**
