Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` has more elements, `count` may be incremented. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is incremented by 1. The state of the variables after the execution of the if statement covers all edge cases where the specified condition holds true, ensuring that `count` reflects the number of times the condition was met.***
