Output State: **`n` is an integer value extracted from `data[index]`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the calculation `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
