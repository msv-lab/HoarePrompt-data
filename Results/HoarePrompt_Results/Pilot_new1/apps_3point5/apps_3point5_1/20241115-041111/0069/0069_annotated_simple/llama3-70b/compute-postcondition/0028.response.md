Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in the input string `s`. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: T + 1, n is assigned the first value from input().split(), x is assigned the second value from input().split(), s is the input string, cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' in the input string.
Output State: **T + 1, n is assigned the first value from input().split(), x is assigned the second value from input().split(), s is the input string, cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' in the input string**
