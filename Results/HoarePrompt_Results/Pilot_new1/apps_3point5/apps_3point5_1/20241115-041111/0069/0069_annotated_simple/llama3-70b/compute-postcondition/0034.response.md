Postcondition: ***T + 1, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, balance are assigned values from input().split() and the input string. If balance equals x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. The program handles all cases involving the counts of '0' and '1' in the input string, as well as the balance between them, ensuring that the appropriate output is printed based on the calculated values.***
