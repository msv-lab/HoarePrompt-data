Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer that is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged. `prefix_balances` still has more elements. `b`, `x`, and `balance` remain unchanged. The condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, leading to the increment of `count` by 1.***
