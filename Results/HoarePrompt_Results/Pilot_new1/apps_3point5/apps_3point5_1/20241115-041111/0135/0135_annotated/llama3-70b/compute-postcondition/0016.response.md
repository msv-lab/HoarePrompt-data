Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, but the previous values of `n`, `i+1`, and `seen` are unknown. Since `remainder` is not in `seen`, it is added to `seen`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `i+1` are integers based on user input, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the result of `n % (i+1)` and is not in `seen`, `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `i+1` are integers based on user input, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the result of `n % (i+1)` and is not in `seen`, `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`**
