Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers n and k as input, then iterates from 1 to k calculating the remainder of n divided by i. If a previously calculated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The code ensures that all remainders are distinct as required by the problem description. The annotations also accurately describe the functionality of the code, explaining the purpose of the loop and the use of the set to keep track of seen remainders. The code covers all potential cases and aligns with the problem description.
