Output State: **If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If n is 0, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop checks if the remainder of n divided by i is already in seen_remainders. If it is, the program returns 'No'. If not, the loop adds the current remainder to seen_remainders and continues to the next iteration.**
