Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `seen_remainders` is a set containing the current `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is a set containing the current `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
