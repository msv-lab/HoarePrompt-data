According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`seen_remainders` is a set containing the current `remainder`, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
