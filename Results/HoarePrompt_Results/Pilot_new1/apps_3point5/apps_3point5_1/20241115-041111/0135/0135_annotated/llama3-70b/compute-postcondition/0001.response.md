Example Answer:
The set `seen` is initialized as an empty set. The variables `n` and `k` are integers based on user input, but their values are unknown at this point. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers based on user input, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers based on user input, `seen` is an empty set**
