According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 1 which is 0, `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`**
