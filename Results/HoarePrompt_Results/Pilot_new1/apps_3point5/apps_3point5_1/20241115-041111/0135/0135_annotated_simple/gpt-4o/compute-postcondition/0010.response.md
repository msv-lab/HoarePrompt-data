Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and `i` is 2, the value of `remainder` will be either 0 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 2, remainder is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 2, remainder is either 0 or 1**
