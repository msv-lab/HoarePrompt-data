According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 4, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 2, `remainder` is assigned the value of n % i, `seen` contains the updated set of values after adding `remainder`**
