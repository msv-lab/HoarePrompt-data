The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.

Case 2: If k is less than n, the loop iterates from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop continues until k is reached. After the loop executes, n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = k, remainder is either 0 or 1.

Case 3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` within the specified constraints and return 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n, return 'No' if any remainder is repeated during the loop iteration, and return 'Yes' otherwise.
