According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k); `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by `i`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k), which means `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k) + 1; `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by `i`**
