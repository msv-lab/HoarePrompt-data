Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles the condition of checking if all remainders are distinct and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
