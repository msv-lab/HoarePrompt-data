According to the code, the loop will execute k times where k is a positive integer. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer and `k` is also a positive integer. To ensure the loop executes, `n` should remain as a positive integer, `k` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1, and `seen` should remain as an empty set.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set**
