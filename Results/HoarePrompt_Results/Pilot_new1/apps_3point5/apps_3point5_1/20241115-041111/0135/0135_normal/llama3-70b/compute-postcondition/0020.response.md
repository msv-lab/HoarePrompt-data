Example Answer:
`remainder` is calculated as the result of n modulo (k + 1). If the remainder is not in the set `seen`, it is added to the set. If it is already in the set, then 'No' is printed and the program exits. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is updated with the remainder of n divided by (k + 1), `remainder` is the result of n modulo (k + 1).
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is updated with the remainder of n divided by (k + 1), `remainder` is the result of n modulo (k + 1)**
