According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `seen` is updated by adding the remainder of n divided by the last `i` value. If the remainder of n is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next `i` value to be considered in the loop will be `k + 1`. Therefore, the updated state should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is updated by adding the remainder of n divided by `k + 1`**
