Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is a list containing tuples `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers from the input split. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.**
