Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are integers from the input split. The previous state of `buses` is a list containing tuples. After the execution, a new tuple `(s, d)` is added to the `buses` list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is a list containing tuples `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers from the input split**
