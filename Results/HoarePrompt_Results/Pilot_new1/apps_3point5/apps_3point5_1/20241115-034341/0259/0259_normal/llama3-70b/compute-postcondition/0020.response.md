Postcondition: ***`min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `buses` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first element in the list, `time` is calculated based on the values of `t`, `s`, and `d. If the calculated `time` is less than the current `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time` and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`.***
