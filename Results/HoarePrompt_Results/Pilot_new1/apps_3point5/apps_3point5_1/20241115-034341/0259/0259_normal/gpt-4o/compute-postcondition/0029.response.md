Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is the starting time of the bus route `i`, and `t` is a given time value. The values of `s_i` and `t` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `wait_time` cannot be determined. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `n` is increased by 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `n` is increased by 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`**
