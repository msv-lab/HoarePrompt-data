Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `time` and the previous `min_time`. `ans` is updated to the value of `i + 1`. The list `buses` remains unchanged with at least 2 elements. `i` is incremented by 1. `s` and `d` are the values of the next element in the list. `time` is recalculated as `(t - s) % d`. Additionally, `ans` is always incremented by 1 after the if statement.***
