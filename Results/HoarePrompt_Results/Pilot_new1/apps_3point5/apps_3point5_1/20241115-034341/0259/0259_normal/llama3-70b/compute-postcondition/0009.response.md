Example Answer:
The variables `s` and `d` are assigned the integers obtained from splitting the input. The previous values of `s` and `d` are unknown, so after execution, the values of `s` and `d` are determined by the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is a list containing tuples `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers from the input split.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is a list containing tuples `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers from the input split**
