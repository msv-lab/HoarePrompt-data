Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes. `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the selected bus route. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, and `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the if statement executes, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum `wait_time` value, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` where `i` is the index of the selected bus route with the minimum wait time.***
