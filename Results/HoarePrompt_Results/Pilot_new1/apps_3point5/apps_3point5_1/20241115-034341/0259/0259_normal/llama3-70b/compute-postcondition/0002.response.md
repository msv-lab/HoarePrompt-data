According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is within the range of 1 to 100. Since `buses` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. The variable `t` being a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 does not impact the loop execution. Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is an empty list**
