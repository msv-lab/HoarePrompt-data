Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[i][0]`, and `d_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[i][1]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This covers all possible scenarios for the calculation of `wait_time` based on the conditions provided in the if else block.***
