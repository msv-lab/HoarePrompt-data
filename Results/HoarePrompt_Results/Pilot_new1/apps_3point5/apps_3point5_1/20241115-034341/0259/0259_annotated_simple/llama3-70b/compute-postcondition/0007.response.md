Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are integers. The list `buses` now contains 'bus1' and the newly added tuple `(s, d)`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains 'bus1' and an additional tuple `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers**
