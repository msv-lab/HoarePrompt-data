Example Answer: 
`s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`, where `bus_routes[i]` is a tuple containing two values. The previous values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`**
