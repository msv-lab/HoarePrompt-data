Output State: **`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is updated to be equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios of the program fragment. Additionally, the `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`**
