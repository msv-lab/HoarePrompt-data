According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` are positive integers. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. Update `n` to ensure that `i` is less than the updated `n`.
2. Update `t` to maintain the positivity of the integer.
3. Update the values of `s_i` and `d_i` based on the tuple at index `i`.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`**
