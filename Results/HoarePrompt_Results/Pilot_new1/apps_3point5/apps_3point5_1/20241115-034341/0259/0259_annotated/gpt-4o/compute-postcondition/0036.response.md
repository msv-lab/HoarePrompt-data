Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`, `i` is less than `n`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the execution of the if statement, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `wait_time` and the previous `min_wait_time`. `chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1` corresponding to the index of the chosen route. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios including edge cases and boundary values where the values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are determined based on the conditions provided in the program fragment.***
