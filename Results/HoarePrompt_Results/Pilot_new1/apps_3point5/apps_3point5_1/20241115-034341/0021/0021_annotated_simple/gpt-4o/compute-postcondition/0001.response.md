Example Answer:
The list `a` is reassigned by mapping the input to integers and splitting the input. The list `a` now contains n distinct integers from 1 to n based on the input. The value of `n` is an input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n**
