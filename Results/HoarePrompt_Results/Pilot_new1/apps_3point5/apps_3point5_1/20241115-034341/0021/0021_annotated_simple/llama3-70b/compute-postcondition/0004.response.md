Example Answer:
The maximum distance `max_dist` is calculated by taking the maximum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1 and `n` minus 2. The previous values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `max_dist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`**
