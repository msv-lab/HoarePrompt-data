Example Answer:
The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the element 1 in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and the index of 1 in a list starting from 1 is 0, `pos1` will be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0**
