Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values entered through input after converting them into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values in the list `a` are distinct integers from 1 to n where 2 <= n <= 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n**
