The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the preconditions that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n). The function does not return any value, but it performs certain operations or calculations based on the input parameters `n` and `a`.
