Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition states that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Therefore, the output state is: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n**.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n**
