According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[1]`, `i` is 2. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **N is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[1]`, `i` is 3**
