According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` ranges from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` are integers. If `gcd % i == 0`, `max_divisor` is updated based on certain conditions. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range. 
State: **`max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` are integers.**
