Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. Since the initial state of `max_divisor` and `i` are integers, the value of `max_divisor` after execution will be the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `i`. The value of `gcd` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is an integer with the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `i`, `gcd` is an integer, `i` is an integer.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is an integer with the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `i`, `gcd` is an integer, `i` is an integer**
