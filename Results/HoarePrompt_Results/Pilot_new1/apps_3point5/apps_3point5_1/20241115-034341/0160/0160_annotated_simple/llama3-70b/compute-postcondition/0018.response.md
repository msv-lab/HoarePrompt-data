Postcondition: ***max_divisor and gcd are integers, gcd is greater than or equal to 1, i is an integer that ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)). If gcd % i == 0, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the previous max_divisor and gcd // i, where i is an integer and the square of i is not equal to gcd. This update occurs if i * i is not equal to gcd. If i * i is equal to gcd, max_divisor remains unchanged. All possible cases, including edge cases, are handled in the postcondition.***
