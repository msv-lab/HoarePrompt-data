Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` starts at 1 and `x` is divisible by `i`, the first value added to `divisors` will be 1. The set `divisors` will now contain 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing 1, x is a positive integer, i is 1, math module is imported, x is divisible by i.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing 1, x is a positive integer, i is 1, math module is imported, x is divisible by i**
