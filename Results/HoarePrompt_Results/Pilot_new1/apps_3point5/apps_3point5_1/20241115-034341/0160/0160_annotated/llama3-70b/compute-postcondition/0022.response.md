Postcondition: ***`gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `i` is incremented by 1. If i * i is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.***
