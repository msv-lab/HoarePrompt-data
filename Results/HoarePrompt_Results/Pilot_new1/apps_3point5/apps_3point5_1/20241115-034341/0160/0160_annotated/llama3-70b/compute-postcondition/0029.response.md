According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated to capture the maximum divisor found so far, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `gcd % i == 0`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. Additionally, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1.

State: **`gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` captures the maximum divisor of `gcd` excluding the square root of `gcd`, `i` is incremented by 1**
