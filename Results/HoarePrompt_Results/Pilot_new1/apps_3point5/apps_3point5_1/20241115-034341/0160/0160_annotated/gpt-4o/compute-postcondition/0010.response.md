According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 because `3` is less than the square root of `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing 1 and additional divisors of x, x is a positive integer, i is 3, math module is imported**
