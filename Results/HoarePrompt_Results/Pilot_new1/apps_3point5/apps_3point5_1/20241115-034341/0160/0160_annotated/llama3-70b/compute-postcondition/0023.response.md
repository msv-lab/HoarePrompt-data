Postcondition: ***`gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `gcd % i == 0`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. If `i * i != gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.***
