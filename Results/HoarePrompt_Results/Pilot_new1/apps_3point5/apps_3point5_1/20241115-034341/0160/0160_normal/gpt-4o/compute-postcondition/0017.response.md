The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer. The constraints for `x` are that 2 <= x <= 500. After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted list of divisors of `x` in descending order. The divisors will be integers that divide `x` without leaving a remainder.
