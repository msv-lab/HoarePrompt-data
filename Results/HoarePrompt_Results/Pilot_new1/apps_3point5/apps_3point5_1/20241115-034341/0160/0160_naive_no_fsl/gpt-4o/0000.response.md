Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input of N, K, and the list of integers A.
2. It calculates the sum of elements in list A.
3. The program defines two functions, func_1 to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of numbers, and func_2 to find all the divisors of a given number.
4. It calculates the gcd of the list A and finds all the divisors of the sum of elements in A.
5. It then iterates over the divisors and checks if each divisor can divide every element of A after the operations. If it can, it prints the divisor and breaks the loop.
6. The program follows the problem description and logic provided to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases.
