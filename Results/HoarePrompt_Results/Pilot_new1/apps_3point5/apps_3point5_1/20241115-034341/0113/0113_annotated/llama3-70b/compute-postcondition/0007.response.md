According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `n % x != 0` is satisfied. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is increased by 3, `k` remains the same, and `x` remains the same. For the loop to execute one more time, `n % x` should still not be equal to 0. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being increased by 3.
State: **`n` is increased by 3, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same, and the condition `n % x != 0` is satisfied**
