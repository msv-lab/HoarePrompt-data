Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated by multiplying `n` with the result of `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. Since `multiplier` is defined as `10` raised to the power of `k`, and `k` is a non-negative integer, the value of `multiplier` is `10^k`. The `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. Therefore, the value of `x` is determined by this calculation. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `multiplier` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, `x` is the result of the calculation n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))**
