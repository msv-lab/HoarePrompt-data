Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the k-rounding of n by incrementing n until it is divisible by 10^k. This logic covers all potential cases as it ensures that the resulting number ends with k or more zeros and is divisible by n. The program will work for all valid input values of n and k.
