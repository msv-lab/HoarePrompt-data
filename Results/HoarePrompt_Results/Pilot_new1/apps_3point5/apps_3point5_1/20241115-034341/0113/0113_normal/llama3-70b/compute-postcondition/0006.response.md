Example Answer:
`n` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `n` will be the previous value + 1. The other variables `k` and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer incremented by 5, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, `x` is recalculated based on the new value of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 5, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, `x` is recalculated based on the new value of `k`**
