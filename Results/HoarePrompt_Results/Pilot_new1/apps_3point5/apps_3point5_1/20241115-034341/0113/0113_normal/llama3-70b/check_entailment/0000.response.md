Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the problem description for all potential cases. For example, if n is already divisible by 10^k, the code will unnecessarily increment n until it is divisible by 10^k again, leading to incorrect output. The code should check if n is already divisible by 10^k and handle this case separately to ensure correctness.
