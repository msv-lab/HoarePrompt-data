Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the k-rounding of a given positive integer n as described in the problem statement. The function func_1 calculates the value of x using the formula n * (10^k // gcd(n, 10^k)), where gcd represents the greatest common divisor. This formula ensures that x ends with k or more zeros and is divisible by n.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the k-rounding for any given input values of n and k. The output produced by the code aligns with the expected output based on the problem description.

Therefore, based on the code logic and the problem description, the correctness of the program is True.
