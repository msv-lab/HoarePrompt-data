Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts two inputs separated by a space and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `n` and `k` are updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
