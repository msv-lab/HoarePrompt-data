Example Answer:
`multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` can be any value between 0 and 8. The value of `k` determines the value of `multiplier`, which is calculated as 10 to the power of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `multiplier` is calculated based on the value of `k`.
Output State: **`multiplier` is calculated based on the value of `k`**
