Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` correctly handles the scenarios where the input number `n` falls within the ranges specified in the problem description. The conditions for returning the string representations of numbers from 0 to 9, 11 to 19, and 10 to 99 are implemented correctly. The code also correctly concatenates the string representations of the tens and ones places with a hyphen when needed. Additionally, the output hints align with the code and confirm that the function behaves as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the code can be considered correct.
