Postcondition: ***`ones`, `teens`, `tens` contain strings representing numbers from zero to ninety. The value of `n` is between 10 and 99, excluding the range of 11 to 19. If `n` is divisible by 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` with a hyphen and the string representing the ones place of `n`.***
