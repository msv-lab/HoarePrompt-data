The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the 'ones' list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the 'teens' list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, excluding the range of 11 to 19, the function checks if `n` is divisible by 10. If `n` is divisible by 10, it returns the string representing the tens place of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` with a hyphen and the string representing the ones place of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return the appropriate string representation based on the rules described above. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns the string representation based on the specified conditions.**
