Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the number of bourles you hold.
2. It then reads the prices at which shares can be bought and sold and sorts them in ascending and descending order respectively.
3. The program iterates through the buying opportunities and buys as many shares as possible until the remaining bourles are not enough to buy more shares.
4. It then iterates through the selling opportunities and sells all the bought shares at the highest possible price.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening, which is the correct output based on the problem description.
6. The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
