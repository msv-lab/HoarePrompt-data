Output State: **n, m, r are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. s is a list containing the integers entered by the user, b is a list containing the integers entered by the user after converting them to integers. min_buy_price is the minimum value in the list s, max_sell_price is the maximum value in list b. max_shares is calculated as the floor division of r by min_buy_price. remaining_bourles is the remainder of dividing r by min_buy_price. total_bourles is calculated as max_shares multiplied by max_sell_price plus remaining_bourles. The total_bourles value is printed.**
