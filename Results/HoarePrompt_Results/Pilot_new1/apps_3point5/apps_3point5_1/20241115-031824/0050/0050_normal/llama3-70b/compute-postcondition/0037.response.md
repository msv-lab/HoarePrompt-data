According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. 
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` is 2**
