Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. `s` is a list containing the integers entered by the user, `b` is a list containing the integers entered by the user after converting them to integers. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, the program prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, the program calculates `max_shares` as the floor division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as the sum of `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` and `remaining_bourles`, then prints `total_bourles`.***
