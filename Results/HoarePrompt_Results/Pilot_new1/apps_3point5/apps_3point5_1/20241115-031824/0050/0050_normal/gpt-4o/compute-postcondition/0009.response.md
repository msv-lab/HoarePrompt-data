Output State: **n, m, r are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. s is a list containing the integers entered by the user, b is a list containing the integers entered by the user after converting them to integers. min_buy_price is the minimum value in the list s, max_sell_price is the maximum value in list b. The maximum sell price is greater than the minimum buy price. max_shares is calculated as the floor division of r by min_buy_price. remaining_bourles is the remainder of dividing r by min_buy_price.**
