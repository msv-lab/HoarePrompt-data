Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list containing integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input after splitting; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. The maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price***
