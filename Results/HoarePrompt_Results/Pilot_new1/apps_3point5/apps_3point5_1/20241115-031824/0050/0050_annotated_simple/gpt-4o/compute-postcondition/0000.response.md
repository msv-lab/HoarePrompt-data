Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000**
