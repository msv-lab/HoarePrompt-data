Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `b` is not empty, `r` is positive and not less than the first element of `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` retains its initial value. If shares > 0, `r` is updated by adding shares multiplied by the element at index `i` in `b`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, if shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
