Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], `shares` is increased by the floor division of r by s[i], and r is updated to the remainder of dividing r by s[i]. If r is less than s[i], the loop is exited.***
