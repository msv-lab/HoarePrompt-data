Example Answer:
`total_bourles` is calculated by multiplying `max_shares` with `max_sell_price` and adding `remaining_bourles`. `max_shares` is calculated by dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`. Therefore, `total_bourles` is the total amount of money obtained from selling the maximum number of shares at the maximum selling price and adding the remaining money from the initial investment. 
Output State: **`total_bourles` is the total amount of money obtained from selling shares and adding remaining money**
