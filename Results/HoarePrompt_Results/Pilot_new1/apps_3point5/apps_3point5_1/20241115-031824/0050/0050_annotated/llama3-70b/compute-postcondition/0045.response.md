The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the sum of the products of two lists `s` and `b`, where the lists `s` and `b` are generated based on the constraints and relationships between the input parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, `s_i`, and `b_i`. The function calculates the sum of the products of corresponding elements in the lists `s` and `b` and returns the final sum value.
