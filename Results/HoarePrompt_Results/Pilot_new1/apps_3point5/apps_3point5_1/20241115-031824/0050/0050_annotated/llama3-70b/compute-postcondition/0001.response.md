Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
