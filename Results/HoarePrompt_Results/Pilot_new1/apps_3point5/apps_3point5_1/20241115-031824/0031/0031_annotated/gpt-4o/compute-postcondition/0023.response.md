Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000003, `total_days` remains 1 << n, `numerator` contains the result of the product of (total_days - i) for each iteration modulo MOD, `denominator` contains the result of the product of total_days for each iteration modulo MOD, `k` is 0 or negative, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.**
