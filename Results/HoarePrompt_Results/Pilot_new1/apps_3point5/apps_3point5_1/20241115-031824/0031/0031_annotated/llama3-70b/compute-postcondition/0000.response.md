Example Answer:
The value of `total_days` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` can be any integer between 1 and 10^18, the value of `total_days` can vary greatly. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`.
Output State: **`total_days` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`**
