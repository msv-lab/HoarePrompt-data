Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland. It handles the edge cases where k is greater than 2^n and when k is equal to 1. The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure that the output is within the specified limits. The gcd function is used to find the greatest common divisor of A and B before taking the remainder modulo 10^6 + 3. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
