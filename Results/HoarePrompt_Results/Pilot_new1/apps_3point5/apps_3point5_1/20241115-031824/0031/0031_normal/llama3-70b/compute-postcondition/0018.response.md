The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns the remainders of the numerator and denominator after dividing by 10^6 + 3. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the remainders of the numerator and denominator after dividing by 10^6 + 3.
