Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers n and k as input, representing the number of days in a year and the number of people to be interviewed, respectively.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days by computing the numerator and denominator as described in the problem statement.
- The code then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator, divides both by the gcd, and returns the remainders of the numerator and denominator after dividing by 10^6 + 3.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, providing a clear explanation of how the probability is calculated and what the function `func_1` does.
- There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or the output hints that are not handled by the code, and all examples provided in the description are correctly calculated by the code.
