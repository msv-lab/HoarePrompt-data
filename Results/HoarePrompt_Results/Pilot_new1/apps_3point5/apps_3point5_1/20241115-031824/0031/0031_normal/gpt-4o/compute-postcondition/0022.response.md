Example Answer: 
`A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `p_shared` is calculated using the provided formula. The previous values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and `p_shared` are not provided, so the exact values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator, and `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator, and `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`**
