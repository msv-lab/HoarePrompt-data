Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is multiplied by the difference between `total_days` and `i`. The values of `total_days` and `i` are not provided, so the output state is: n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is updated based on the calculation, denominator is 1, i is 0.
Output State: **n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is updated based on the calculation, denominator is 1, i is 0**
