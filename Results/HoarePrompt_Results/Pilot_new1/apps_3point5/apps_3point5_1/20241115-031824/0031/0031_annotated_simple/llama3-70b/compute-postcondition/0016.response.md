Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is divided by `gcd` using the floor division assignment operator. The previous value of `denominator` is divided by the value of `gcd`. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator is divided by gcd, `denominator` is updated after floor division by `gcd`.
Output State: **numerator is divided by gcd, `denominator` is updated after floor division by `gcd`**
