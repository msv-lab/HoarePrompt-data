Output State: **numerator is the result of the product of (total_days - k) to (total_days - 1) modulo MOD, denominator is the result of the product of 1 to k modulo MOD, MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, i is k-1, k is greater than or equal to 0. If k is 0, the loop does not execute and numerator and denominator remain 1; p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator, p_total is assigned the value of denominator, p_shared is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, A is assigned the value of p_shared**
