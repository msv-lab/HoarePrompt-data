Example Answer:
`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, but the previous values of `numerator` and other variables are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: numerator is the result of the product of (total_days - k) to (total_days - 1) modulo MOD, denominator is the result of the product of 1 to k modulo MOD, MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, i is k-1, k is greater than or equal to 0. If k is 0, the loop does not execute and numerator and denominator remain 1; `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`.
