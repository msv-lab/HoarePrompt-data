According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total_days is 1 shifted left by n does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
