Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and taking the modulo by `MOD`. Since the initial value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, the new value of `denominator` will be 2^n % MOD. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is updated value, denominator is 2^n % MOD, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is updated value, denominator is 2^n % MOD, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
