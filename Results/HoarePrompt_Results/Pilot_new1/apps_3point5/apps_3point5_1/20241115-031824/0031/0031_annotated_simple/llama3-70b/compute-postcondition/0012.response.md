According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is `(total_days - (2+1)) * (total_days - 2) * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days` multiplied by `total_days` squared, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is `(total_days - (2+1)) * (total_days - 2) * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days` multiplied by `total_days` squared, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3**
