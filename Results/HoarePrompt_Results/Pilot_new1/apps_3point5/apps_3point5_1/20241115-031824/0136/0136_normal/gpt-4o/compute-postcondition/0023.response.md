Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`. In case `a` and `b` are initially empty strings, they are updated to '0'.***
