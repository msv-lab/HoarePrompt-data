Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two non-negative integers as strings, possibly with leading zeros.
- It then compares the two numbers by first removing any leading zeros and then comparing their lengths. If the lengths are not equal, it directly compares the lengths and prints '<' or '>'.
- If the lengths are equal, it compares the actual numerical values of the strings and prints '<', '>', or '=' accordingly.
- The code handles cases where the numbers are equal, one number is smaller, or one number is larger accurately.
- The code also accounts for cases where the numbers have leading zeros and handles them appropriately.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case provided in the examples.
