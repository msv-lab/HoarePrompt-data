Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two non-negative integers represented as strings, strips leading zeros from both, compares them, and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first integer is less than the second, and '>' if the first integer is greater than the second. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the expected behavior. The code handles the input correctly and produces the expected output for the given examples.
