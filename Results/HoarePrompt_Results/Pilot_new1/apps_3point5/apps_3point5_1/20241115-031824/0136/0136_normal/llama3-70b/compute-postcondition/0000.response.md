Example Answer:
The input is accepted as a string and leading zeros are stripped from the string. The variable `a` is assigned the modified string value. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros stripped, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros stripped, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
