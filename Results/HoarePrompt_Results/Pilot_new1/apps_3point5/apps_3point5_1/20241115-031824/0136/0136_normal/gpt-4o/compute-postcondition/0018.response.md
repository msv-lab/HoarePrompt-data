Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, updated to '0' if initially empty. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed, updated to '0' if initially empty. The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is greater than `b`.***
