The function `func_1` reads two strings as input, representing non-negative integers possibly with leading zeros. It then compares the two numbers and prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>', if the first number is greater than the second, or '=' if they are equal. The comparison takes into account the actual numerical values of the strings, considering their lengths if the values are equal. The function does not explicitly return any value.
