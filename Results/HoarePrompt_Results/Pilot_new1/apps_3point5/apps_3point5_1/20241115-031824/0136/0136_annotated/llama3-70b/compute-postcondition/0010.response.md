Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. The program successfully handles all cases where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings and `a` is not equal to `b`.***
