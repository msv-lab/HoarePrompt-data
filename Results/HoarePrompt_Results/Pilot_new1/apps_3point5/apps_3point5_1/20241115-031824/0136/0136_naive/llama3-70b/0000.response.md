Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads two non-negative integers a and b, removes leading zeroes, and then compares them. The comparison is done correctly based on the problem description, printing "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b. The program handles cases where a and b have leading zeroes and ensures that the comparison is made without those leading zeroes affecting the result. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
