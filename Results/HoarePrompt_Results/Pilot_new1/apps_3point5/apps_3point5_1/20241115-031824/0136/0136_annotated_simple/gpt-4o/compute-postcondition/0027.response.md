Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data, removes leading zeros from two elements, `a` and `b`, compares their lengths, and then compares the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. The program handles cases where `a` and `b` can be empty strings or have different lengths to ensure correct comparison and output. However, the function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
