Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of `x` and `y` are constrained by the precondition, so after execution, `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
