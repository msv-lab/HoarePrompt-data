Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program takes the input values of x and y, then calculates the absolute difference between them using the `abs()` function and prints the result. This logic is correct as the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from x is simply the absolute difference between x and y. The program satisfies the problem description for all potential cases and therefore is correct.
