Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using the `abs()` function. Since `x` and `y` are integers with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result of `abs(x - y)` will always be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between x and y is printed.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between x and y is printed**
