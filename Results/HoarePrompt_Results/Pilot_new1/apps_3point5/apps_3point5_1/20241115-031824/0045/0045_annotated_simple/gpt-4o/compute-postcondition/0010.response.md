Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10, and `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula. `i` is `k - 1`. If the remainder is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables retain their initial conditions and constraints.***
