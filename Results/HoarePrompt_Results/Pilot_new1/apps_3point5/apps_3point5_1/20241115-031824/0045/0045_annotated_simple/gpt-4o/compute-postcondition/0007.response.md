According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `min_sum` are not directly related to the loop execution, but they are positive integers. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` and `k` should remain positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and `min_sum` is calculated based on the provided formula. Additionally, `i` should be set to `k - 1` to ensure the loop starts from the correct index.
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula, `i` is `k - 1`**
