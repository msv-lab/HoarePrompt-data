Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function works correctly for all potential cases of positive integer inputs. The annotations provided also accurately describe the logic of the function. Since the function handles all possible cases and the annotations are correct, we can conclude that the program is correct.
