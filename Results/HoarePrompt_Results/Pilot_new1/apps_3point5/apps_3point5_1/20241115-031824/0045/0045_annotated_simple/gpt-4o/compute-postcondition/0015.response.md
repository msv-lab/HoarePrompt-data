Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10, and `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula. `i` is `k - 2`. If remainder is 0, then the loop breaks. All variables retain their initial constraints and relationships after the if statement executes, covering all possible edge cases.***
