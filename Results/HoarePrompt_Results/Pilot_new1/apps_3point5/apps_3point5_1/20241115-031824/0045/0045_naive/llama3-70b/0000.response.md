Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input for n and k.
2. It handles the case where n is less than k and prints -1.
3. It then generates a sequence of k positive numbers that are strictly increasing and their sum is equal to n.
4. The program ensures that the greatest common divisor of the sequence is maximal.
5. If there is no possible sequence, it prints -1.
6. The program outputs the resulting sequence as required.
