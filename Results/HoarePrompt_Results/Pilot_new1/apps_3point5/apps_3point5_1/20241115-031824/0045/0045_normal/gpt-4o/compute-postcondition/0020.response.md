Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `sequence` is a list containing the values of d * (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1 with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 3`, `remainder` is a value other than 0. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
