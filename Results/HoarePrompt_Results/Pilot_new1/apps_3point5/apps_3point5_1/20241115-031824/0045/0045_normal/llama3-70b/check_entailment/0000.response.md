Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers 'n' and 'k' as input.
- It then checks if 'n' is less than 'k', if so it prints -1 as there is no possible sequence.
- Otherwise, it initializes an empty list 'seq' to store the sequence.
- It then iterates from 1 to 'k+1' and appends each number to the sequence list if 'n' is greater than or equal to that number, and subtracts that number from 'n'.
- If the length of the sequence list is not equal to 'k', it prints -1 as there is no possible sequence.
- Otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence by joining the elements of the list.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output as expected.
