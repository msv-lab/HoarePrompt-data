According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy (i.e., not equal to 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the new values of `a` and `b` depend on their previous values. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the new values of `a` and `b` should be such that `b` is still truthy. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The new values of `a` and `b` should be such that `b` is still truthy**
