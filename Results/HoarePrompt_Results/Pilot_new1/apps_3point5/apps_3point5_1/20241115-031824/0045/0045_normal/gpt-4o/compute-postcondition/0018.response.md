According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `k - 3`. Additionally, if `remainder` is not equal to 0, the loop should continue. Therefore, the `remainder` needs to be adjusted to a value other than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `sequence` is a list containing the values of d * (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1 with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 3`, `remainder` is a value other than 0**
