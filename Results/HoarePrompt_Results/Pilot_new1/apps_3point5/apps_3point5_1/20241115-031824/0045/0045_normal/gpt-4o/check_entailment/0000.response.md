Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input.
- The function `func_1(n, k)` calculates the minimum sum `min_sum` based on the value of `k`.
- If the `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that there is no possible sequence.
- Otherwise, the function calculates the value of `d` which is the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`.
- It then calculates the `remainder` which is the difference between `n` and `d * min_sum`.
- The function generates a sequence list by multiplying `d` with increasing numbers from 1 to `k`.
- It then increments the last element of the sequence list until the `remainder` reaches 0.
- Finally, it returns the updated sequence list as the output.
- The code seems to follow the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also agree with the code logic.
