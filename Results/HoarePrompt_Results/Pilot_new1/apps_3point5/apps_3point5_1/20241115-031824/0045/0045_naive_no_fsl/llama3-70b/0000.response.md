Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input of two integers n and k. It then calculates a sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n and whose greatest common divisor is maximized. The program iterates through the sequence, adding numbers from 1 to k until n is less than the current number. If the resulting sequence is not of length k, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it prints the sequence.

The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the expected output for all potential cases. The logic of the program is correct as it ensures that the sum of the sequence is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximized.
