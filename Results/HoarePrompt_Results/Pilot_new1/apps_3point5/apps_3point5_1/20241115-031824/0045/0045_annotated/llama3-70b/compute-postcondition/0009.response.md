Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two positive integers a and b, calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. If b is not 0, the function iterates through the algorithm until b becomes 0, at which point it returns the GCD. If b is 0 initially, the loop will not execute. The function accurately computes the GCD for the given input integers.**
