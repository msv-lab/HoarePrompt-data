Postcondition: ***`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is either -2 or a non-zero value, `i` is `k - 3`, and the value at index `i` in the `sequence` list is incremented by 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop breaks.***
