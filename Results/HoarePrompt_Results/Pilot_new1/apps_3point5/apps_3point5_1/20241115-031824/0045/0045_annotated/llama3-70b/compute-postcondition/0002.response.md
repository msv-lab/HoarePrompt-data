Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, so after execution, `a` will have the previous value of `b`, and `b` will have the result of `a % b`. Since `b` is truthy, it will be considered as 1 in calculations. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is truthy, `b` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is truthy, `b` is 1**
