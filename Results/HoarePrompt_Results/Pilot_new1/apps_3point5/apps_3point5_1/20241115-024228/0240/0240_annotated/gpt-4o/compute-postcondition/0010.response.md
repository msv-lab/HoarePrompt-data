Example Answer: 
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. Since `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, and `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `candidate` will be the next possible combination of digits. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits**
