Example Answer:
The function yields the value of `candidate`, which is formed by joining the characters in `perm`. Since `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the first possible combination of digits. The function `is_valid_number` returns true for `candidate` and `sub`. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the first possible combination of digits, and the function `is_valid_number` returns true for `candidate` and `sub`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the first possible combination of digits, and the function `is_valid_number` returns true for `candidate` and `sub**`.
