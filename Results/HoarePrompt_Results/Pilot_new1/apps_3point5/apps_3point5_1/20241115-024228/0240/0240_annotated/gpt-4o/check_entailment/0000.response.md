Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the problem description by taking a string `s` and a substring `sub`, then finding the smallest possible initial integer `n` that could have been passed to Kate.
- The function `func_1` updates character counts, generates possible numbers from remaining characters, and returns the smallest number.
- The function `is_valid_number` checks if a number is valid based on the substring and length.
- The function `generate_possible_numbers` generates permutations of characters and yields candidates that pass the validity check.
- The code annotations explain the state of the program after each function or loop execution, providing clarity on the logic being used.
- The code handles the case where the substring `sub` is present in the large integer `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`, ensuring the correctness of the output for all potential cases.
