Example Answer:
The string `perm` is joined together to form a new string `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits based on the permutation of characters in `chars`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits.
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits**
