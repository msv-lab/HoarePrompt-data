According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are permutations of the characters in `chars` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the first possible combination of digits. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated. This means that the states of `perm`, `candidate`, and potentially `sub` need to be adjusted to represent the next permutation and possible combination of digits.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits**
