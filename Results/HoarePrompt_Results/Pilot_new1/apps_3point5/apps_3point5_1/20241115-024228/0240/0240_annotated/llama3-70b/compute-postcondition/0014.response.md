Output State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer and not empty, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from `t`, `n` is a string containing only the characters from `s` that are also in `t`, `c` is the current character being processed in `s`, and if `c` is in `t_set`, it is added to `n`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged. If `t_set` is empty, `n` remains an empty string.**
