Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code does not fully adhere to the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the smallest possible initial integer `n` by iterating through each character in `s` and appending the character to the string `n` if it is present in the set `t_set`. However, the code does not consider the order of the characters in the substring `t` when constructing the integer `n`. It simply appends the characters in the order they appear in `s`. This means that the code may not always produce the smallest possible integer `n`. 

For example, if `s = "003512"` and `t = "021"`, the correct output should be `30021` as it is the smallest integer that can be formed by the given conditions. However, the code will output `30012` which is not the smallest integer possible. 

Therefore, the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description and is considered incorrect.
