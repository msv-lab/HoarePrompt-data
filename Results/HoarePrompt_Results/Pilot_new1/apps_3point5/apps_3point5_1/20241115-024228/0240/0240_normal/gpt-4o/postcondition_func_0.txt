The function func_1 accepts two strings s and sub, calculates the difference in length between them, updates the character frequencies in s_counter by subtracting sub_counter, generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters in s, and then returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers. If sub_counter is empty, the function skips the loop and returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers.
