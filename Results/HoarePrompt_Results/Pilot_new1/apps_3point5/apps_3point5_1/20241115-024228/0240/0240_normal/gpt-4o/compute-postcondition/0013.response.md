According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations of characters in `chars`. If there are more permutations available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string resulting from joining permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more permutations available in `chars`.
State: **`candidate` is a string resulting from joining permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars` with more permutations available**
