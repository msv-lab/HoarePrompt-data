According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of `chars`. If there are more permutations available, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation of `perm` needs to be considered. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`.**
