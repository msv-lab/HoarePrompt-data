Example Answer:
The code yields the `candidate`, which is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`. The specific values of `candidate` and `perm` are not provided, so the output state is: `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`**
