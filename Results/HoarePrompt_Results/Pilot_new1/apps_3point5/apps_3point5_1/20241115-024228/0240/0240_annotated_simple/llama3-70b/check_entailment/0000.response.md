Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through each character in `s` and only appends it to `n` if it is present in `t_set`, which contains the characters from `t`. After that, it appends the entire substring `t` to `n`. This logic ensures that the smallest possible initial integer `n` is constructed based on the substring `t` that Vasya remembers. The program handles the problem description correctly for all potential cases, as it constructs the integer `n` in the required way.
