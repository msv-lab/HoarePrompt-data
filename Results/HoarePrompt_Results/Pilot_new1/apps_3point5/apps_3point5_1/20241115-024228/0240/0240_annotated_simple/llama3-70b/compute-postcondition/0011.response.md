Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer with more characters left, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the updated value after concatenation if `c` is in `t_set`, `c` is the character after `n` in string `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, `n` is concatenated with `c`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
