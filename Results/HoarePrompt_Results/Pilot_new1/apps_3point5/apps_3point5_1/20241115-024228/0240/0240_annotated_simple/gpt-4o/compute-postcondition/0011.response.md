Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the `candidate` which is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`. Since the initial state of `perm` is unknown, the output state will be: `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`**
