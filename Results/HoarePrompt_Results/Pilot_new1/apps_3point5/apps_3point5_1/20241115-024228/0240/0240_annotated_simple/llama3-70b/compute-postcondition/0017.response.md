Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `t`, where `s` is a string representing a very large integer, and `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`. The function iterates through each character in `s` and concatenates it to `n` only if it is present in `t_set`, which is a set created from string `t`. At the end, the function returns the integer value of `n` after concatenating `t` for each character in `s` that is present in `t_set`. It does not handle cases where `t_set` is empty, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.**
