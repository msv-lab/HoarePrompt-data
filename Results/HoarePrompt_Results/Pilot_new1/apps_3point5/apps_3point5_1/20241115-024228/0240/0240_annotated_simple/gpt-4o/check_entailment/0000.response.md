Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines three functions: `func_1`, `is_valid_number`, and `generate_possible_numbers`.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the smallest possible initial integer `n` that Vasya could pass to Kate based on the input string and the remembered substring. It uses the `Counter` class to count the occurrences of characters in the input string and the substring. It then generates possible numbers by permuting the remaining characters and checks if they are valid using the `is_valid_number` function.
3. The `is_valid_number` function checks if a candidate number contains the remembered substring and has the correct length.
4. The `generate_possible_numbers` function generates all permutations of the remaining characters and yields valid candidates.
5. The program correctly handles the given problem description of reconstructing the smallest integer `n` from a shuffled string and a remembered substring.
6. The program logic and flow are correct, ensuring that the output is the smallest possible integer `n` that Vasya could have passed to Kate.
7. Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all potential cases.
