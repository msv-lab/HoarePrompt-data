Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to construct the smallest possible integer `n` that contains the substring `t`. The program correctly constructs `n` by only including the characters in `s` that are also in `t`, and then appends the substring `t` to the end. The logic of the program is sound and it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
