Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, and `remainder` is between 0 and 5, the value of `result` can vary depending on the values of `n` and `remainder`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is between 0 and 5, `result` is the result of n - remainder**
