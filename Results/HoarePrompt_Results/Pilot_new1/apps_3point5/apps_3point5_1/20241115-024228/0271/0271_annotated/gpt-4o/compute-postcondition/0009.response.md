Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, computes a result. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is `n - remainder`, otherwise, the result is `n + (10 - remainder)`. The function then prints the calculated result. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on user input.**
