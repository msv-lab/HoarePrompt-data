Example Answer:
The code prints the result of n + (10 - n % 10). Since n % 10 is greater than 5, the value of (10 - n % 10) will be less than 10. Therefore, the output state is not affected by the print statement.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that n % 10 is not equal to 0, and n % 10 is greater than 5**
