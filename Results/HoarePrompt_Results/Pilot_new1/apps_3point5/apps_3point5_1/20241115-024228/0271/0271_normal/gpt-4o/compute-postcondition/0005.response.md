Example Answer:
The value of `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`. Since `remainder` is the last digit of `n` and is greater than 5, the value of `remainder` must be between 6 and 9. Therefore, `10 - remainder` will be between 1 and 4. Adding this value to `n` will result in a new value for `result`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n` and is greater than 5, `result` is the sum of `n` and (10 - remainder)**.
