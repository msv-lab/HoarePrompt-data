Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly rounds the input number `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0, as described in the problem statement. If `n` is already divisible by 10, then the code prints `n`, which is correct. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, the code correctly rounds down to the nearest integer ending with 0 by subtracting the last digit from `n`. Similarly, if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, the code correctly rounds up to the nearest integer ending with 0 by adding the difference between 10 and the last digit of `n`. The code covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output.
