Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if the input number is divisible by 10, if so, it prints the number itself. If the input number is not divisible by 10, it determines the nearest integer ending in 0 by rounding down if the last digit is less than or equal to 5, and rounding up if the last digit is greater than 5. The program covers all possible cases and provides the correct output.
