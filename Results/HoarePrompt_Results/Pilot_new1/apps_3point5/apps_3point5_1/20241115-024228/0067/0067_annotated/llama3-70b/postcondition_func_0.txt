The `func` function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints a specific character based on the conditions. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, it prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y` and not greater than `y + z`, it prints '-'. If `x` equals `y` and `z` equals 0, it prints '0'. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is not 0, it prints '?'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, it prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
