Functionality: **The function reads three integers from the input, calculates various upvote and downvote ranges based on these integers, and then determines whether to print a plus sign, a question mark, or a minus sign based on the relationships between these ranges. The function handles cases where the upvote and downvote ranges overlap, are equal, or have a minimal difference. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
