Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The value of x is less than or equal to y + z. If x is less than y, the program prints "-". If x is equal to y and z is 0, the program prints "0". If x is equal to y and z is not 0, the program prints "?". If x is not equal to y, the program prints "?".***
