Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers. `min_upvotes` is the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is the value of `y`, `max_downvotes` is the value of `y + z`. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false. `max_downvotes` is not less than `min_upvotes`***
