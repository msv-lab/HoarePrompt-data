Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers. `min_upvotes` is the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is the value of `y`, `max_downvotes` is the value of `y + z`. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, the program prints a dash. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the program prints a plus sign. Otherwise, the program prints a question mark.***
