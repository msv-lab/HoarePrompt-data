According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, inclusive, and `n` is the length of string `s`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i` less than `n // 2` needs to be satisfied. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` should be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, inclusive, and `n` is the length of string `s` where `n` is greater than 2**
