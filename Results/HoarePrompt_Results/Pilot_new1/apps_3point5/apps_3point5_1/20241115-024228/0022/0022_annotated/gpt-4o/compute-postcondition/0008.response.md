According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` where `n` is greater than 2. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than `n // 2`. Since `i` starts from 0, the value of `i` needs to be less than `n // 2 - 1`.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` where `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1**
