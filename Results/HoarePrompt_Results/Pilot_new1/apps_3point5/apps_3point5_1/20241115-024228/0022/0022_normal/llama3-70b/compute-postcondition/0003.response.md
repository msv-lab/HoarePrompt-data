According to the code, the loop can execute if the string length `n` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `is_spalindrome` being True does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 0.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s` and at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
