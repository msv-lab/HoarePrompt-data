Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. This condition covers all cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in `s` are not equal, leading to the function returning False.***
