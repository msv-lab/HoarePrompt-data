According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` and at least 2, and `is_spalindrome` is True. To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 4 to ensure that `n // 2` is greater than the current value of `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s` and at least 5, `is_spalindrome` is True**
