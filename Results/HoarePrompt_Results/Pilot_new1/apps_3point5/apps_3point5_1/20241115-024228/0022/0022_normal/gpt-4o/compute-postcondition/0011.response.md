According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `i` is less than `n // 2`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` to move to the next iteration.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1**
