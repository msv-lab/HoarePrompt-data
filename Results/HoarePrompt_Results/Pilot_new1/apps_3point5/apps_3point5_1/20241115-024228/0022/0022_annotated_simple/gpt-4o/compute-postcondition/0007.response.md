Postcondition: ***s is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, n is an integer representing the length of the string and n is at least 2, i is 1. If s[i] is not equal to s[n - 1 - i], the function returns False. In all other cases where s[i] is equal to s[n - 1 - i], the program continues execution without altering the initial state.***
