The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It calculates the integer `n` representing the length of the string, ensuring that `n` is at least 2. The function then checks if `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters at corresponding positions. If any pair of characters does not match, it returns False. If the string is a palindrome, it returns True. If the length of the string is less than 2, the function returns True.
