The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. The function also calculates the integer `n` representing the length of the string, ensuring that `n` is at least 2. 

In Case_1, the function checks if each character `s[i]` is equal to its corresponding character `s[n - 1 - i]` for any `i` in the range of `n // 2`. If any pair of characters does not match, the function returns False. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, the function returns True. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute.

In Case_2, the program simply returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, calculate the length `n`, and check if the string is a palindrome. If the string is a palindrome, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, the function returns True.
