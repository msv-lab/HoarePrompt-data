Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, `i` is adjusted to the next value, and the loop or if statement is exited. This condition covers all possible cases of the program fragment execution, ensuring the correct adjustment of variables and the maintenance of the program state.***
