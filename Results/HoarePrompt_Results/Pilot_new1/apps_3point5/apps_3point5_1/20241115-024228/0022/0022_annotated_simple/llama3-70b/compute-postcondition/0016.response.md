According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `i` is adjusted to the next value. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value.
State: **`s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is adjusted to the next value**
