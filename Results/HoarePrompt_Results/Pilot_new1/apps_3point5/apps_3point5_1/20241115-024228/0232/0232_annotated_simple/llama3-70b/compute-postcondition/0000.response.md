Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values based on the input split by space. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, where each color is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 <= sum(k_i) <= n.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, where each color is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 <= sum(k_i) <= n**
