Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is an empty dictionary, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary containing `color` as a key with a value of 1, `i` is less than `n+1`, if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then it is added with a value of 0. All the values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is True, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. After the if statement executes, the program state remains the same as the precondition, with the additional condition that if all values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the values in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. No changes are made to the other variables or data structures.***
