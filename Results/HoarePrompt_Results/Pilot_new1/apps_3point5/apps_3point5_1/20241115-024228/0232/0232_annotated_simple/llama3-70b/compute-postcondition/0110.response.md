Output State: **After the execution of the if statement, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is a key, and the corresponding value is incremented by 1. `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `i+1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. All values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, and `found` is set to True. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. In all cases, the overall state of the program ensures that the conditions specified in the precondition are maintained, and the loop terminates when all values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts.**
