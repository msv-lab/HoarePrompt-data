Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It calculates the counts of colors in the `colors` list and compares them to the desired counts in `k`. If all colors have their counts matching, it returns 'YES'. If not, it returns 'NO'. The function iterates through the colors and adjusts the counts accordingly until the condition is met or all colors have been checked. **
