Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`. `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the colors list. `n` is a positive integer. `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n. `i` is 0. `window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the color `color` with a count of 1. `j` is equal to `i` + 1. `color` is assigned the value of colors[j]. `window_counts[color]` is either incremented by 1 if `color` is already in `window_counts`, or `color` is added to the dictionary with a count of 0 if it is not present. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after the if condition is satisfied.***
