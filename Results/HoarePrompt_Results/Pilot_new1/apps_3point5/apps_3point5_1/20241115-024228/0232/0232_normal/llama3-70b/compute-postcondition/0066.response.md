Output State: **`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`. `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the colors list. `n` is a positive integer. `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n. `i` is 1. `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color with the count of `color` being 1. `j` is equal to `i + 1` and less than `n`. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. The overall state of the program after the if statement is that `found` is True if the condition (all((count == target for (count, target) in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts)))) is met.**
