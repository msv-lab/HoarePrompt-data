Example Answer:
The code increments the value of color_counts[color] by 1. If color is not present in color_counts, it is initialized to 0 and then incremented. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is at least 1, m is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of n integers, counts is a list of integers obtained from input, color_counts is a dictionary where color_counts[color] is incremented by 1.
Output State: **n is at least 1, m is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of n integers, counts is a list of integers obtained from input, color_counts is a dictionary where color_counts[color] is incremented by 1**
