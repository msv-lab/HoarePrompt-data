Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`. `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the colors list. `n` is a positive integer. `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n. `i` is 0. `window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the count of each color in the `colors` list within the specified window. If the loop does not execute, `found` remains False and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.***
