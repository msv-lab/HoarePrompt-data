Example Answer:
`current_counts` is initialized as an empty defaultdict with default value 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count; `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count; `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0**
