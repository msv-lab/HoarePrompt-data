Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights to check if the desired counts of lightsabers of each color can be achieved. It keeps track of the color counts in each interval and compares them with the desired counts. If a matching interval is found, it sets the "found" flag to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints "YES" if a valid interval is found, otherwise it prints "NO". The logic seems correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
