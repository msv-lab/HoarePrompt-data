According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `window_counts` is a dictionary with an incremented value for the `color` key, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with an incremented value for the `color` key, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i+1**.
