Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with an incremented value for the `color` key, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i`. If all values in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding values in `counts` after sorting, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
