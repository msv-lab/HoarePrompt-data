Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, colors, and counts. It then creates a dictionary `color_counts` to store the counts of each color in the colors list. After that, it iterates through combinations of colors and their counts to check if a specific condition is met. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.**
