Example Answer:
The list `colors` is assigned the result of mapping the input values to integers. The input values are split by spaces. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n**
