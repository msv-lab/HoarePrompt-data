Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n. Therefore, the output state is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n.
