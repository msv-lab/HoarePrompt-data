According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `window_counts` being an empty dictionary does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n` and `j` is equal to `i`.
State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`**
