Example Answer:
`current_counts` is initialized as a defaultdict with an integer type. The dictionary `desired_counts` is not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the input lists `k` and `m`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with an integer type.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the input lists `k` and `m`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with an integer type**
