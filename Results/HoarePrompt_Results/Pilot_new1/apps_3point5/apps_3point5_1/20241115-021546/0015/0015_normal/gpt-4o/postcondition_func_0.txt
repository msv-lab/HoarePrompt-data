The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks various conditions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function covers edge cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
