Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the favorite number `b` appears in the sequence generated starting from `a` with a difference of `c` between neighboring elements. It handles the cases where `b` is equal to `a`, `c` is equal to 0, and the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is met. The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' as required by the problem description. Since no case has been found where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is considered True.
