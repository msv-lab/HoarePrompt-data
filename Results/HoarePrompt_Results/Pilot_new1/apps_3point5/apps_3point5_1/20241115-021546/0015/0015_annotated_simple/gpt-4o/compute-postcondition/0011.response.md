Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is not equal to 0. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` meet the specified criteria and appropriately outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.***
