Example Answer: 
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9**
