Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It checks if the favorite number b appears in the sequence s by comparing it with the first element a. If b is equal to a, it prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it further checks if the difference between a and b is divisible by c and if the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES'. If none of the conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. The code handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. The annotations also align with the logic of the code and provide additional information about the program state after each if-else block has been executed. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
