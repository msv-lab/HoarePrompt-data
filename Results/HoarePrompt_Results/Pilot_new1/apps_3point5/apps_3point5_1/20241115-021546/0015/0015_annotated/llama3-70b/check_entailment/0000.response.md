Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, and then based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it determines if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence. The program handles two cases: 
1. If `c` is equal to 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This aligns with the scenario where the sequence is just a repetition of the same number, in which case `b` will appear in the sequence.
2. If `c` is not equal to 0, it checks if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) holds true, and prints 'YES' if it does, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This covers the scenario where the sequence has a constant difference between consecutive elements and checks if `b` can be reached from the starting number `a` based on that difference.

The annotations provide insight into the logic flow of the program and describe the state of the program after each if-else block. They confirm that the program covers both cases mentioned in the problem description and handles the specified conditions correctly. Since the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases and the provided examples, the correctness is deemed to be true.
