Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained by splitting the input. The value of `c` is not equal to 0. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) holds true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is not equal to 0, and the division and modulo operations meet the specified conditions.***
