The function reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. It then checks if b is equal to a and prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it further checks if c is equal to 0, in which case it prints 'NO'. If c is not equal to 0, it calculates whether (b - a) is divisible by c and if the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES'. If none of the previous conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
