Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if the favorite number b appears in the sequence based on the given conditions. 
1. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0 (c == 0), then it checks if the first element a is equal to b, and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. This covers the case where the sequence is constant and b is equal to a.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is not 0 (c != 0), then it calculates if b can be reached from a by adding multiples of c. If the difference (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This covers the case where b can be reached from a by adding multiples of c.

Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
