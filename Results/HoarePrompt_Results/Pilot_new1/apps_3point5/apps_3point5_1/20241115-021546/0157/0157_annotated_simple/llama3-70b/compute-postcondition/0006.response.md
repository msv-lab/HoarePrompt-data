Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integer inputs from the user, calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be bought based on the inputs, and then prints the total cost of buying those lemons. The total cost is calculated as the sum of the minimum lemons bought, double the minimum lemons bought, and quadruple the minimum lemons bought. The function does not have any return value. **
