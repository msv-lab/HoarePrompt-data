Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the alphabet and replaces each character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order until the entire alphabet is formed as a subsequence. It then checks if the length of the resulting string is 26 (the length of the alphabet) and prints the result or -1 accordingly. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and it handles all potential cases correctly.
