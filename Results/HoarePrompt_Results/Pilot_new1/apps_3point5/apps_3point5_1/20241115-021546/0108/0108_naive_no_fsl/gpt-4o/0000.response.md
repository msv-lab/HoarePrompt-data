Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program takes the input string `s` and checks if it contains the English alphabet in order as a subsequence.
2. It iterates through both `s` and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' simultaneously, checking if the characters match.
3. If all characters in the target string are found in `s` in order, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1.
4. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence.
