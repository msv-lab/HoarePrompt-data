Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. Since the `char` is the newly added character, it will be replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains all small English letters in order along with the newly added character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence.
Output State: **`res` contains all small English letters in order along with the newly added character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence**
