Example Answer:
`char` is added to the end of the string `res`, which contains all small English letters in order including the next letter in the alphabet. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of the next character in the alphabet, `res` contains all small English letters in order including the next letter in the alphabet, `char` is the subsequent letter in the alphabet after the current `char` in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of the next character in the alphabet, `res` contains all small English letters in order including the next letter in the alphabet, `char` is the subsequent letter in the alphabet after the current `char` in `s`**
