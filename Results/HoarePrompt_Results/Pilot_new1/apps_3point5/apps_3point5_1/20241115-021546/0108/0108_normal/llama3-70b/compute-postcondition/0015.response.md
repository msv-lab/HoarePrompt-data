Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `char`, so the final value of `res` depends on the initial value of `res` and `char`. If the loop terminated early, `res` contains all small English letters up to that point, and `char` is the next small English letter. If the loop executed till the end, `res` contains all small English letters in order, and `char` is the last small English letter. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order, `char` is the next or last small English letter in the alphabet.
Output State: **`res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order, `char` is the next or last small English letter in the alphabet**
