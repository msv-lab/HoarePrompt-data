Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input, iterates over the lowercase English alphabet, and for each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character exists in the input string `s`. If the character is found, it appends that character to the result string `res` and replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. The function prints the resulting string `res` if it contains all 26 lowercase English letters in order; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not have a specific return value. **
