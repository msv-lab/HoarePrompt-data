According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 3, and `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, `j` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` needs to be less than the length of `s`.
2. `j` needs to be less than `target_len`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than `target_len`.**
