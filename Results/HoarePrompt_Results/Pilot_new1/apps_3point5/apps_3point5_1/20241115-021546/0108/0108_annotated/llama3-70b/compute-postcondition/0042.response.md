Postcondition: ***If 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' will be the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'. If the length of 'res' is equal to 26, the function will print 'res'. If 's' does not contain all lowercase English letters, the loop will not execute, and 'res' will remain empty. 'char' is not defined after the loop finishes. In the else part, if 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' will be the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's', and 'char' is not defined. If 's' does not contain all lowercase English letters, the function will print -1.***
