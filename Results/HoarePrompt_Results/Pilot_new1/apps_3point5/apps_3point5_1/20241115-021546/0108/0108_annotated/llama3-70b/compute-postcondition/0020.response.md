According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, so it is guaranteed that the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **'s' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'**
