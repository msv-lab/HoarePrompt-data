Example Answer:
The `char` character in string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The replacement is done only once. The updated string `s` is stored back in `s`. The `res` variable is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in the original `s`, so it will change accordingly after the replacement operation.
Output State: **'s' is the updated string after replacing 'char' with the next character in the alphabet, 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in the updated 's', 'char' has been added to 'res'**
