Example Answer:
'res' is concatenated with 'char', where 'char' is added to 'res'. The previous values of 'res' and 'char' are unknown. Therefore, the output state is 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's' and 'char' is added to 'res'.
Output State: **If 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's' and 'char' is added to 'res'**
