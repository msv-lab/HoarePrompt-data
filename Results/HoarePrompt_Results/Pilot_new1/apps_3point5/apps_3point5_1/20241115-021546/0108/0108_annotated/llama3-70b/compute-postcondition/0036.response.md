According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable 's' containing all lowercase English letters at least once. If 's' does contain all lowercase English letters at least once, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, if 's' does contain all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, 's' must contain all lowercase English letters at least once and 'res' should be updated accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'.**
