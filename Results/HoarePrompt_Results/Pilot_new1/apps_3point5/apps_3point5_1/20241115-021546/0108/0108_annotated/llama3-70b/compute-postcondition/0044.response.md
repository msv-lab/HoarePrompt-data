Functionality: ** The function takes an input string `s` containing lowercase English letters. It iterates over each letter in the alphabet and checks if that letter is present in the input string. If the letter is found, it appends it to the result string `res` and replaces the letter in the input string with the next letter in the alphabet. If the length of the resulting string `res` is 26 (indicating all letters were found in the input string), it prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not handle cases where the input string does not contain all lowercase English letters or when the input string is empty.**
