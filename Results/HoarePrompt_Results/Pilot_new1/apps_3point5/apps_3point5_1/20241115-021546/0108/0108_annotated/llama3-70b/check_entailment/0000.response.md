Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code iterates over each letter in the alphabet and checks if that letter is present in the input string. If found, it appends it to the result string and replaces the letter in the input string with the next letter in the alphabet. If the resulting string contains all 26 letters of the alphabet, it prints the result. If not, it prints -1. The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it correctly handles the scenario of making moves to get the English alphabet as a subsequence from the given input string. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the code logic and its limitations. Since there are no examples provided where the code does not work as expected, and the code annotations align with the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
