According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` + 1 and `j` is less than 27, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s` + 1, and `j` is less than 27. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` needs to be less than or equal to the length of `s`, and `j` needs to be less than 26.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26**
