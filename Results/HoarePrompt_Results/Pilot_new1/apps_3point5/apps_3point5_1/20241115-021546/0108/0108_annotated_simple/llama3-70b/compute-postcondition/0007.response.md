Example Answer: 
`res` is concatenated with `char`, so `res` becomes 'ab'. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b', and the first occurrence of 'a' in `s` is replaced with 'b'.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b', and the first occurrence of 'a' in `s` is replaced with 'b'**
