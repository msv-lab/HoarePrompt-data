Example Answer:
The first occurrence of 'b' in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after 'b' in the alphabet, which is 'c'. Therefore, after execution, the string `s` will have the first occurrence of 'a' replaced with 'c'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'c', `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'**
