Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than the length of `target` and `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than the length of `target`, and `j` is incremented by 1**
