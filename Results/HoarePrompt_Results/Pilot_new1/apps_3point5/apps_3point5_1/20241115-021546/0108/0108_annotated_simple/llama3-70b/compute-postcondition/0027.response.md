Example Answer:
The character 'char' is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once. If 'char' is present in 's', it will be replaced, otherwise, 's' remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' is updated with 'char' replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once.
Output State: **'s' is updated with 'char' replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once**
