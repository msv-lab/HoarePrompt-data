According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `used_cubes[i]` is True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` should be set to False to allow the loop to execute again.
- `found` should be set to False to allow the loop to continue searching.
State: **`digits` list has at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list has at least one element which is `False`, `found` is False, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `used_cubes[i]` is False, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i`]**.
