According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more digits in the `digits` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` list has at least one digit, `digit` being the next digit in the list, `used_cubes` list has at least one more element set to True if the condition is met, and `found` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the next `digit` needs to be the next digit in the list, and `used_cubes` list needs to have at least one more element set to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`digits` list with at least one digit, `digit` being the next digit in the list, `used_cubes` list with at least two elements set to True, and `found` is False**
