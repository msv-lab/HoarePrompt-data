The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. The function iterates through the `used_cubes` list and checks if each `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` for each element. If the condition is met, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. The loop will execute at least once if `num` is greater than 0. If `num` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute. The state after the loop includes `digits` list with at least one digit, `digit` being the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list with at least one element set to True if the condition is met, and `found` being True if the condition is met. If `found` is False, the program returns False. If the condition is met for all elements in the loop, the program returns True.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num and iterates through the used_cubes list to check if each digit is in cube_faces. If the condition is met for at least one digit, it sets the corresponding element in used_cubes to True and returns True. If the condition is not met for any digit, it returns False.**
