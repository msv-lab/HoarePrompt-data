According to the code, the loop can execute if the `digits` list has at least one digit. Since the length of `used_cubes` is unknown, we need to ensure that the loop can execute regardless of its length. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state such that `digits` list has at least one digit and `digit` is the first digit in the list, and `used_cubes` list has at least one element which is `False`.
State: **`digits` list has at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list has at least one element which is `False`**
