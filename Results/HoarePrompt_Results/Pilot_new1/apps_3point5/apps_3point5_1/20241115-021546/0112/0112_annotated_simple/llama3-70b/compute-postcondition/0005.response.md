According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of lists in the `cubes` and the value of `n`. If the number of lists in `cubes` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` contains 1 to 3 lists of integers read from the input, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes. Since `n` is between 1 and 3, and `cubes` contains 1 to 3 lists, for the loop to execute one more time, the number of lists in `cubes` must be less than `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` contains 1 to 2 lists of integers read from the input; `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the cubes**
