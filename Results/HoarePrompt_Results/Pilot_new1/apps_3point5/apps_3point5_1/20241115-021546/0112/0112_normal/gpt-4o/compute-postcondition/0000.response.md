Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of strings obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string and then converting each character to a separate element of the list. The previous value of `num` is unknown, so the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, and `digits` is a list of strings representing the digits of each cube.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `digits` is a list of strings representing the digits of each cube**
