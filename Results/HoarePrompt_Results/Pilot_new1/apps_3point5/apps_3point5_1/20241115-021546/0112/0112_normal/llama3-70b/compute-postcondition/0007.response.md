According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If there are more cubes in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of (n+1) lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube and any additional digits added from the cubes after updating. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `cubes` list must have more than (n+1) lists. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of (n+2) lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube and any additional digits added from the cubes after updating**
