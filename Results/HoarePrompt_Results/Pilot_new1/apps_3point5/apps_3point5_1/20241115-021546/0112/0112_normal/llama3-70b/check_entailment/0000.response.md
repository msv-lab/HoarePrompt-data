Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the number of cubes Masha has, then reads the faces of each cube. It extracts all unique digits from these cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them into a single number, and prints the resulting maximum number. This logic aligns with the problem description, as it finds the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, as it considers all digits present on the cubes and constructs the maximum number accordingly. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it correctly follows the problem description.
