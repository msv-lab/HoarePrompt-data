According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 3 digits, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list with at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second digit in the list, `found` is False. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `digits` must have at least 3 digits, and the `digit` should be the third digit in the list with `found` still being False.
State: **At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 3 digits, `digit` is the third digit in the list, `found` is False**
