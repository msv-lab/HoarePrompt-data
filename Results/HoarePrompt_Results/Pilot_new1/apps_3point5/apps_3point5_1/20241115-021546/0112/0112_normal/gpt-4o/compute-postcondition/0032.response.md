The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, where `num` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers representing the digits on each face of the cube. 

Case_1: If at least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, if `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, if `digit` is the first digit in the list, and if `found` is True, then the program returns False if `n` is greater than 0 and the loop or if statement is broken out after the if condition is met. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False.

Case_2: The program returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `num` representing the number of cubes, and based on the conditions specified in the cases, return True or False.
