According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cubes`. If the list has more elements, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of n lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `cubes` must have more than n lists.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of (n+1) lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube**
