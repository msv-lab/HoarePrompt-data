Output State: **If n is at least 1, after the loop executes, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in all cubes combined. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and `digits` remains an empty set. Additionally, if '0' is in digits, it is removed. Then `max_num` is assigned the integer value obtained by converting the sorted `digits` set into a single string and then sorting it in descending order.**
