Example Answer:
The set `digits` is updated to include the individual digits of the third cube by converting each digit to a string. Since `cube` is the third cube in the list, the set `digits` now contains the individual digits of the third cube. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of the third cube, `cube` is the third cube in the list**
