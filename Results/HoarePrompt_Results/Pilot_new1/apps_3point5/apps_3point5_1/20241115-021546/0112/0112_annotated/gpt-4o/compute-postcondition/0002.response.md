According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. If digits is a non-empty list, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists, and used_cubes is a list of n elements, each set to False. To ensure the loop executes, the digits list must be non-empty.
State: **n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists, used_cubes is a list of n elements, each set to False, digits is a non-empty list**
