According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 4 cubes, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing the individual digits of the third cube, cube is the third cube in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 cubes, and the cube is the fourth cube in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 4 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of the fourth cube, `cube` is the fourth cube in the list**
