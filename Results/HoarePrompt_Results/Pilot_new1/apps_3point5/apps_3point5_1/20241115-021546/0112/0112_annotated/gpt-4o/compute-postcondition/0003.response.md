Example Answer: 
`found` is assigned the value `False`. Since `found` was explicitly set to `False`, the value remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists, used_cubes is a list of n elements, each set to False, digits is a non-empty list, found is False.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists, used_cubes is a list of n elements, each set to False, digits is a non-empty list, found is False**
