According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `digits` and the condition specified. If there exists at least one cube where digit is present and n is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if the condition is met, used_cubes will have True values at indices where the condition is met, found will be True, and the loop will terminate. If there is no cube where digit is present or n is 0, the loop will not execute, and all variables will retain their initial values. In the case where not found, the program will return False.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **If the loop executes again, used_cubes will have True values at indices where the condition is met, found will be True, and the loop will terminate.**
