Example Answer:
The set `digits` is updated to contain the individual digits of the second cube by converting each digit to a string. The previous values of `digits`, `cube`, and `cubes` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of the second cube, `cube` is the second cube in the list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of the second cube, `cube` is the second cube in the list**
