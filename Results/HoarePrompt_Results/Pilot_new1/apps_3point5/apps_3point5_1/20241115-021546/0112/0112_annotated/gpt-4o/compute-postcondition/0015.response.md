According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where the cube at index i is marked as True if not used_cubes[i], `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is a non-empty list, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 2**
