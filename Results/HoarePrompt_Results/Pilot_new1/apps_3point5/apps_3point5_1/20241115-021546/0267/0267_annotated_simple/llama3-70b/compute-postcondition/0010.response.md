According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, k is a positive integer, so it satisfies the condition. Additionally, n is a non-negative integer, and k is a positive integer. Since the loop is defined from 1 to k (exclusive), the loop will not execute if k is less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that n is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of k, k is greater than 1, and i is 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer greater than 1, n is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of k, dp is a dictionary to store computed values**
