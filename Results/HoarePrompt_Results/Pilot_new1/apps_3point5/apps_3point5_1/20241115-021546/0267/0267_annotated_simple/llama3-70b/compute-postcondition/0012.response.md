According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of dp[n, k] has been updated based on the given formula. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Updated value of dp[n, k] based on the given formula, `i` is incremented by 1**
