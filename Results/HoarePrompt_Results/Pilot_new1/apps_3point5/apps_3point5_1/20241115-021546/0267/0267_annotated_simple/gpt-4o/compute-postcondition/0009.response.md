Example Answer:
`total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The new value of `total_sum` is dependent on the previous value of `total_sum`, `num`, and `MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD, `l`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged**
