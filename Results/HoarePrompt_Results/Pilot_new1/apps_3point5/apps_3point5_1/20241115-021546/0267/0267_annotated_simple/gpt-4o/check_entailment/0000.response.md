Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, where `func_1` checks if the number has at most `k` different digits and `func_2` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition specified in the problem description.
2. The logic in `func_1` correctly determines if a number has at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string, converting it to a set to get unique digits, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to `k`.
3. The `func_2` function iterates through the range from `l` to `r` inclusive, checks if each number satisfies the condition using `func_1`, and updates the total sum accordingly.
4. The final result is returned as the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that meet the condition modulo `998244353`.
5. The program follows the problem description accurately and computes the correct sum for the given range and maximum number of different digits.
