Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values. If (n, k) is already in dp, then the function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. If (n, k) is not in dp, the function continues execution. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n.**
