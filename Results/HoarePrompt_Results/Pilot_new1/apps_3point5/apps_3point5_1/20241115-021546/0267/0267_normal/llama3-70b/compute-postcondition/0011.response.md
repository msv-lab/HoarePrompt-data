Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `n` and `k` are non-negative and positive integers respectively, and `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, the updated value of `dp[n, k]` will be based on the calculations involving these values.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` dictionary stores computed values, `i` is 1, and the value of `dp[n, k]` has been updated based on the provided expression.**
