The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the program returns the final value of `total_sum` after the loop execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the final value of `total_sum` after the loop execution.
