Functionality: ** The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer; `k`, a positive integer; and `dp`, a dictionary to store computed values. The function returns 0 if `k` is 0. If the key (n, k) is present in the dictionary `dp`, it returns the corresponding value. If (n, k) is not in dp, it calculates the value based on the provided formula and stores it in dp. The function then returns the value stored at key (n, k) in the dictionary dp. The function handles cases where `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k` and updates the dictionary accordingly. **
