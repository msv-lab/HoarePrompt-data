Example Answer: 
The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of the first element in list `A`, which is `A[0]`. The value of `A[0]` is obtained from input, so it can be any integer within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers within the specified ranges, A is a list of integers obtained from input, gcd is the first element of list A.
Output State: **N and K are integers within the specified ranges, A is a list of integers obtained from input, gcd is the first element of list A**
