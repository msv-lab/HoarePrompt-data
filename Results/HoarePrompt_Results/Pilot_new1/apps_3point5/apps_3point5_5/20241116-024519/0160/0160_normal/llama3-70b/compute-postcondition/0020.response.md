Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` value and `i`. The previous value of `max_divisor` is unknown, so the updated `max_divisor` value will be `i`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is assigned the updated value, i is the next value after the last iteration, max_divisor is the maximum value between the previous max_divisor and i.
Output State: **N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is assigned the updated value, i is the next value after the last iteration, max_divisor is the maximum value between the previous max_divisor and i**
