According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to N. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than N. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer greater than 1, K is an integer within the specified range, A is a list of integers obtained from input, gcd is the updated greatest common divisor of the elements in list A, i is equal to N-1**
