Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A and then iterates up to the square root of the gcd to find the maximum divisor. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
