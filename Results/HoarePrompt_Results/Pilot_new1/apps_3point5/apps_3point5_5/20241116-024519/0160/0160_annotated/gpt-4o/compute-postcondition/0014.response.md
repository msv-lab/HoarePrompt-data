According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, `x // 2`, `x // (i+1)`, `i`, and `x // i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the current value to continue checking divisors.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, `x // 2`, `x // (i+1)`, `i`, `x // i`, and the loop needs to continue with `i+1`**
