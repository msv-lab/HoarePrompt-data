According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, and `x // 2`. The positive integer `x` is divided by 2, and if the division has no remainder, the divisors set is updated with `i` and `x // i. This process ensures that all divisors of `x` are correctly identified and added to the set, maintaining the initial conditions of the positive integer `x` and `i` being 2. To execute one more time, the loop needs to adjust `i` to be incremented by 1 and add `x // (i+1)` to the `divisors` set.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, `x // 2`, and `x // (i+1)`. The positive integer `x` is divided by 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
