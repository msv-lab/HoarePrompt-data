The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `lst` using the `math.gcd` function. If the list has only one element, the GCD remains the same as that element. The program then returns the calculated GCD.
