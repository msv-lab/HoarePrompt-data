The function func_2 accepts an integer parameter x and calculates all the divisors of x. It then returns a sorted set of these divisors in reverse order. If x is not a positive number, the function returns an empty set. The code correctly finds all divisors of x by iterating up to the square root of x and considering both i and x // i as divisors if x is divisible by i.
