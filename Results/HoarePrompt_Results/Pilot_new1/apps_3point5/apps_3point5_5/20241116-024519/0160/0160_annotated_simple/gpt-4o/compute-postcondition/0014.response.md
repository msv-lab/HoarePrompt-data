According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `i < int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x+1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next positive integer after the last value used in the loop. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1, the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1.

State: **divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x+1, i is incremented by 1**
