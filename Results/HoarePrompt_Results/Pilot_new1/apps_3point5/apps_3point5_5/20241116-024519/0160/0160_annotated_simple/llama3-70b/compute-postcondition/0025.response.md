Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. Since `max_divisor` and `i` are positive integers, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum of the previous `max_divisor` and `i + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i + 1` are positive integers.
Output State: **`gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i + 1` are positive integers**
