Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is initially equal to `gcd`, and `gcd` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, the value of `max_divisor` remains the same as `gcd`. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd` is a positive integer, `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` and `gcd` is divisible by `i` without any remainder.
Output State: **`gcd` is a positive integer, `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` and `gcd` is divisible by `i` without any remainder**
