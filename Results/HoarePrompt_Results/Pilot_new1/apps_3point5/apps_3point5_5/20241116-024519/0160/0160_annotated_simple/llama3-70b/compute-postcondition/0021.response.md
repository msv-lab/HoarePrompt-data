Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i` where `i` starts from 1. Since `gcd` is divisible by `i + 1` without any remainder, the result of `gcd // i` will be an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd`, `N` are positive integers where `gcd` is divisible by `i + 1` without any remainder; `max_divisor` is equal to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i` if `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` is not equal to `gcd`.
Output State: **`gcd`, `N` are positive integers where `gcd` is divisible by `i + 1` without any remainder; `max_divisor` is equal to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i` if `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` is not equal to `gcd`**
