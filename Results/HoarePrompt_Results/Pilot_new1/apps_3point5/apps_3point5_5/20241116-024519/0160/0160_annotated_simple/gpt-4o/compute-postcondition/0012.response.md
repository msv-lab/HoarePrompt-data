Example Answer:
The code adds x // i to the set divisors. The initial state mentions that divisors contain all divisors of x, including i and x // i. Therefore, after executing the code, divisors will still contain all the divisors of x, including i and x // i.
Output State: **divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x+1**
