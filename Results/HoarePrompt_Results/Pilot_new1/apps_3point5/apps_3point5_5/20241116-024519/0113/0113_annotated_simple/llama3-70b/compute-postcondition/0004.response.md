Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^9. As `n` is incremented by 1, the new value of `n` will be the previous value + 1. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^9 incremented by 1; `k` is a positive integer between 0 and 8; `x` is the next higher value in the sequence {10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000} after the previous value of `x` where `n % x != 0`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^9 incremented by 1; `k` is a positive integer between 0 and 8; `x` is the next higher value in the sequence {10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000} after the previous value of `x` where `n % x != 0`**
