Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `k` are assigned by mapping the input values split by space to integers. Since the values of `n` and `k` are not provided in the initial state, the output state will be: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
