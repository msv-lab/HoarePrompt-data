Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
