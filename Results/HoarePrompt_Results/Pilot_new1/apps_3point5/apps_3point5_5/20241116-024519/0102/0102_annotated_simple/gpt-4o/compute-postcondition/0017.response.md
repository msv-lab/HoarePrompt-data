Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, and `n` is an integer. If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` from the `ones` list. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` from the `teens` list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, the function covers two cases: if n % 10 == 0, it returns the string representing the tens digit of `n`; otherwise, it returns the string representation of the number `n` in words, combining the string representing the tens digit of `n` with a hyphen and the string representing the ones digit of `n`. The postcondition ensures the correct representation of the tens and ones digits of the input integer `n` for all possible scenarios, including edge cases, and summarizes them concisely.***
