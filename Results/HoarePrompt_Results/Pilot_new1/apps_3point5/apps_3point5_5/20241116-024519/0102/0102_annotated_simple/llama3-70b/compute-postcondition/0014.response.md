Functionality: ** The function takes an integer input `s` between 0 and 99 and prints out the corresponding English word for that number. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word for that single digit number. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word for that number in the teens range. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the word for the tens place followed by the word for the ones place with a hyphen in between. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
