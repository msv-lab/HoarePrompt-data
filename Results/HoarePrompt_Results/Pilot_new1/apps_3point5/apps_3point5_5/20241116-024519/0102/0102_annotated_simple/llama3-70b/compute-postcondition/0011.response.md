Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine. If `s` is less than 20, the code prints the element at index `s - 10` from the `teens` list. Otherwise, the code concatenates the element at index `s // 10` from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the element at index `s % 10` from the `ones` list, unless `s % 10` is 0, in which case only the element at index `s // 10` from the `tens` list is printed.***
