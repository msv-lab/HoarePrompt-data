Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not between 11 and 19. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representing the tens digit of n. If n % 10 ≠ 0, the function returns the string representation of the number n in words, consisting of the string representing the tens digit of n concatenated with a hyphen and the string representing the ones digit of n. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the input values of s, ones, and n, ensuring the correct representation of the tens and ones digits of the input integer n.***
