Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, and n is not between 11 and 19. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the word representation of the tens place of n based on the index n // 10 in the list 'tens'. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the word representation of the tens place of n followed by a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place of n. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the given range of n values and accurately describes the output based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
