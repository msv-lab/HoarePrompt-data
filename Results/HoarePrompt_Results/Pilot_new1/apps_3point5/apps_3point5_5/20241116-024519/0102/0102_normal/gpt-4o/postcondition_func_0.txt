The function func_1 accepts an integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and returns the word representation of the number based on different conditions. If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the word representation from the 'ones' list. If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the word representation from the 'teens' list. For numbers between 10 and 99 (excluding the teens), it returns the concatenation of the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place. The function covers all possible scenarios within the given range of n values.
