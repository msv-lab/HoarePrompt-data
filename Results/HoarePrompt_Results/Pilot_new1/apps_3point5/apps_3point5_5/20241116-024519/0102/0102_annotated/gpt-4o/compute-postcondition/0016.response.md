Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and `tens` is a list of strings representing tens digits from 0 to 90. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representing the teens digit corresponding to the integer `n`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not in the teens range, the function handles all scenarios within this range. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representing the tens digit of the integer `n` from the `tens` list. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the tens and ones digits of the integer `n` separated by a hyphen. The program accounts for all possible cases, including the edge cases of n being the minimum (10) and maximum (99) values, ensuring the correct representation of the tens and ones digits for any valid input value of `n`.***
