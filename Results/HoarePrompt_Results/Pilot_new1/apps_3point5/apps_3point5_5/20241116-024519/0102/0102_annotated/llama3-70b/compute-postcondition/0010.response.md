Example Answer:
The code concatenates the string from the `tens` list at index `s // 10` with a hyphen and the string from the `ones` list at index `s % 10` if `s % 10` is not equal to 0. Since `s` is an input integer between 20 and 99, the output will be the concatenation of the tens place string and the ones place string. 
Output State: **`s` is an input integer such that 20 <= s <= 99; `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from 0 to 9; `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers, and the code prints the string representation of `s` based on the `ones` and `tens` lists.**
