Functionality: The function func_1 accepts an integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and a list of strings representing tens digits. It provides the string representation of the input integer n based on its tens and ones digits. If n is in the range 0 to 9, it returns the corresponding string from the 'ones' list. If n is in the range 11 to 19, it returns the string representing the teens digit. For the range 10 to 99, the function handles all cases within this range. If the ones digit of n is 0, it returns the string representing the tens digit. Otherwise, it returns the string representation of the tens and ones digits separated by a hyphen. The function accounts for edge cases such as n = 10 and n = 99, ensuring the correct representation of the tens and ones digits for any valid input value of n.
