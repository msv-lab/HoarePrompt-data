Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` takes an integer input `n` representing Tavas's score, and returns the corresponding string representation of the number in English lowercase letters and hyphens. The code covers all possible scenarios for the input integer `n`, including cases where `n` is between 0 and 9, between 11 and 19, and between 10 and 99. The code correctly handles edge cases such as `n = 10` and `n = 99`, ensuring the correct output for all valid inputs. The annotations also confirm that the code covers all the required cases and provides a clear explanation of how the function works. Overall, the code is correct and aligns with the problem description.
