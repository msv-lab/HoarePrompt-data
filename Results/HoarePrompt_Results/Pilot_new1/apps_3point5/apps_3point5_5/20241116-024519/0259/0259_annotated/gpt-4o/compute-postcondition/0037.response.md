According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not provided. Therefore, we need to make sure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time. No other specific states can be adjusted without additional information.
State: **Insufficient information provided to adjust the states for the next iteration**
