Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios including the boundary cases of the variables involved in the if else block.***
