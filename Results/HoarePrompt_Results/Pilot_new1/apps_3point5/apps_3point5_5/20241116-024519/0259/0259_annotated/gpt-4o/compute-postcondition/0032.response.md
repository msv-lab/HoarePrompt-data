Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if else block.***
