Example Answer:
The tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are obtained from the input after splitting it. The list `buses` now contains the tuple `(s, d)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
