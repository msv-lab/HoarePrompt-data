Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts three parameters: n, t, and bus_routes. It iterates through the bus_routes list to calculate the minimum wait time for each route based on the conditions provided. The function then returns the index of the chosen bus route with the minimum wait time. If n is 0 or the bus_routes list is empty, the function will return -1 as the chosen route index.**
