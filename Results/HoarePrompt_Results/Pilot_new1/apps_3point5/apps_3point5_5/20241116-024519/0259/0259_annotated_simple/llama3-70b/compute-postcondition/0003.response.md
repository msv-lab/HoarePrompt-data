Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The values of `s` and `d` depend on the input provided. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split into integers.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split into integers**
