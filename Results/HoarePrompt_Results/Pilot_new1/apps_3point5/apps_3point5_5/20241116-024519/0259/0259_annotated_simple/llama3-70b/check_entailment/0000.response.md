Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station.
2. It then reads the arrival time and interval for each bus route and stores them in a list of tuples.
3. The program calculates the time Serval would have to wait for each bus route based on the current time and the arrival time and interval of each route.
4. It then determines the bus route that Serval will use by finding the route with the minimum waiting time.
5. The program outputs the index of the chosen bus route correctly.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
