Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time. `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`. `i` is incremented by 1. `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This ensures that `wait_time` is correctly calculated based on the conditions and the variables are updated accordingly after the execution of the if else block, covering all possible edge cases.***
