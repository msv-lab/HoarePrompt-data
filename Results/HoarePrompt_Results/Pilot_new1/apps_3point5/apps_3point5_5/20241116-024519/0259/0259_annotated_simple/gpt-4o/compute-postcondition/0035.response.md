Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is unknown. The value of `min_wait_time` is previously assigned the value of `wait_time`, which is also unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`**
