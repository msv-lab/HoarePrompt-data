Example Answer: 
`wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, where `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i` are values based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list. The values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` are not affected by this calculation. 
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time, `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list**
