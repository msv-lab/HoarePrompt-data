The function func_1 accepts parameters n, t, and bus_routes. It iterates through the bus_routes list to calculate the minimum waiting time for each route based on the current time t. After the loop execution, it returns the route number of the bus with the minimum waiting time. If n is 0, the function will not execute the loop, and it will return -1 as the chosen route and positive infinity as the minimum waiting time. The function accurately determines the route with the minimum waiting time based on the provided conditions.
