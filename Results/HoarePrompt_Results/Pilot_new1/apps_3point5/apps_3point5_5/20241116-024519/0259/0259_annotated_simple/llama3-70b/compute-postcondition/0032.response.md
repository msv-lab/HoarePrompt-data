Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute for each tuple in buses. For each iteration, it calculates the time based on the current tuple's values of s and d. If the calculated time is less than the current min_time, it updates min_time to the new time value and updates ans to i + 1. After the loop finishes, min_time will contain the minimum time calculated, ans will contain the corresponding index of the tuple with the minimum time, and i will be the index of the last tuple processed. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and buses remains an empty list, min_time is positive infinity, and ans is -1.**
