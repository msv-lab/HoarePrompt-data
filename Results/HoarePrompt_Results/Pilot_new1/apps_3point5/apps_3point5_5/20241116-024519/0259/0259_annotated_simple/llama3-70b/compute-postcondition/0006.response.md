Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `s` and `d` are now updated based on the input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split into integers.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split into integers**
