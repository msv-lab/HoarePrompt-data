Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time. `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, where `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1` if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`. The variables `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are updated as described in the precondition. If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This ensures that the program correctly handles all possible edge cases related to the calculation of `wait_time` and the updating of variables after the execution of the if else block.***
