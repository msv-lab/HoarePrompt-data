Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, where `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `s_i` and `d_i` are not provided, so the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
