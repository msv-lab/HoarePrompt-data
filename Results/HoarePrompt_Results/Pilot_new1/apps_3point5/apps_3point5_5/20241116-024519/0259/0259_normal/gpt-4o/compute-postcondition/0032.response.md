Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `i`, `wait_time` are all updated based on loop calculations and assignments. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. The program maintains the updated values of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
