Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition (t - s_i) % d_i == 0 is true, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`, ensuring the correct calculation of `wait_time` in each case.***
