Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes. `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time incremented by 1. `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If the condition `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0` is true, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`, ensuring the correct calculation of `wait_time` in each case, including edge cases such as `s_i` being equal to `t`, the modulo condition being satisfied, and generic cases. After the execution of the if else block, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_wait_time` and `wait_time`. `chosen_route` is updated to the index of the bus route with the new minimum `wait_time` incremented by 1.***
