Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum positions in the array and calculates the distances between the minimum and maximum elements and the ends of the array. It then calculates the maximum possible distance by considering all possible scenarios after swapping either the minimum or maximum elements with the ends of the array. The maximum distance is then printed, which is the correct output as per the problem description. 

The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap.
