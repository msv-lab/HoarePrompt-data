Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the integer `n` in the list `a` and assigns it to `posn`. Since `n` is an integer from 2 to 100 and `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of `n` in `a` will be a valid index. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is the index of n in list a.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is the index of n in list a**
