Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is restricted to be between 2 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive).
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive)**
