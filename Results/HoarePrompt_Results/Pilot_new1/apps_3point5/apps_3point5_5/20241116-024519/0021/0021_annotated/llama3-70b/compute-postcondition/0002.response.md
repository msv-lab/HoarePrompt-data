Example Answer:
The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the element 1 in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, and 1 is the first element in the list, the index of 1 in the list `a` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0**
