Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array, calculates the distance between them, and then determines the maximum possible distance by considering the swap of elements. The logic provided in the program covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
