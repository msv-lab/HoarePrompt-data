Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the element `n` in list `a`. Since `n` is the maximum value in the list, `max_pos` will be the index of `n` in list `a`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `min_pos` is the minimum position of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `min_pos` is the minimum position of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`**
