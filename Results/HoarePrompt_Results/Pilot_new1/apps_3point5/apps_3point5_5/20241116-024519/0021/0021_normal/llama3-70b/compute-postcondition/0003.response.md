Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the integer `n` in the list `a` and assigns it to `posn`. Since `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the index of `n` in the list `a` will be the value of `n` itself minus 1. Therefore, `posn` will be equal to `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is n - 1**
