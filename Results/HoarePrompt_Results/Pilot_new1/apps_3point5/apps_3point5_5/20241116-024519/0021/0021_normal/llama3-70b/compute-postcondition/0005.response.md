Example Answer:
`min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between abs(pos1 - posn) - 1 and n - 2. The value of `pos1` is 0 and the value of `posn` is n - 1. Therefore, `min_dist` will be the minimum value between -1 and n - 2. Since n is between 2 and 100, the minimum value will be -1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is n - 1, `max_dist` is the maximum value between abs(pos1 - posn) - 1 and n - 2, `min_dist` is -1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is n - 1, `max_dist` is the maximum value between abs(pos1 - posn) - 1 and n - 2, `min_dist` is -1**
