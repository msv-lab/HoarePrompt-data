Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the elements 1 and `n` in the list, subtracts 1, and compares it with `n - 2`. It also calculates the minimum distance between the positions of the elements 1 and `n` in the list, subtracts 1, and compares it with `n - 2`. The function then prints the maximum value between the two calculated distances and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
