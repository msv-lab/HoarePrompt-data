Example Answer:
`min_pos` is assigned the index of the element 1 in list `a`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of 1 in list `a` is the minimum position. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`**
