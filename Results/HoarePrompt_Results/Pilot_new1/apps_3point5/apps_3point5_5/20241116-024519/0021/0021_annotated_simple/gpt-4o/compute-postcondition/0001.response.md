Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using the `map` function. The input is assumed to be valid with `n` distinct integers from 1 to n. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n**
