According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to k (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and `seen_remainders` should be adjusted to include all remainders from 1 to k (inclusive).
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` includes all remainders from 1 to k**
