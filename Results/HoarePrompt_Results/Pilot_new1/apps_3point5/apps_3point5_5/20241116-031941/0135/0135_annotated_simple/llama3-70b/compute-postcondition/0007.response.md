Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are values assigned from the input after splitting, `seen` is a set containing the remainder values encountered so far, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`. If the remainder value calculated is already present in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits. The overall state of the program after the if statement executes covers the case where the remainder is in `seen`, leading to the message 'No' being printed and the program exiting.***
