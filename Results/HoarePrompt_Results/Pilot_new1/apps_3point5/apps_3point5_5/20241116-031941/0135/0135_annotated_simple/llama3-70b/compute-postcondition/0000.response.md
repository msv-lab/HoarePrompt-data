Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting them. Since the input is not specified, the exact values of `n` and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting them.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting them**
