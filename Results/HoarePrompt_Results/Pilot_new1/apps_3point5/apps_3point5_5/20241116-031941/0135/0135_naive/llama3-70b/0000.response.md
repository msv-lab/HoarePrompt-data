Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if all the remainders obtained by dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far and exits early if a duplicate remainder is found. The program then prints "Yes" if all remainders are distinct and "No" otherwise. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases where the remainders need to be distinct.
