According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 since `i` is less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 0**
