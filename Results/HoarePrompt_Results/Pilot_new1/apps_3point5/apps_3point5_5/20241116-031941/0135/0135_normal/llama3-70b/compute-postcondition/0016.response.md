Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are input integers and `i` is 3. The value of `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 3. The value of `n` is unknown, and `k` is also not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 3.
Output State: **`n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 3**
