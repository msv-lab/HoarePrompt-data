Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. If the value of `remainder` is already present in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0.
Output State: **`n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
