Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop iterates from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is already in seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop adds the remainder to seen_remainders.**
