According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `i`, `remainder`, `seen` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18; `i` is equal to `k + 1`; `remainder` is the calculated remainder of `n` divided by `i`; `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k + 2`.
State: **`n`, `k`, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, `remainder`, `seen`**
