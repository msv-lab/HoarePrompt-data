Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It checks whether all remainders of dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. The code uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far, and if a remainder is repeated, it returns 'No'. If no repeated remainders are found, it returns 'Yes'. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations provide a clear explanation of the code logic. The examples provided in the problem description align with the expected behavior of the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
