Output State: **If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If k is at least 1, the loop will iterate k times. After each iteration, n, k, i, remainder, and seen are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. i is equal to the current value of k + 1, remainder is the remainder of n divided by i, and seen contains the newly added remainder. If the remainder is already in seen, the program prints 'No' and exits without making any modifications to the variables.**
