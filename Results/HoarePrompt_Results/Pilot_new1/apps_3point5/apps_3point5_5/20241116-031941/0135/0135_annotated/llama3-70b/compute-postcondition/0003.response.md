Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, but the value of `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
