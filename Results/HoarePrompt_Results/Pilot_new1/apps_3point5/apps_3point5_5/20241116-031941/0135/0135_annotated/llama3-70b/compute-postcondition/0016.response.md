Example Answer: 
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, where `i` is equal to `k + 1`. Given that `n`, `k`, and `i` are integers within the specified range, the value of `remainder` is determined accordingly. The newly calculated `remainder` is then added to the `seen` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `i` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18; `i` is equal to `k + 1`; `remainder` is the calculated remainder of `n` divided by `i`; `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `i` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18; `i` is equal to `k + 1`; `remainder` is the calculated remainder of `n` divided by `i`; `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`**
