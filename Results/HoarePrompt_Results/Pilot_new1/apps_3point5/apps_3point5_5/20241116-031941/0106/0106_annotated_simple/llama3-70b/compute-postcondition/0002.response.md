Example Answer:
`a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `a_floor` are affected by this calculation. The initial values of `a` and `m` are obtained from input splitting. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting; `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting; `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula**
