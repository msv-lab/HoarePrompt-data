Output State: **`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are determined based on the locations of `a` and `b`. If `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the absolute difference between `floor_a` and 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**
