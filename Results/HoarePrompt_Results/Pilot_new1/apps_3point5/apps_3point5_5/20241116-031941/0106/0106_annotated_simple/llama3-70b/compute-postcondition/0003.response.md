Example Answer:
`a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided. The value of `a` is obtained from input splitting and `m` and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting. Therefore, the value of `a_block` is determined by the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The states of other variables are not affected by this calculation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting; `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula**
