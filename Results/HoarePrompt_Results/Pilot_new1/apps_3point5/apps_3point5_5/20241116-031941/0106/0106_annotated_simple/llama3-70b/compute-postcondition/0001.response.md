Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers using the `map` function. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting**
