Example Answer:
`b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided using the values of `b`, `m`, and `k`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, and `b_floor`. No other variables are affected by this calculation. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, `a_floor` is a new calculated value based on the input values of `a`, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided.**
