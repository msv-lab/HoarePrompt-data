The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n, m, k, a, b`. The parameters `n, m, k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the apartment numbers, such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a â‰  b. After executing the function body, the program returns the total time calculated based on the values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept positive integers `n, m, k, a, b` representing certain constraints, and calculate and return the total time based on the values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
