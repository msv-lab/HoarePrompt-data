Example Answer:
`floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, where `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `block` is a positive integer, `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.
Output State: **`block` is a positive integer, `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`**
