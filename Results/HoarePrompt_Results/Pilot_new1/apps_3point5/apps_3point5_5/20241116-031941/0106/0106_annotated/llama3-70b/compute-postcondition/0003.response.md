Example Answer:
`a_block` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`. The formula calculates the block number based on the given values. The value of `a_block` is determined by dividing `a - 1` by the product of `m` and `k`, then adding 1 to the result. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, `a_floor` is a new calculated value based on the input values of `a`, and `a_block` is calculated using the formula provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, `a_floor` is a new calculated value based on the input values of `a`, and `a_block` is calculated based on the formula**
