Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The value of `a` can be any input integer, `m` is a given integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, `a_floor` will be the remainder of `(a - 1)` when divided by `m`, plus 1. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`**
