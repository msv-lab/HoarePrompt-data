Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `a` and `m` are input integers, `k` is an integer between 1 and 1000. `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. After execution, the value of `a_block` is calculated based on the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values**
