Example Answer:
`b_floor` is assigned the value `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `b`, `m`, and `a` are given as input integers, so `b_floor` is calculated based on these values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values, `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values, `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values**
