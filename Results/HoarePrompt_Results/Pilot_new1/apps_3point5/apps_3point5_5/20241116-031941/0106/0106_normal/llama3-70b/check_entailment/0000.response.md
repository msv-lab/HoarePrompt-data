Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input values for n, m, k, a, and b, and correctly calculates the floor and block numbers for a and b based on the input values.
- It then computes the minimum block time and minimum floor time based on the calculated values.
- The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases, including handling the movement between blocks and floors correctly.
- The output is the total time for block and floor movements, which aligns with the problem description. Overall, the code appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
