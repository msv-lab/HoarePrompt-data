Example Answer:
`time_to_target_floor` is calculated using the formula provided based on the value of `floor_b`. The value of `floor_b` is used in the formula to calculate `time_to_target_floor`. Therefore, the Output State is: Dependent on the values of `block_a` and `block_b`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated using a specific formula, where `time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5`.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `block_a` and `block_b`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated using a specific formula, where `time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5**
