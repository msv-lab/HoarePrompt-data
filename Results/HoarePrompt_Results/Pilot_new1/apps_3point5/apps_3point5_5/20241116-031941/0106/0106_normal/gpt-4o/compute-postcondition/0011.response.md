Example Answer:
The `total_time` is calculated by adding `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The value of `time_to_target_floor` is determined by the formula provided. Therefore, the output state is: `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and the calculated `time_to_target_floor`.
Output State: **`total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and the calculated `time_to_target_floor`**
