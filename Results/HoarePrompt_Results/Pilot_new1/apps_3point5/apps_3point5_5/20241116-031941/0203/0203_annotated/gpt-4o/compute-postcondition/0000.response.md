Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `votes` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters**
