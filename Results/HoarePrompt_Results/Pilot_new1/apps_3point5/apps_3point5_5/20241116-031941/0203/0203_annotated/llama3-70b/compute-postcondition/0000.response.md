Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` represents the number of employees, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats. The input characters represent the fractions of the employees. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats**
