Example Answer: 
The code pops the first element from the d_queue, which contains the indices of 'D' characters in votes. If d_queue is not empty, the value popped is assigned to d_index. If d_queue is empty, an error will occur. Therefore, the Output State is: If votes is an empty string, both d_queue and r_queue remain empty. If votes contains at least one 'D' or 'R' character, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in votes, and d_index is assigned the value popped from d_queue.
