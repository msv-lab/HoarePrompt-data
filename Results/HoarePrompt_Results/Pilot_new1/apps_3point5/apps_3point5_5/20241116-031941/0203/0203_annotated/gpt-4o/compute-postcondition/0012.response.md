Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `r_queue`, which means `i` is added to the end of the `r_queue`. The previous state of the `r_queue` is unknown, so after execution, the `r_queue` will have `i` appended to it.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters with at least 1 character, d_queue and r_queue are updated accordingly, `r_queue` has `i` appended to it**
