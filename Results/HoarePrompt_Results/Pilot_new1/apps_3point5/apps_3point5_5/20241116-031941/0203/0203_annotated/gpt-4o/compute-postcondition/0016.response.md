Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `r_queue`. The previous state of `r_queue` is unknown, so after execution, the `r_queue` will contain the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n+1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue and r_queue are updated accordingly based on the values of v in the input string votes, and `r_queue` contains the value of `i`.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n+1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue and r_queue are updated accordingly based on the values of v in the input string votes, and `r_queue` contains the value of `i`**
