According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `d_queue` is either [3, 2, 2 + n] or [3, 2 + n] and `r_queue` is updated with the result of r_index + n. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` remain 2 and 5 respectively.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **d_queue is either [3, 2, 2 + n] or [3, 2 + n] and r_queue is updated with the result of r_index + n, d_index is 2, r_index is 5**.
