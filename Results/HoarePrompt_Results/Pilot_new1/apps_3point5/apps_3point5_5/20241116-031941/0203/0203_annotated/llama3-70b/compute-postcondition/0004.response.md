According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the start, depublicans and remocrats are both 0. So for the loop to be executed, the fractions list must have at least 1 element, and fraction is the first element in the list.
State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats, fractions is assigned the input value, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 0, fractions list has at least 1 element, fraction is the first element in the list**
