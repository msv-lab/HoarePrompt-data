Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `d_queue`. The `d_queue` now contains the updated values. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters with at least 1 character, d_queue and r_queue are updated accordingly.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters with at least 1 character, d_queue and r_queue are updated accordingly**
