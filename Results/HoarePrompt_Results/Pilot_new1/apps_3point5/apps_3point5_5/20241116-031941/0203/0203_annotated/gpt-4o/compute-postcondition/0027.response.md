According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute again are as follows:
1. If `votes` is an empty string, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty.
2. If `votes` contains at least one 'D' or 'R' character.
3. After the loop executes, `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`.
4. `d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`.
5. `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`.
6. If `d_index` < `r_index`, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`.
7. If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`.

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **If votes is an empty string, both d_queue and r_queue remain empty. If votes contains at least one 'D' or 'R' character, r_queue contains the indices of 'R' characters in votes, d_index is assigned the value popped from d_queue, r_index is assigned the value popped from r_queue, and either d_index < r_index or r_queue is not empty.**
