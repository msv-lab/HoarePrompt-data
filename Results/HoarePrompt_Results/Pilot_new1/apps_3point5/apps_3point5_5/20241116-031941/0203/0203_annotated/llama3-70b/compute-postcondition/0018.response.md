According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the fractions list has at least 3 elements, and fraction is the third element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 elements and fraction is the fourth element in the list. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees. If fraction is 'D', depublicans is incremented by 1; if fraction is 'R', remocrats is incremented by 1. In all cases, only one of depublicans or remocrats is increased by 1 based on the value of fraction. The fractions list has at least 4 elements, and fraction is the fourth element in the list.**
