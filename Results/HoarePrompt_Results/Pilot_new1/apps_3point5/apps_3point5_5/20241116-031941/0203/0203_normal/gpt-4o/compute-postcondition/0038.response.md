Postcondition: ***If `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists, `d_index` is the first index from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is updated based on the popped value from `r_queue`, then after the execution of the if-else block, if `d_index` is less than the updated `r_index`, `d_queue` is appended with the value of `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is appended with the value of `r_index + n`. `r_index` is updated by popping the first element from `r_queue`. In either case, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated with the respective values, ensuring that the logic handles all possible edge cases related to the indices and queues.***
