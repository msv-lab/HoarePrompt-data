Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` represents the number of employees, the input should be a positive integer. Therefore, after execution, `n` will hold a positive integer value representing the number of employees.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees**
