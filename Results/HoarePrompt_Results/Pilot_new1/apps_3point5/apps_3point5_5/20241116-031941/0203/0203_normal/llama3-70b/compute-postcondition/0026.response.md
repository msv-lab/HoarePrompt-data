Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string of fractions representing employees as 'D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' fractions. If the count of 'D' fractions is greater than the count of 'R' fractions, it prints 'D'. Otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not return any specific output.**
