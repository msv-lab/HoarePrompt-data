Output State: 
If `fractions` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. 
If `fractions` contains at least one character, the loop iterates through each character in `fractions`. For each character, if it is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1; if it is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1. 
After the loop executes, `depublicans` contains the count of 'D' fractions, `remocrats` contains the count of non-'D' fractions, and `n` remains a positive integer. 
Output State: **If fractions is empty then depublicans and remocrats are 0. If fractions is not empty then depublicans is the count of 'D' fractions, remocrats is the count of non-'D' fractions, n is a positive integer.**
