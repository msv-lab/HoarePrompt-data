Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` represents the number of employees. The state of the variable `votes` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees. `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fractions of the employees.**
