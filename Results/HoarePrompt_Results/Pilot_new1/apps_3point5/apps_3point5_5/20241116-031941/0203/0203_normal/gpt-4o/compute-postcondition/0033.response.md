According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the key states are `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `d_index`, `r_index`. For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. If `d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` must also not be empty.
2. If `d_index` is less than the updated `r_index`, then `d_queue` should be appended with the value of `d_index + n`.
3. If `d_index` is not less than the updated `r_index`, then `r_queue` should be appended with the value of `r_index + n`.
4. `r_index` should be updated by popping the first element from `r_queue`.

State: **If `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists, `d_index` is the first index from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is updated based on the popped value from `r_queue`, after the execution of the if-else block, if `d_index` is less than the updated `r_index`, `d_queue` is appended with the value of `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is appended with the value of `r_index + n`. `r_index` is updated by popping the first element from `r_queue`.**
