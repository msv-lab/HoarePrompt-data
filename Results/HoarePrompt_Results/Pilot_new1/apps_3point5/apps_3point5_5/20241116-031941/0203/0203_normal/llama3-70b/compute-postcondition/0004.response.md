According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `fractions`. If the string `fractions` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string input, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `fractions` should have at least one character, and `fraction` should be the first character in the string `fractions`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string input with at least one character, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character in `fractions`**
