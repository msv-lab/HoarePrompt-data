Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+2. If the character in `votes` corresponding to the index `i` is 'D', then `d_queue` has an additional element `i`, and `r_queue` remains unchanged. If the character is not 'D', then `r_queue` has an additional element `i`, and `d_queue` remains unchanged. In both cases, the lists `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated based on the character in `votes` at index `i`.***
