Postcondition: ***If fractions is empty, depublicans and remocrats are both 0. If fractions is not empty, depublicans is the count of 'D' fractions, remocrats is the count of non-'D' fractions, and n is a positive integer. In the case where the number of 'D' fractions is greater than the number of non-'D' fractions, the program prints 'D'. If the count of 'D' fractions is less than or equal to the count of non-'D' fractions, the program prints 'R'.***
