According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` list. If the list has at least 2 fractions, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the first fraction in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 fractions and the `fraction` should be the second fraction in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, input characters are either 'D' or 'R', `depublicans` is 1 if the value of `fraction` is 'D', otherwise `remocrats` is 1, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 2 fractions, `fraction` is the second fraction in the list**
