Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty list `r_queue`. This code does not affect the variables `n`, `votes`, or `d_queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is an empty list, r_queue is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is an empty list, r_queue is an empty list**
