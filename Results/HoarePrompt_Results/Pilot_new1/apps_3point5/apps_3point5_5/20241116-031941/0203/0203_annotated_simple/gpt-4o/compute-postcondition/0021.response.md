Example Answer:
The value at index 0 is removed from the r_queue and assigned to r_index. The previous values of r_queue and d_queue are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping), r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed.
Output State: **d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping), r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed**
