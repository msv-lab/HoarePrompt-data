Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, input characters are either 'D' or 'R', `depublicans` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `fraction`, `remocrats` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `fraction`, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 2 fractions, and `fraction` is the second fraction in the list. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1; otherwise, `remocrats` is increased by 1. The final values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` depend on the initial values and the value of `fraction` being 'D' or 'R'.***
