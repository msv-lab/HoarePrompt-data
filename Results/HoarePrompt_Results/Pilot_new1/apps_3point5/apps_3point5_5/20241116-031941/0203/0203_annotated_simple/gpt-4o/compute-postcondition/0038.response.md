Postcondition: ***d_queue will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters with the new value of `d_index + n` appended if d_index is less than r_index. Otherwise, r_queue will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters with the new appended value of `r_index + n`. In both cases, r_index is the index of the 'R' character that was removed, and d_index is either greater than or equal to r_index. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios where either the if or else part is executed based on the relationship between d_index and r_index.***
