Example Answer:
`remocrats` is assigned the value 0. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, the input characters are either 'D' or 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the input characters are either 'D' or 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
