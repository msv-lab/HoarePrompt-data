Example Answer:
`i` is appended to `d_queue`, and `i` is 1. Since `d_queue` is adjusted based on the next character in `votes`, the specific content of `d_queue` cannot be determined without knowing the next character in `votes`. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer, votes is a non-empty string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is adjusted based on the next character in votes, r_queue remains unchanged, i is 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a non-empty string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is adjusted based on the next character in votes, r_queue remains unchanged, i is 1**
