Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The input is assumed to be a positive integer, so `n` will hold a positive integer value. The characters 'D' or 'R' are not directly affected by this code snippet. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the input characters are either 'D' or 'R'**
