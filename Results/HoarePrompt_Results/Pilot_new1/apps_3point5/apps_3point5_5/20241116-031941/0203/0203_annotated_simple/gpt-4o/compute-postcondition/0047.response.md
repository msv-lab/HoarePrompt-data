Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and a string `votes` of length `n`. It then populates two queues `d_queue` and `r_queue` with the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters respectively from the `votes` string. It iterates through both queues, updating the indices based on comparisons until one queue becomes empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if `d_queue` is not empty, otherwise it prints 'R'. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
