According to the code, the loop will execute T times. At the end of the last iteration, T, n, and x are positive integers. The loop will execute again if T is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, T needs to be adjusted to T is greater than 1.
State: **T is greater than 1, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer**
