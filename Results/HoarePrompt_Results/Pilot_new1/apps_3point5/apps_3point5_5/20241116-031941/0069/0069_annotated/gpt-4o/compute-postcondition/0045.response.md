Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`. The values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`**
