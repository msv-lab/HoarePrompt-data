Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input, and the balance is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. The balance is not equal to x. If the difference between x and balance is divisible by the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, the program prints -1. Otherwise, if the result of the division between `(x - balance)` and `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is not an integer, the program prints the result of the division plus 1.***
