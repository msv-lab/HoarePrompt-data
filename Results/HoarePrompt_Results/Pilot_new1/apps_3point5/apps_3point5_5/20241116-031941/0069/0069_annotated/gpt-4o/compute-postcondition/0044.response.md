Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1. The value of `index` is not provided, so the exact value of `x` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1**
