Example Answer:
`count` is appended to the `results` list. The value of `count` is the total count of elements in `prefix_balances` where the difference between `x` and the element is divisible by `balance` and the quotient is non-negative. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`count` is appended to `results` list**
