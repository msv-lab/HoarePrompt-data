Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `x`, `s`, `index`, `n` are updated based on loop iterations. `count` is an integer, initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 if the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` is met. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case `prefix_balances` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros. `results` list has the count appended to it.**
