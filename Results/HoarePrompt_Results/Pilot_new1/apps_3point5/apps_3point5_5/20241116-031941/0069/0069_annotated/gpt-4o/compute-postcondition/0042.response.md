According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 0. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **No adjustments needed, the loop can execute again**
