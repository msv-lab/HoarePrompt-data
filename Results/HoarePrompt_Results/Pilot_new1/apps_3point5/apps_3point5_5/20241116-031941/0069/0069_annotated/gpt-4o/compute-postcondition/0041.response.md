Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of the balances in the list `s`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. If `balance` is 0, then the `prefix_balances` list remains unchanged. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to the `results` list. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `0` is appended to the `results` list. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` where the difference between `x` and an element in `prefix_balances` is divisible by `balance` and the result is non-negative. This count is then appended to the `results` list.***
