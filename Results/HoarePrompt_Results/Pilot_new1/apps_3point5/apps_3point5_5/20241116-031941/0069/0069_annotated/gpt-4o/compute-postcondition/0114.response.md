Example Answer:
The value of `count` representing the total number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions is appended to the `results` list. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the total number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions. If `prefix_balances` is empty, `count` is 0. Ensure `balance` is not 0 and handle negative values appropriately.
Output State: **`count` is the total number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions. If `prefix_balances` is empty, `count` is 0. Ensure `balance` is not 0 and handle negative values appropriately.**
