Example Answer:
The list `prefix_balances` is initialized with `n + 1` zeros. The value of `n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`, the value of `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1, the value of `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, and the value of `index` is incremented by 3. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, and `index` is incremented by 3.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, and `index` is incremented by 3**
