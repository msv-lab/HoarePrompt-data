Example Answer: 
`n` and `x` are assigned values by mapping integers from input split by space. The values of `n` and `x` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input**
