Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' characters in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' characters in string `s`. The balance is not equal to `x`. If the difference between `x` and balance is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of the expression (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This covers all possible scenarios of the program execution.***
