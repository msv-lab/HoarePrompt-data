Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' characters in the string `s` respectively. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are updated based on the input string `s`, while the values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is n + 2, `x` is updated based on input, `s` is assigned the input value, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are updated based on the count of '0' and '1' characters in `s`.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is n + 2, `x` is updated based on input, `s` is assigned the input value, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are updated based on the count of '0' and '1' characters in `s`**
