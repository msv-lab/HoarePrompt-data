Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data, processes it based on specific conditions, and prints the results. It iterates through the input data, calculates balances, and appends results based on certain conditions. If the balance is 0, it checks if a certain value is in the calculated balances; otherwise, it counts elements that meet specific criteria and appends the count to the results. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
