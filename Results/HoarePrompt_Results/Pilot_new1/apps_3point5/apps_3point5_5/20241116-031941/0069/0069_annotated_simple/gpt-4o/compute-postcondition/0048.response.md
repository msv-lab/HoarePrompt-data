Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances based on the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, `T` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1'), and `prefix_balances` is now a list of zeros with a length of `(n + 1)`**
