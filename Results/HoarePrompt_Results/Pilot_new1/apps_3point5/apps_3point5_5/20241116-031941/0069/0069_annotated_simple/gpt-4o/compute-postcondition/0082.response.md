Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, where `data` is a list and `index` is increased by 3. The value of `s` depends on the content of `data` at index + 2. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` list may have been updated, `x` is an integer, `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` list may have been updated, `x` is an integer, `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value**
