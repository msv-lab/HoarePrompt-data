Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances based on the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, T is greater than 0, n, x, and results remain unchanged, balance is updated, `i` is the index of the current iteration, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at position `i - 1` in string `s`. If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. Additionally, `balance` is updated based on the conditions in the if else block. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to the `results` list. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, 0 is appended to the `results` list.***
