Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string.
2. It calculates the number of 0s and 1s in the string and then calculates the balance.
3. It checks if the balance is equal to the desired balance, prints the length of the string + 1.
4. If the difference between the desired balance and the calculated balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of 0s and 1s, it prints -1.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes needed to achieve the desired balance and prints that.
6. The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each test case.
