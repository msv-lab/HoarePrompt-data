Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' characters in string `s` respectively. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are dependent on the input string `s`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`**
