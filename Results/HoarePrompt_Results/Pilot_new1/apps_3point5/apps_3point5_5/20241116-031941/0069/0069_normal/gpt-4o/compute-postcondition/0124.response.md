According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If the list has at least 4 results, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list of at least 3 results and the next result after the printed result is selected. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 4 results and the next result after the printed result is selected.
State: **`results` is a list of at least 4 results and the next result after the printed result is selected**
