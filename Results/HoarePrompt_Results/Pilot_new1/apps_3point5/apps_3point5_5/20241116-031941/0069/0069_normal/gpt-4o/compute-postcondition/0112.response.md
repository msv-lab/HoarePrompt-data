According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `prefix_balances`. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` has at least 3 elements, and `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 4 elements and `b` must be the fourth element in `prefix_balances`.
State: **count is an integer. If (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, count is increased by 1. The list prefix_balances has at least 4 elements, and b is the fourth element in prefix_balances.**
