The function `func_1` reads input for the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of a binary string `n`, a desired balance `x`, and the binary string `s`. It then calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in `s` and stores the results in `prefix_balances`. Based on the conditions, it appends either -1 or 0 to the `results` list for each test case. The function does not return any value.
