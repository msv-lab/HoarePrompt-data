Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `data[index + 2]`. The value of `data[index + 2]` is determined by the input data. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at the corresponding index, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is assigned the integer value from `data[index]`, `T` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at the corresponding index, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is assigned the integer value from `data[index]`, `T` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]**
