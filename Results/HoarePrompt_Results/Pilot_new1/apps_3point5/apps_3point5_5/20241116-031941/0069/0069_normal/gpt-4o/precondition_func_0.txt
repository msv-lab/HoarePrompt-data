**Precondition**: 
- $T$ is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - $n$ is a positive integer representing the length of the binary string $s$.
  - $x$ is an integer representing the desired balance such that $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$.
  - $s$ is a binary string of length $n$ where each character is either '0' or '1'.
