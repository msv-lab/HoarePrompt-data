Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length (n + 2) filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `T` is greater than 0, `s` is the value from `data[index + 5], `index` is incremented by 6, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated with the new value calculated by `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
