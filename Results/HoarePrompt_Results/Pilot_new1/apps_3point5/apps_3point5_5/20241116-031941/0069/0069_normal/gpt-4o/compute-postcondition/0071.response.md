Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of non-zero elements with a length greater than or equal to 2, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` incremented by 3, and the balance is not equal to 0. If both conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) are met, then `count` is further incremented by 1.***
