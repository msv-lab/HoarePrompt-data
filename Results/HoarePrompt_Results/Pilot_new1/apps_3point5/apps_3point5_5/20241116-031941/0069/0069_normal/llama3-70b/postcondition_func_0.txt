The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input, then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, and calculates the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`. It then determines the balance between '0' and '1' counts. Depending on the balance compared to `x`, it prints different values. If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If the difference between `x` and the balance divided by the difference in counts is divisible, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the division result plus 1. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
