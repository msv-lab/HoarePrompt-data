According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already executed at least once. So, the value of `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in the binary string `s` and stores the result in `prefix_balances`. `n` is greater than 1**
