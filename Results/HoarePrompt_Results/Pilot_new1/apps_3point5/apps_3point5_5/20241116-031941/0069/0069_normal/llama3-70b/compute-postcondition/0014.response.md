Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If the balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This postcondition covers all scenarios including the equality of balance and x, the modulo condition being satisfied, and the default else case.***
