**Precondition**: 
- The input consists of $T$ test cases, where $1 \le T \le 100$.
- For each test case:
  - $n$ is the length of the binary string $s$, where $1 \le n \le 10^5$.
  - $x$ is the desired balance of prefixes, where $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$.
  - The binary string $s$ has a length of $n$ and consists of only 0-s and 1-s.
- The total sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.
