Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly reads the input, sorts the sequence of integers, and then iterates through the sequence to determine the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. The logic used to calculate the minimum number of variables is correct, as it checks if the current element in the sorted sequence is equal to twice the previous element. If not, it increments the count of variables required. The program also correctly handles the edge case where the number of variables required exceeds 23, returning -1 as specified in the problem description. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
