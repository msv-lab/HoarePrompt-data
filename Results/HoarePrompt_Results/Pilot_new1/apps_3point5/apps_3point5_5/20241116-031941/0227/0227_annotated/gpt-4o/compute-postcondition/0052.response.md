Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If the element at index `i` in list `a` subtracted by `x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True, `m` is increased by 1, and the loop is broken. The assigned list contains at least one element, and `x` is the first element in the assigned list. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the variables.***
