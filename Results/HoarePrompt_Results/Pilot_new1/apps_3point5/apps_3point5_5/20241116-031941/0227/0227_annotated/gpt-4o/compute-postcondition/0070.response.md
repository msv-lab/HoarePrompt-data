The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of elements in list `a` that could not be formed by the difference of any two elements in the list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the difference of any two elements in the list.
