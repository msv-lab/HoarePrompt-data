Postcondition: ***If the element at index `i` in list `a` minus `x` is found in the `assigned` list, `can_form` is set to True and the loop terminates. If `assigned` is not empty, the loop executes at least once. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. After the if-else block, `m` is increased by 1 and `can_form` remains False.***
