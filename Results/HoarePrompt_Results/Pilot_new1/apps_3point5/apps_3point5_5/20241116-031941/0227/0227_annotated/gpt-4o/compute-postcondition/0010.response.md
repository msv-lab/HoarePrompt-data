Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least one element, `m` is 1, `i` is 1. If the element at index `i` in list `a` minus `x` is present in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
