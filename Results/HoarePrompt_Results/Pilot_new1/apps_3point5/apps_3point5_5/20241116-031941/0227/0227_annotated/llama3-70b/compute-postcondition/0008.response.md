According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not double the element at index `i - 1`, then `m` is increased by 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
