Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is met, `can_form` is set to True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least one element, and the loop or if statement is terminated. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, `m` is increased by 1, and `assigned` still contains at least one element.***
