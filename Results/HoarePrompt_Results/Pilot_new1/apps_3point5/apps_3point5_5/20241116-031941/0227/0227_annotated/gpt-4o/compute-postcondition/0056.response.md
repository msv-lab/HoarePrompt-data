Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If a[i] - x is present in the assigned list, then `can_form` is set to True, `m` is increased by 1, and `x` is updated to the next element in the assigned list. The program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If a[i] - x is not found in the assigned list, there is no change in the values of `can_form`, `m`, and `x`.***
