Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The list `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers, so after sorting, the list `a` remains the same but in ascending order. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9)**
