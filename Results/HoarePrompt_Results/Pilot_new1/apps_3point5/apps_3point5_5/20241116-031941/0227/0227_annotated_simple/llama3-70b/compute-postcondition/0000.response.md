Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 23. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23. `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
