Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since the values in list `a` are distinct positive integers, the sorting operation rearranges the elements in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
