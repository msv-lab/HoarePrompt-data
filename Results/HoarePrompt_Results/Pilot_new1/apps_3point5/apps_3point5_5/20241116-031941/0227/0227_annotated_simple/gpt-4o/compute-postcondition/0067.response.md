According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: `can_form` is a boolean indicating whether there exists a pair of elements in `assigned` with a difference equal to `a[i]`. If `can_form` is False and `assigned` is not empty, `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True or `assigned` is empty, `m` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is not added to `assigned`, and `i` remains the same, and `a[i]` is added to `assigned`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `can_form` is False and `assigned` is not empty, `m` should be increased by 1.
- If `can_form` is True or `assigned` is empty, `m` should remain unchanged.
- `a[i]` should be added to `assigned`.
- `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`can_form` is a boolean, `assigned` may or may not be empty, `m` may or may not be increased by 1, `a[i]` is added to `assigned`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
