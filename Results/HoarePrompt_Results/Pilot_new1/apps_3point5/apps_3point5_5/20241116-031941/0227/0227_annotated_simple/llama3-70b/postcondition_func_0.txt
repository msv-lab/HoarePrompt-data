The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list and iterates through it to count the number of elements that are not twice the value of the previous element. If this count is less than or equal to 23, it prints the count; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value.
