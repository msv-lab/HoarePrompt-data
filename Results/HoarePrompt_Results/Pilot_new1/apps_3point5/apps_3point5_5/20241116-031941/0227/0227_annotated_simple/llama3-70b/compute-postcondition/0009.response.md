Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, the element at index `i` in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index `i-1`, `m` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, the element at index `i` in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index `i-1`, `m` is increased by 1**
