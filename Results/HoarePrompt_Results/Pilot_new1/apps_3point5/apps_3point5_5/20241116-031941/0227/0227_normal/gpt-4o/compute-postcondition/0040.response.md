According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `assigned` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `m` is 2, `x` is the second element in `assigned`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `assigned` must contain at least 3 elements and `x` should be the third element in `assigned`.
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged**
