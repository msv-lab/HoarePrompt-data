Example Answer: 
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. As `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, sorting it will reorder the elements in ascending order. No new variables are introduced or existing variables changed, only the order of elements in the list is modified. Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
