According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Also, the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Before the loop starts, `m` is 1, so it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
