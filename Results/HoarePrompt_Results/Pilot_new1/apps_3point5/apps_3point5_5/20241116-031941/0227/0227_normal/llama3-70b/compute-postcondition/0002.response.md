Example Answer: 
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values in the list `a` are rearranged accordingly. The length of the sequence `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the sequence, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the sequence, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
