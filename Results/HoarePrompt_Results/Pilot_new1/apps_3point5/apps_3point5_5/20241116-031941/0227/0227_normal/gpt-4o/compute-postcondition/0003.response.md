Example Answer:
The variable `m` is assigned the value 1. The values of `a` and `assigned` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer from list `a`, `m` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer from list `a`, `m` is 1**
