Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements. `assigned` may or may not contain the current element `x`. `m` is increased by 1. `n` remains greater than 2. `i` remains less than `n-1`. If the difference between `a[i]` and any element `x` in `assigned` is found, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If no such difference is found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False after the loop execution. If `assigned` is empty or does not contain any element `x`, the loop will not execute, and `can_form` will remain False.***
