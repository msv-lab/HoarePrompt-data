Example Answer: 
The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, element at index 1 in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index 0, `m` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, element at index 1 in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index 0, `m` is an integer**
