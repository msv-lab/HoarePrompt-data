Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `assigned` is not empty and does not contain the current element `x`, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n-1`, `can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in the `assigned` list. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. This postcondition covers all edge cases and ensures the correctness of the program after the if statement execution.***
