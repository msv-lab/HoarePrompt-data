Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer from list `a` with at least one element and the newly added element `a[i]`, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 2. If there exists an element `a[i] - x` in `assigned` where `x` is an element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False after the loop completes. If `assigned` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False.**
