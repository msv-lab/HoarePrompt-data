Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the MOD value as 1000003. If `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, the function prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, the program updates the values of `numerator`, `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, `A`, and `B` based on a loop that runs `k` times. After the loop, it calls another function `func_1` with `A` and `B` as parameters, updates `A` and `B` based on the result of `func_1`, and then prints the values of `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`.**
