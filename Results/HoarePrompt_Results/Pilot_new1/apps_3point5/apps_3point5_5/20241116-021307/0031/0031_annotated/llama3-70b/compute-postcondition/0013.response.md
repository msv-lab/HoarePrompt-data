Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes, `total_days` remains 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to the result of the product of `(total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2) * ... * (total_days - k) * numerator`, `denominator` is updated to the result of the product of `total_days * (total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2) * ... * (total_days - k + 1)`, `i` is equal to k, k is greater than 0. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1.**
