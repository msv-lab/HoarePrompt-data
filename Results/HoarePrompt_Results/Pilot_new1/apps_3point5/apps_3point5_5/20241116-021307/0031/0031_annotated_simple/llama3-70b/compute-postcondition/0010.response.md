Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`, where `i` is 2. The previous values of the variables are `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1), `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` squared, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. After execution, the new value of `numerator` is the previous value of `numerator` multiplied by (`total_days - i`), where `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1) multiplied by (`total_days - 2`), `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` squared, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1) multiplied by (`total_days - 2`), `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` squared, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
