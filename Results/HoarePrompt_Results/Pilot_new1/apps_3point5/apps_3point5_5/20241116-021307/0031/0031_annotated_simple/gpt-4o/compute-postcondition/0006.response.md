Example Answer:
The variable `numerator` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `total_days` is dependent on the value of `n`, which is not given. The program does not print anything unless `k` is greater than `total_days`. Therefore, the output state is: `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1.
Output State: **`total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1**
