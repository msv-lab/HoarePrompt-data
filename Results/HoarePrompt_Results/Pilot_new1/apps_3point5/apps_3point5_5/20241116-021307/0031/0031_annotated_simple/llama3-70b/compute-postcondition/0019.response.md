Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the remainders of the division of the numerator and denominator after specific operations, and returns those remainders after dividing by (10^6 + 3). The function computes the product of factorials for a given range of values and then finds the greatest common divisor to simplify the fractions before returning the remainders. The code may encounter potential issues if `k` is 0 or negative, which could lead to unexpected results or errors. **
