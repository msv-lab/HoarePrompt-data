The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k, calculates MOD as 1000003. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, it calculates the values of p_no_shared, p_total, p_shared, A, B, and g based on the values of numerator and denominator calculated in the loop. It then calls func_1 with A and B, updates A and B based on the result, and finally prints A % MOD and B % MOD.
