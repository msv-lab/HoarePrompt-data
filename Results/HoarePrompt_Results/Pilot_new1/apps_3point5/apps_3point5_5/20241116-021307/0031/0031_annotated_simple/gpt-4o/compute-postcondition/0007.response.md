Example Answer:
`denominator` is assigned the value `1`, and the other variables `total_days` and `numerator` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1.
Output State: **`total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
