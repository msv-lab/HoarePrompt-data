Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a given scenario.
2. It handles the case where the number of people to be interviewed is greater than the total number of days in a year by printing 1 and 1.
3. The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prints the irreducible fraction as required.
4. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are well-implemented and fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
5. The program logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.
