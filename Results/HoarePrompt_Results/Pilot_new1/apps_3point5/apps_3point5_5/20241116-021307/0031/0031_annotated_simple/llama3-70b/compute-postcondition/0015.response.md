Example Answer:
The `numerator` is divided by `gcd` using the floor division operator `//`. Since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, after execution, the `numerator` is updated to be the result of the division. The value of `gcd` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, `numerator` is updated after division.
Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, `numerator` is updated after division**
