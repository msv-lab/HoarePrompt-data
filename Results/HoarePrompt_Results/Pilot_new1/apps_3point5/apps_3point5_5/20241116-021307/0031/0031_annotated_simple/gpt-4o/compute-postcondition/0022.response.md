Output State: If k is greater than 0, `numerator` is the product of all values from 1 to `total_days` shifted left by `n` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is the product of all values from 1 to `total_days` modulo `MOD`, and `p_no_shared` is `numerator`. If k is 0 or lower, `numerator` and `denominator` are 1. `p_total` is `denominator`. After executing the code snippet, `p_shared` will be assigned the value of `A`.
