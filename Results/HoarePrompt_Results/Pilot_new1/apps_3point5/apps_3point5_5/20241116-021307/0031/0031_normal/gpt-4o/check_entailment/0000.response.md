Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. 
- It handles the case where k is greater than 2^n by printing 1 1 and returning early.
- The output hints also align with the code, providing a clear explanation of how the probability is calculated and reduced to an irreducible fraction.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case mentioned in the problem statement, including edge cases.
