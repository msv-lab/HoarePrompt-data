According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1, numerator has been updated to 1, denominator is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, denominator is updated to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1, numerator has been updated to 1, denominator is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, denominator is updated to 1**
