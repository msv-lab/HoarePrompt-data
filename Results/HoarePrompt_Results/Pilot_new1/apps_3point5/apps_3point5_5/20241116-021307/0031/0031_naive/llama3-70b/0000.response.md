Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland. It uses the formula for calculating the probability and reduces the fraction to its irreducible form. The program also correctly handles taking the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 for large numbers. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
