Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland for the given input values of n and k. It follows the problem description by calculating the probability using the formula provided and then reducing the fraction to its irreducible form. The program also handles the case where k is greater than 2^n by outputting 1 1. The logic and calculations in the program are accurate and align with the problem requirements.
