Example Answer:
x and y are assigned values from the input after splitting it. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space. Since the values of x and y are unknown until the input is provided, the output state will be: x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
