Example Answer: 
The absolute difference between x and y is calculated using the abs() function and then printed. The initial state specifies that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the output state is x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
