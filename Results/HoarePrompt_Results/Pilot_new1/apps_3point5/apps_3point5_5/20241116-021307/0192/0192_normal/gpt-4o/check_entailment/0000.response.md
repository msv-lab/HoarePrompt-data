Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, calculates the result of `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, and prints the result. This logic aligns with the problem description, where Memory needs to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` from a starting side length of `x` by modifying the length of a single side such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` accurately determines the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to achieve the desired triangle length. 

The code handles all potential cases as per the problem description, including the constraints of `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code, ensuring that it produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
