Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the side lengths of the starting and ending equilateral triangles respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between x and y and prints it as the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y.

For all potential cases, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform the equilateral triangle of side length x to y by simply taking the absolute difference between x and y. It follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for all given examples. Hence, the program is correct.
