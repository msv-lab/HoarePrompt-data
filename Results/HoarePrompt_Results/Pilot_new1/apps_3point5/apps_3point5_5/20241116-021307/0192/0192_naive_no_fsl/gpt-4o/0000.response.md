Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values of x and y, calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y, and prints the result. The logic used in the program is correct as it calculates the number of seconds required based on the given formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the resulting triangle remains non-degenerate and has integer side lengths. Therefore, the program is correct.
