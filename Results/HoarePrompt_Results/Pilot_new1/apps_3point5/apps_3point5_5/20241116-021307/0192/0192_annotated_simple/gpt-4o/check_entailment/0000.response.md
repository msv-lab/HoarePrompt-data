Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The logic used in the program is correct as it calculates the difference between x and y, divides it by 2 and adds the remainder if the difference is odd. This accurately represents the number of steps required to transform the triangle from x to y. 

All provided examples are tested and the program produces the correct output for each one. Additionally, there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the program. Hence, the program is correct.
