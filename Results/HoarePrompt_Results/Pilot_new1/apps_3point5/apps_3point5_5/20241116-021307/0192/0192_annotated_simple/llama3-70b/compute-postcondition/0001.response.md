Example Answer:
The absolute difference between `x` and `y` is calculated using the `abs()` function and printed. The previous values of `x` and `y` are the first and second integer inputs, respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, and the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is printed.
Output State: **`x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, and the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is printed**
