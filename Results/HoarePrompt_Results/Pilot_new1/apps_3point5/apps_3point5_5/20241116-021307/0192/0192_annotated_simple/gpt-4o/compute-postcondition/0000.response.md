Example Answer:
The values of x and y are assigned based on the input split by space. Since the input is not specified, the values of x and y can be any integers that satisfy the preconditions. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
