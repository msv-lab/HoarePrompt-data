Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers represented as strings, `a` and `b`, each containing no more than 10^6 digits. It then compares the values of `a` and `b`, and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The code correctly handles cases where `a` and `b` have leading zeroes by using the `lstrip('0')` method to remove any leading zeroes before comparison. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, including when the numbers are equal, when one number is less than the other, and when one number is greater than the other. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the code's functionality.
