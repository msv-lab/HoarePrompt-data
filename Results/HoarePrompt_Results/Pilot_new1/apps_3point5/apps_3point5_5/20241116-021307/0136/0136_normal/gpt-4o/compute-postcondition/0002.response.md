Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed. The value of `data` is a list containing split input values, and `a` is the value at index 0 of `data` with leading zeros removed. After execution, the value of `b` is the same as `data[1]` but with leading zeros removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list containing the split input values, `a` is the value at index 0 of `data` with leading zeros removed, and `b` is the value at index 1 of `data` with leading zeros removed.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, `a` is the value at index 0 of `data` with leading zeros removed, and `b` is the value at index 1 of `data` with leading zeros removed**
