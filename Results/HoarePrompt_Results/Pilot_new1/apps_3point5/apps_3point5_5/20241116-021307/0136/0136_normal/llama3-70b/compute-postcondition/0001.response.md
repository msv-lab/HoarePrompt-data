Example Answer:
The code removes leading zeros from the input string `b` using the `lstrip` function. The value of `b` is updated to the input string without leading zeros. The value of `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros**
