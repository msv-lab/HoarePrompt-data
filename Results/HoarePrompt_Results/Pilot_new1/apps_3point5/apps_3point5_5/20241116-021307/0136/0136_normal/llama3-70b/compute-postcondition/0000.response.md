Example Answer:
The input string `a` is stripped of leading zeros using the `lstrip` method. The value of `a` may change depending on the leading zeros in the input string. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, each containing no more than 10^6 digits.**
