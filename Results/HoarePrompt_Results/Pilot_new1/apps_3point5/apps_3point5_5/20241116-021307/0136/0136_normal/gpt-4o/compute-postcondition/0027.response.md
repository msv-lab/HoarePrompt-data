Functionality: **The function func_1 reads two input values, removes leading zeros from them, and compares them. If the first value is less than the second, it prints '<'. If the first value is greater than the second, it prints '>'. If the values are equal, it prints '='. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, the annotations imply that it should handle cases where the input values are not numeric or where one or both values are empty strings, but the code does not address these scenarios.**
