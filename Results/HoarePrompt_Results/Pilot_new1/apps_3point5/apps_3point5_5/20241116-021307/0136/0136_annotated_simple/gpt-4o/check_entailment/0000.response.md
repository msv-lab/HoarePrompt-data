Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads two very long integers a and b from the input.
2. It removes any leading zeros from both a and b.
3. It compares the lengths of a and b and prints '<' if a is less than b, '>' if a is greater than b, and '=' if they are equal.
4. The program handles all edge cases including when a and b are empty strings or evaluate to False.
5. The program logic aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for all given examples.
