Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('>')` simply prints the greater than symbol ('>'). It does not affect the values of variables `a` and `b` as they are not used in the code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is the input value without leading zeros. `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`**
