Example Answer:
The input is taken and leading zeros are stripped from the input string `a`. The value of `a` can be any non-negative integer represented as a string. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros**
