Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is the input value without leading zeros. `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, then the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the program prints '>'. This covers all possible cases for the comparison between `a` and `b`.***
