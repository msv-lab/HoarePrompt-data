Example Answer:
The print statement outputs '<' to the console. The variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits. If `a` is an empty string, it is assigned the value '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits. If `b` is an empty string or evaluates to False, it is assigned the value '0'. The length of `a` is less than the length of `b`.**
