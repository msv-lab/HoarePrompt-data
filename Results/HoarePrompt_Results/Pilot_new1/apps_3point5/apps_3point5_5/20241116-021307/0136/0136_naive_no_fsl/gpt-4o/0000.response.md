Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two very long integers a and b as a whole line using `input().split()` which is in line with the problem description.
2. It removes leading zeroes from both a and b using `lstrip('0')`.
3. It then compares the lengths of a and b, and if they are not equal, it correctly determines which number is greater or if they are equal, and prints the corresponding symbol ("<", ">", "=") as required by the problem description.
4. The program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and works correctly for all the provided examples.
