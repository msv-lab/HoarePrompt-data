Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as strings and removes any leading zeroes. It then compares the two numbers and prints the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", "=") based on the comparison. The program correctly handles the case where a < b, a > b, and a = b as described in the problem statement. The logic used in the program is correct and covers all potential cases, making the program correct.
