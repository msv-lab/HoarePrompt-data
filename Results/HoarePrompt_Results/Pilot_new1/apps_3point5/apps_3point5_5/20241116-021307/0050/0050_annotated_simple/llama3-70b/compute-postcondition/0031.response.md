Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. If shares > 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If shares <= 0, `shares` remains 0, `r` meets the specified conditions, `i` remains 0, and `m` is still greater than 0. In the else part, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
