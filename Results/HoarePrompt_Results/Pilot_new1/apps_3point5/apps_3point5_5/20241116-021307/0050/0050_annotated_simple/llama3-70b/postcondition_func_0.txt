The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with lists `s` and `b`. It then sorts the lists `s` and `b`. The function iterates through elements in `s` and updates the value of `shares` based on the division of `r` by elements in `s`. It then updates the value of `r` based on elements in `b` if `shares` is greater than 0. The final value of `r` is printed. The function does not have explicit return values.
