Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is multiplied by the value of `b[i]` and added to the current value of `r`. The current value of `shares` is 0, the value of `b[i]` is based on the program's state, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0**
