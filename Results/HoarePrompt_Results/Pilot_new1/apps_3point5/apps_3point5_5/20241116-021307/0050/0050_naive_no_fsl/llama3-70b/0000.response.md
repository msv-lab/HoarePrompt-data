Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the initial amount of bourles.
2. It then reads the prices of buying and selling shares and sorts them accordingly.
3. The program iterates through the buying opportunities and buys as many shares as possible with the available bourles.
4. It then iterates through the selling opportunities and sells all the shares bought, updating the total amount of bourles accordingly.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening.

The program follows the problem description and logic correctly for all potential cases, ensuring that the maximum profit is achieved by buying and selling shares optimally.
