Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are integers greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order, `shares` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.***
