Output State: 
- `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order.
- If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]` for the first iteration, `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks and `shares` remains 0.
- If `r` is between 0 and `s[i] - 1` for the second iteration, `shares` is updated accordingly. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks and `shares` remains the same.
- For the third iteration, if `r >= s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division of `r` by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks and `shares` remains the same.

This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if else block and ensures that `shares` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop.
