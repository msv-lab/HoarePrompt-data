Example Answer:
The variable `shares` is assigned the value of 0. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order, `shares` is 0.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order, `shares` is 0**
