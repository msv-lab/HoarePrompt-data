Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers between 1 and 30, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split and sorted in reverse order, `i` is less than `n + 1. If r >= s[i], `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division of `r` by `s[i]`. If r < s[i], the loop breaks.***
