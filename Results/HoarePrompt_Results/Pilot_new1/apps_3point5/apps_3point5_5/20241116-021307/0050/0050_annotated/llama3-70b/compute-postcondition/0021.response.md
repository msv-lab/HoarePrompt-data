Example Answer:
The `break` statement will break out of the loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables will not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are adjusted based on the condition `r >= s[i]` in the previous iteration.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are adjusted based on the condition `r >= s[i]` in the previous iteration**
