Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from input, followed by two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then sorts the lists `s` and `b`, calculates the number of shares of `r` based on values in `s`, updates `r` and `shares` according to certain conditions, and finally prints the value of `r`. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.**
