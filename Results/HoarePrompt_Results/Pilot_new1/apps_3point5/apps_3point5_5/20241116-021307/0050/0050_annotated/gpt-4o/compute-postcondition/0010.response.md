Example Answer:
The total bourles are calculated by multiplying the maximum shares with the maximum sell price and then adding the remaining bourles. The maximum shares are calculated based on the values of `r` and `min_buy_price`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is calculated based on the values of `r` and `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is an integer representing the remaining bourles after division, and `total_bourles` is the calculated total bourles.
