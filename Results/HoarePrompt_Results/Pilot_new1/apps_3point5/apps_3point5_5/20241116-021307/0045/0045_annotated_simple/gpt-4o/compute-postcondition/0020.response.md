Postcondition: ***All variables remain the same, except the sequence at index i is incremented by 1 and i is decremented by 1. If remainder is 0, the loop or if statement is exited. This encapsulates the scenario where the loop or if statement is exited when the remainder is 0, while all other variables retain their values and the sequence at index i is adjusted accordingly.***
