According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `d`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, sequence is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, range depends on `k` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the starting value of the multiples, and `i` is `k - 1`.
State: **sequence is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, range depends on `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the starting value of the multiples, `i` is `k - 1**.
