According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `sequence` is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, range depends on `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the starting value of the multiples, `i` is 0, `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is 0, the loop or if statement is terminated, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `k` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2, as `k - 1` is the starting point for the loop range.
- `i` needs to be adjusted to be -1, as the loop iterates from `k - 1` to -1.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`sequence` is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, range depends on `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is the starting value of the multiples, `i` is -1, `remainder` is 0**
