Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. If the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `min_sum`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the multiples of `d` starting from `d` and constructs a list `sequence` containing these elements. The function returns this list. Edge cases to consider are when `n` or `k` are 0 or negative, which are not handled explicitly in the function. **
