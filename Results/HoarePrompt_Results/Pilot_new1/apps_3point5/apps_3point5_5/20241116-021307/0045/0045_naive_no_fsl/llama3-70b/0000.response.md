Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input of two integers n and k, representing the sum and the length of the sequence respectively. It then creates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n. The program also ensures that the greatest common divisor of the sequence is maximal.

The program iterates over the range from 1 to k, adding each number to the sequence and subtracting it from n until n is less than the current number. If the resulting sequence is not of length k, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the sequence.

The program logic seems to be correct as it ensures the sequence is strictly increasing, sums up to n, and handles cases where there is no possible sequence by outputting -1. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not follow the problem description.
