Correctness: False

The provided code is a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the code itself does not directly address the problem description of finding a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers whose sum is equal to n and the GCD is maximal.

The annotations provide information about how the function works, but they do not indicate that the function is designed to solve the specific problem described in the prompt. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it does not generate the required sequence of positive numbers with a maximal GCD.
