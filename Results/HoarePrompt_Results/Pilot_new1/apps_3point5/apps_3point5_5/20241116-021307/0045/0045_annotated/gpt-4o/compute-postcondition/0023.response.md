According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, there was no change in the state of the variables, and `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to -1.
State: **No change in the state of the variables, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is greater than or equal to -1**
