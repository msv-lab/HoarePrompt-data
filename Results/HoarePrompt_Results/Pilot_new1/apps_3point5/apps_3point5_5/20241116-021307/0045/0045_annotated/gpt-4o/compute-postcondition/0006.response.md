Example Answer:
The list `sequence` is created by multiplying each index `i` by `d` and adding `1`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `k-1`. No other variables are affected, and there are no function returns. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the state of the variables.
Output State: **No change in the state of the variables**
