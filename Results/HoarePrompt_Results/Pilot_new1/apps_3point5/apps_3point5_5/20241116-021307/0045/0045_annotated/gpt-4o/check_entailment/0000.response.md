Correctness: False

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly handles the case where the sum of the first k positive integers is greater than n and returns -1. However, there is an issue with the logic of constructing the sequence list based on the division of n by min_sum and adjusting the elements in the list based on the remainder.

For example, if we take the input n=5, k=3, the expected output should be -1 since there is no possible sequence that satisfies the conditions. However, the code may produce a sequence such as [1, 2, 2] which does not have a maximal greatest common divisor.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases where there might not exist a valid sequence. The annotations did help in understanding the flow of the code, but they did not accurately reflect the correctness of the code in all cases.
