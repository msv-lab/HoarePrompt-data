Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes two inputs, the string received by Kate and the substring that Vasya remembers. It then iterates through the string received by Kate and only appends the characters that are present in the remembered substring. Finally, it appends the remembered substring to the constructed string and converts it to an integer before printing it.

The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for all potential cases. The logic implemented in the code ensures that the smallest possible initial integer n is found based on the provided inputs.
