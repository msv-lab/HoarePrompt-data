Example Answer:
The value of `n` is increased by the value of `c`, where `c` is the next character in the string `s` and is present in the set `t_set`. The previous value of `n` and the specific value of `c` are unknown, so the output state is: `s` still has characters left to iterate over, the next character `c` in `s` is present in `t_set`, `n` is increased by the value of `c`.
Output State: **`s` still has characters left to iterate over, the next character `c` in `s` is present in `t_set`, `n` is increased by the value of `c`**
