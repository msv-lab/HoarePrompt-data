Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`. The variables `chars`, `perm`, `sub`, and `candidate` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub`, `candidate` are strings, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub`, `candidate` are strings, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`**
