According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more permutations of `chars` to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `perm` needs to be adjusted to the next permutation of `chars`. This can be achieved by moving to the next permutation in the sequence. The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `perm` should be the next permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars`.**
