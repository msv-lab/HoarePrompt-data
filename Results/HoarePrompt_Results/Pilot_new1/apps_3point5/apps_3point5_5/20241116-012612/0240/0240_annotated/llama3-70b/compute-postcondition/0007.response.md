Example Answer:
The value of `c` is added to `n`. The value of `c` is the next character in `s` if it is present in `t_set`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` still has characters left to iterate over, if the next character in `s` is present in `t_set`, then add it to `n`.
Output State: **`s` still has characters left to iterate over, if the next character in `s` is present in `t_set`, then add it to `n`**
