The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It updates the character counts of `s_counter` based on the characters in `sub_counter`. Then, it generates possible numbers from the remaining characters in `s_counter` and finds the smallest number among them. The function returns this smallest number.
