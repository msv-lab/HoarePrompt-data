According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. If `s` still has characters left to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string. The loop will execute one more time if there are more characters left in `s` to iterate over. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is a string**
