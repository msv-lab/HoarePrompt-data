Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned an empty string. This assignment does not affect the values of `s`, `t`, or `t_set`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is an empty string**
