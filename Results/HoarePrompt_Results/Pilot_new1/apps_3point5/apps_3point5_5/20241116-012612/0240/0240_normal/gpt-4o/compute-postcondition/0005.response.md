According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `chars`, `sub`, `candidate`, and the result of the `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` function. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` contains at least 1 character, `sub` is a string representing a substring of a number, and `candidate` is the result of joining the elements of `perm`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `chars` should still contain at least 1 character.
2. `sub` should represent a different substring of the number, possibly the next substring in sequence.
3. `candidate` should be updated based on the new permutation of `chars`.
4. The outcome of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` should be considered to determine if the loop should continue.

State: **`chars` contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, `candidate` is updated based on the new permutation, and the outcome of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` determines if the loop continues.**
