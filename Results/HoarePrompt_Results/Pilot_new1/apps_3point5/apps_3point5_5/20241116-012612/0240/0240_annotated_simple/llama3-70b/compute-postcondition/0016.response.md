The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, both of which are strings. The function then returns the integer value of the concatenated characters from string `s` that are present in the set `t_set`, along with the concatenated value of string `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, and return the integer value of concatenated characters from `s` present in `t_set` along with the concatenated value of `t`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters `s` and `t`, returns the integer value of concatenated characters from `s` present in `t_set` along with the concatenated value of `t`.**
