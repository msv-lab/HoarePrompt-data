Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is incremented by the ASCII value of character `c`, which is present in the set `t_set`. The previous value of `n` is unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string, the character `c` is present in the set `t_set`, `n` is incremented by the ASCII value of `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, the character `c` is present in the set `t_set`, `n` is incremented by the ASCII value of `c`**
