The variable `candidate` is assigned the value obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. The previous values of `perm` are unknown, so the output state is: `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`**
