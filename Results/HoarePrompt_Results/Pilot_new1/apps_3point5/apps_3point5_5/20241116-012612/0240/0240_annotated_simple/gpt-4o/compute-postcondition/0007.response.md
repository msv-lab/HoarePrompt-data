Example Answer:
The `yield` statement returns the `candidate` string, which is obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. The values of `candidate` and `perm` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so the output state is: `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`**
