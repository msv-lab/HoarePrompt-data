Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in the appropriate variables. It then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights and checks if the color counts in that interval match the desired counts. If a matching interval is found, it sets the `found` flag to True and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints "YES" if a matching interval is found, otherwise it prints "NO". The program logic follows the problem description and should work correctly for all potential cases.
