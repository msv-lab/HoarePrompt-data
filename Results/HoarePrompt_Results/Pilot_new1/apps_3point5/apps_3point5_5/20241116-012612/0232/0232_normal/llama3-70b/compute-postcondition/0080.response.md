Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` has been incremented by 1 if `color` was already a key in `window_counts`. The values in `window_counts` for all other keys remain unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, `counts`, `colors`) maintain their initial values as described in the precondition. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `found` remains unchanged.***
