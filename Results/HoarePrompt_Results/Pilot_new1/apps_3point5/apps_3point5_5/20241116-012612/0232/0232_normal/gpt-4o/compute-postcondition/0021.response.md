Output State: **If the loop executes, `current_counts` will be updated based on the conditions provided. `left` will be incremented until the conditions are no longer met. If `desired_counts` are equal to `current_counts` for all colors, the function will return 'YES'. `right` will be incremented, and `n` will be greater than 0. If the loop does not start due to initial conditions not meeting the loop's criteria, the variables will remain unchanged.**
