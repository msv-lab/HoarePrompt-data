According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` increments until the condition is no longer met, `current_counts` is updated accordingly, `right` is at its maximum value, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be incremented by 1, and `left` should remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **`current_counts` updated, `left` incremented, `right` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0**
