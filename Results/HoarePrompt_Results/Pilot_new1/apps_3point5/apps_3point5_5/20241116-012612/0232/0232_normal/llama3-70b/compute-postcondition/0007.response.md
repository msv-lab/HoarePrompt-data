Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 color, counts is a list of m integers such that $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$ obtained from splitting the input; color_counts is a dictionary with color as a key and its count as the value. If color is not in color_counts, then color_counts[color] is set to 0.***
