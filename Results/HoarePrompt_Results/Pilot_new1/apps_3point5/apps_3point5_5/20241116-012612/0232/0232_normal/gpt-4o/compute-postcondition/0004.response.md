Example Answer:
The value of `current_counts` at the index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1. The values of `left`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 0, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated integer values, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`left` is 0, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated integer values, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
