Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `n`, `colors`, `counts` remain unchanged. `window_counts` is a dictionary where each `color` key represents the count of that color in the `colors` list up to the current index `j`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is True and the loop breaks.***
