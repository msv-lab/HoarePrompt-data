Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` has a value of 1, `i` is equal to `j + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, all values in `window_counts` are sorted and match the corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is True, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. After the execution of the if statement, the program sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the condition of all counts matching the targets has been met. This ensures that the program has successfully identified the target counts in `window_counts` and `counts` and updated the `found` variable accordingly.***
