Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `m` and values are taken from the list `k`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values set to 0; `left` is 0; `right` is from 0 to `n-1`; and at least one color in `current_counts` has a count less than the corresponding count in `desired_counts`. If all counts in `current_counts` match the corresponding counts in `desired_counts` for every color, the function returns 'YES'.***
