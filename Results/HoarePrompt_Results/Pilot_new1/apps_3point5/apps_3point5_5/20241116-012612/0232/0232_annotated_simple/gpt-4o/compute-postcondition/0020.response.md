According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the count of the color at the `right` index in `current_counts` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the `right` index needs to be adjusted to the next index, which is `right + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **No specific changes in the state, only the count of the color at the `right + 1` index in `current_counts` is incremented by 1**
