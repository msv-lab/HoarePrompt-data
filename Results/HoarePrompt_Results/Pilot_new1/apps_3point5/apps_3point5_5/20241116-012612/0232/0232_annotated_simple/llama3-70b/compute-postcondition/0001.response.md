Example Answer:
The list `colors` is assigned the input values after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of variables `n`, `m`, and `counts` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is an integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. The sum of all elements in counts is less than or equal to n.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is an integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. The sum of all elements in counts is less than or equal to n**
