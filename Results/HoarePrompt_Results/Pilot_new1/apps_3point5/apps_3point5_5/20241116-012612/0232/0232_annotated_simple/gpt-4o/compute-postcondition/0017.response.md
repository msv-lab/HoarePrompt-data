Example Answer:
The count for the color at index `right` in `colors` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If all values in current_counts for the colors match the corresponding values in desired_counts except for one color, the function will continue to decrement the count for that color and move the left pointer until the conditions are met.
Output State: **If all values in current_counts for the colors match the corresponding values in desired_counts except for one color, the function will continue to decrement the count for that color and move the left pointer until the conditions are met.**
