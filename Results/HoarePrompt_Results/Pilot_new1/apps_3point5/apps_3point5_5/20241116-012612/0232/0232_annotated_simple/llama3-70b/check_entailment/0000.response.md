Correctness: True

The program correctly implements the problem description by iterating through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights and checking if the counts of lightsabers in that interval match the desired counts. If a valid interval is found, it sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints "YES" if `found` is True, indicating that an interval with the prescribed color counts exists, and "NO" otherwise.

The program handles all potential cases and edge cases, ensuring that it follows the problem description for every input scenario.
