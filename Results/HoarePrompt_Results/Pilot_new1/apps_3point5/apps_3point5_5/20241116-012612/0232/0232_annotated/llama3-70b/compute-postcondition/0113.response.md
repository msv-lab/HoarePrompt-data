Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable set to True, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `colors` is a list of colors, `window_counts` is updated with the count of the color `color`, where `color` is the color at index `n - 2` in the list `colors`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j - 1]`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all the values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. This ensures that the program maintains the initial values of the variables and correctly updates `found` based on the equality condition.***
