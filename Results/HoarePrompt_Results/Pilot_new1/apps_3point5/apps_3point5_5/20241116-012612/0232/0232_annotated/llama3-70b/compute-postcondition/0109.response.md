Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable set to True, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `window_counts` is updated with the count of the color `color` where `color` is the color at index `n - 2` in the list `colors`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j - 1]`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j] and `window_counts[color]` is set to 0 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`.***
