According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is equal to the value of `n`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **If there is at least one color with a desired count greater than the current count, `right` is incremented by 1, `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, and `n` remain the same**
