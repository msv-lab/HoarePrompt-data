Example Answer:
The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is equal to `i`. The values of `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `window_counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
