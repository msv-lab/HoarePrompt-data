Output State: **`found` is a boolean variable that is set to True if all the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after the execution of the if statement. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged at 2 and an integer greater than or equal to 2, respectively. The variable `j` is equal to `n`. The dictionary `window_counts` is updated with the count of the color `color`, where `color` is the color at index `n - 1` in the list `colors`. The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is reset to 0 and then incremented by 1. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if statement, ensuring the integrity of the program variables and their relationships. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False.**
