Example Answer:
The `counts` list is updated by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split and converted to integers, updating the `counts` list. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, with each color in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being at least 1 and at most n.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, with each color in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being at least 1 and at most n**
