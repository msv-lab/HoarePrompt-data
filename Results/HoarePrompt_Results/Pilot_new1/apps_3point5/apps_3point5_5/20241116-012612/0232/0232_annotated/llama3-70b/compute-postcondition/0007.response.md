Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a non-empty list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, with each color in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being at least 1 and at most n; `color_counts` is a dictionary. If the color was not in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0.***
