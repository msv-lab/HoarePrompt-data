Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is the next value after the last iteration. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. This covers all possible cases where the characters at index `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal in the string `s`.***
