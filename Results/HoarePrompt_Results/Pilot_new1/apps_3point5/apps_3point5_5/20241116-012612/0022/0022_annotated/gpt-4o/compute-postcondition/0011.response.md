According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is the next value after the last iteration. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2` after the adjustment. Since `i` is the next value after the last iteration, `i` should be increased by 1. 

State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is the next value after the last iteration + 1**
