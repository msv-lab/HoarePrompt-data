According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 3**
