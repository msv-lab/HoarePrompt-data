The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. If the length of the string `s` is at least 2, the function checks if the characters at the beginning and end of the string are the same. If any pair of characters is different, the function returns False. If the length of the string `s` is less than 2, the function will not execute the loop. In this case, the function returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return False if any pair of characters at the beginning and end of the string are different. If the length of the string is less than 2, the function returns True.
