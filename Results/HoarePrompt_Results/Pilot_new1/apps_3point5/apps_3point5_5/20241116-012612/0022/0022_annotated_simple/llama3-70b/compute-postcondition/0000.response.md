Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string. Since the input is constrained to English letters only, the length of the string can be between 1 and 1000 characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters**
