Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. This covers all cases where the characters at the specified indices do not match, resulting in the program returning False.***
