Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is 2 or greater, `is_spalindrome` is True. If the characters at symmetric positions within `s` are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute and `is_spalindrome` remains True.**
