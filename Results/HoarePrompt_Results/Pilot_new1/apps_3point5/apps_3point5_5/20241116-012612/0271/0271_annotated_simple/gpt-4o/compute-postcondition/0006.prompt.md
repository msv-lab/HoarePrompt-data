You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the conditions in the program fragment. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts, and if there is an elif part, it will be described in the else postcondition. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. If the program fragment contains nested if statements, you only need to focus on the outermost condition, as the postconditions for the nested if statements are included in the if postcondition and else postcondition.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.
Look if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling esecially those concerning the boundary values of the different cases. Make sure to include these potential cases in the postcondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
    return None
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    return n
else:
    return int(n)
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
    return False
else:
    return True
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    n = -n
    m += 1
else:
    if  n == 0:
        return m    
    else:
        n -= 13
        m += 1
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
    if x > 10:
        y = x * 2
    else:
        y = x + 5
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; remainder is an integer between 0 and 9
Program Fragment:
```
if remainder <= 5:
    result = n - remainder
else:
    result = n + (10 - remainder)

```
if part: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 5; `result` is the result of n - remainder
else part: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 6 and 9; `result` is the sum of `n` and (10 - `remainder`)

Your task is to complete the overall postcondition of the whole if else block. Summarise all the cases and give the overall state of the program after the if else executes covering all edge cases but summarisisng them together. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
