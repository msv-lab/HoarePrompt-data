Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 5. The value of `result` depends on the values of `n` and `remainder`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 5; `result` is the result of n - remainder**
