Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, and the value of `remainder` is an integer between 6 and 9. After executing the code, `result` will have a value based on the values of `n` and `remainder`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is an integer from 6 to 9, `result` is the sum of `n` and `(10 - remainder)`**
