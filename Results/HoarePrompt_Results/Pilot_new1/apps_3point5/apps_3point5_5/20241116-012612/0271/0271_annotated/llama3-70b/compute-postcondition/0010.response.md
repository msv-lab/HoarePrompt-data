The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input. The function is expected to return something based on the constraints provided. Since the parameter constraints specify that `n` is a non-negative integer, the function is likely to return a value based on this constraint. However, without any further information on the expected output, it is not possible to determine the exact functionality of the function.
