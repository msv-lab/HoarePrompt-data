Example Answer:
The code calculates n + (10 - n % 10), where n is a non-negative integer and the remainder of n divided by 10 is larger than 5. This expression essentially rounds up n to the next multiple of 10. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer and n is not divisible by 10 with the remainder of n divided by 10 being larger than 5.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer and n is not divisible by 10 with the remainder of n divided by 10 being larger than 5**
