Example Answer:
If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` will be `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` will be `n + (10 - remainder)`. The calculation of `result` depends on the value of `remainder` and `n`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9; `result` is the calculated result based on the conditions mentioned above.**
