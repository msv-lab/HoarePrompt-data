Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and n is not divisible by 10. If the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n without the last digit. If the remainder of n divided by 10 is greater than 5, the program prints the next multiple of 10 greater than n.***
