Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, the program prints n. If n is not divisible by 10, the program considers two cases: 
1. If the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n without the last digit.
2. If the remainder of n divided by 10 is greater than 5, the program prints the next multiple of 10 greater than n.***
