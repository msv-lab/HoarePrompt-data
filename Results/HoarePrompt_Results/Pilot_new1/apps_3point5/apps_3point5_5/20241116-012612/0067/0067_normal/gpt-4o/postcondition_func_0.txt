The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user input. It then calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on the input values. If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-'. If the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
