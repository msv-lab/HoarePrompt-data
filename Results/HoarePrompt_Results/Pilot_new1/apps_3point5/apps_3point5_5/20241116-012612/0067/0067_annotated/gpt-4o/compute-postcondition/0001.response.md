Example Answer:
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100. The values of `y` and `z` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, and `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`**
