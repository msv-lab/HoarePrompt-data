The function does not accept any parameters. It reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the user input. It then calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on these values. If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-'. If the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. The function handles cases where the sum of x and z is less than y by printing '-'.
