Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with length `n` where `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `digits` is non-empty, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 1, and the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied. After the execution of the if statement, the program updates `used_cubes[i]` to `True`, sets `found` to True, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables remain unchanged.***
