According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If the list contains at least 2 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must contain at least 2 cubes.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube**
