Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of individual digits of the number `num` after converting it to a string. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, but assuming `num` is a positive integer, the output state would be: `n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) where i ranges from 1 to n and j ranges from 1 to 6; digits is a list containing the individual digits of num as strings.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9); digits is a list containing the individual digits of num as strings**
