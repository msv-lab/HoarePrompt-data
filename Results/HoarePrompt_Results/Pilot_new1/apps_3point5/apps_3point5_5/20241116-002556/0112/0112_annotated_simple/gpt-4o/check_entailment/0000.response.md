Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program consists of two functions, func_1 and can_form_number, which work together to determine the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes.
2. The func_1 function iterates through numbers starting from 1 until it finds a number that cannot be formed using the available cubes, and then returns the maximum number that can be formed.
3. The can_form_number function checks if a given number can be formed using the available cubes based on the digits in the number and the faces of the cubes.
4. The logic in both functions ensures that Masha can build all numbers from 1 to x using her cubes, as described in the problem statement.
5. The code handles all potential cases where Masha can form numbers using the cubes, and there are no edge cases identified where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
6. Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.
