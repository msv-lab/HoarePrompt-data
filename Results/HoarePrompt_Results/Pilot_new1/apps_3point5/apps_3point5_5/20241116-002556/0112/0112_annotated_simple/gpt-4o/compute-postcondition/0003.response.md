Example Answer: 
The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. There are no other variables affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; used_cubes is a list of `False` values with a length of n, digits is a non-empty list, digit is the first element in digits, found is False.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; used_cubes is a list of `False` values with a length of n, digits is a non-empty list, digit is the first element in digits, found is False**
