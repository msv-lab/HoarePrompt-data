Example Answer:
The code removes '0' from the set digits. Since '0' is guaranteed to be in digits, it will be removed. The set digits will be updated without '0'. Therefore, the Output State is: If cubes is a list with at least one cube, the loop executed and digits is a set containing all the digits from all cubes without '0'. If cubes is an empty list, the loop did not execute and digits remains an empty set without '0'.
Output State: **If cubes is a list with at least one cube, the loop executed and digits is a set containing all the digits from all cubes without '0'. If cubes is an empty list, the loop did not execute and digits remains an empty set without '0'.**
