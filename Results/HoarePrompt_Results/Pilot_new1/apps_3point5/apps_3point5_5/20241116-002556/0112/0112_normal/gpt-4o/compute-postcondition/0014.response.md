Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used and `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. This ensures that the correct cube is marked as used, the search is successful, and the loop is exited as intended. All other variables maintain their initial values and relationships.***
