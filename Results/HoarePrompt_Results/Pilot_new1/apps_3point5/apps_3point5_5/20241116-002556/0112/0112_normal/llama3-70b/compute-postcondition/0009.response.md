According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 4 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, cube is the third cube in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 cubes, and the cube should be the fourth cube in the list. Additionally, the digits set should contain the digits of the fourth cube along with any additional digits from the update operation.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 4 cubes, `cube` is the fourth cube in the list, and `digits` is a set containing the digits of the fourth cube along with any additional digits from the update operation**
