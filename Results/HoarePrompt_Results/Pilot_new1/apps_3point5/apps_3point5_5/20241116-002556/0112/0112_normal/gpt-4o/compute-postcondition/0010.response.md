According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `digits` list. If `i` is less than the length of the `digits` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True if the `digit` is found in any cube face, otherwise False, and `i` is in the range of 0 to n-1. To execute the loop one more time, the `digits` list must have more than 1 character and `i` should be less than the length of the `digits` list.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is less than the length of the `digits` list**
