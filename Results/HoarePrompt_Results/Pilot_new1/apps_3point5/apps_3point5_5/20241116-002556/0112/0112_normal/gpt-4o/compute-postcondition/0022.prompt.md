You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is lower than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Output State: 

The loop iterates through the range of `n` and checks if the `i-th` cube face has not been used and if the `digit` is present in that cube face. If the condition is met, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. 

If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False. `used_cubes` retains its initial state with all elements as False. `digit` remains the first character in the `digits` list.

If `digits` has only one character, the loop executes once, updating `used_cubes` based on the condition. `found` is set to True if the condition is satisfied. `digit` remains the first character in the `digits` list.

If `digits` has more than one character, the loop executes multiple times, updating `used_cubes` accordingly. The final state of `used_cubes` reflects the cube faces that have been used. `found` is True if the condition is satisfied at any point. `digit` progresses through the characters in `digits`.

Overall, the loop aims to find if any cube face contains the current `digit` and marks that cube face as used. If successful, `found` is set to True. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False.

**`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element is True if the corresponding cube face contains the current `digit`. `found` is True if the `digit` is found in any cube face, otherwise False. `digit` progresses through the characters in `digits`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False.**
if condition:
```
if (not found):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
