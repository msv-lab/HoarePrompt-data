According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, so the initial states need to be adjusted accordingly. 

For the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is in the range of 0 to n-1**
