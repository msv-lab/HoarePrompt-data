According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the state needs to be adjusted so that cubes list has at least 1 cube. Additionally, since digits is an empty set initially, it does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, the adjusted state should be `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set**
