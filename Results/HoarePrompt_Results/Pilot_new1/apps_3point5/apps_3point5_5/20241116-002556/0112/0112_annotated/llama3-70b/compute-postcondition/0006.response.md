Example Answer:
The code updates the set `digits` by adding the string representation of each digit in every cube present in the list `cubes`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact cubes or digits, we can generalize the output state as: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 cubes, and `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cubes.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 cubes, and `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cubes**
