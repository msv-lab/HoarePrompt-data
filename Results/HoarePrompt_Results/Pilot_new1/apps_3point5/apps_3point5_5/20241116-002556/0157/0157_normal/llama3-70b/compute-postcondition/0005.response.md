The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the preconditions that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000. The function does not return any value, it performs some operations or calculations based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified constraints.
