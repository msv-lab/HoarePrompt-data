Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `b` will be the input provided by the user. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is the input integer provided by the user, `c` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000**
