Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. `b` is not equal to `a`. `c` is not equal to 0. If (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, then 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. This covers all possible scenarios of the program fragment execution.***
