Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. If (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the program fragment execution, ensuring the validity of the output based on the initial conditions.***
