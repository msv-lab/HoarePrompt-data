Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are dependent on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input**
