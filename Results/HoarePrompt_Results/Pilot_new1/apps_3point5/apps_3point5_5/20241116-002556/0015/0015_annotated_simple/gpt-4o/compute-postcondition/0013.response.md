Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, the program prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.***
