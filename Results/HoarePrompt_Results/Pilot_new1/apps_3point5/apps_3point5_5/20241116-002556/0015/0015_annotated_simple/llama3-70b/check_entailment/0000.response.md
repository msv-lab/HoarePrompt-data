Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly determines whether Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence based on the given conditions. 
1. If the difference between neighboring elements is 0 (c=0), then the program checks if the first element a is equal to b. If they are equal, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
2. If the difference between neighboring elements is not 0, the program checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
3. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
