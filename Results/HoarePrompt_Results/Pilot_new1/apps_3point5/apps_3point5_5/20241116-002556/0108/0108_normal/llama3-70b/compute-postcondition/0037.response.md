Output State: **If the string `s` contains at least one occurrence of any character in the `alphabet`, the loop will iterate through each character in `alphabet`. For each character found in `s`, it will be replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, and the replaced character will be added to the `res` string. If `s` does not contain any characters from `alphabet`, the loop will not execute, and `s` and `res` will remain unchanged.**
