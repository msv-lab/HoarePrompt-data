Output State: **If `char` is in `s`, then after the loop executes, `s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character one position ahead in the ASCII table, `res` contains the concatenation of all the characters replaced, and `char` is the character one position behind the updated `char` in the ASCII table. If `char` is not in `s`, the loop does not execute, and `s` and `res` remain unchanged.**
