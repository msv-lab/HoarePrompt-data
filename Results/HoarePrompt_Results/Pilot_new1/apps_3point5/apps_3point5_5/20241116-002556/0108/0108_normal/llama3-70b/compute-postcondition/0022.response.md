Example Answer:
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that is one greater in ASCII value. The `res` variable is concatenated with `char`, but the value of `res` and `char` are not given in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: variable `res` is concatenated with variable `char`, and `s` is updated after the replacement operation.
Output State: **variable `res` is concatenated with variable `char`, `s` is updated after replacement operation**
