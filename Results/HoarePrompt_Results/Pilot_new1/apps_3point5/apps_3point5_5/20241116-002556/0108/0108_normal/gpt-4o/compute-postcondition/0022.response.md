Postcondition: ***If `target_len` is greater than 0, after the loop execution, `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is the length of `s`, and `j` is either equal to `target_len` or less depending on the number of matches between `s` and `target`. If `target_len` is 0 or `s` is an empty string, then `i` is the length of `s`, and `j` is 0. If `target_len` is greater than the length of `s`, the loop will not start. If `j` is equal to `target_len`, then `target` is printed. Otherwise, if `j` is less than `target_len`, -1 is printed.***
