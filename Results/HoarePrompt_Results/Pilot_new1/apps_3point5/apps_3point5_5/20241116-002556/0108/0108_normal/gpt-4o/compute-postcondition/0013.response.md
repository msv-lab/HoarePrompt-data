Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` can be either 0 or 1. After execution, the value of `j` will be either 1 or 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `j` is either 1 or 2.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `j` is either 1 or 2**
