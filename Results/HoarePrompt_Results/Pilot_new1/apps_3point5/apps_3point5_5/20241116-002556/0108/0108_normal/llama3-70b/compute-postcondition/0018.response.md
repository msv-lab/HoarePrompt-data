Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`, so the new value of `res` will have `char` appended at the end. The variable `s` is modified to have the next character in `alphabet` after replacing the first occurrence of `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is modified with the next character in `alphabet` after replacing the first occurrence of `char`, `res` has additional characters added from `char`, and `char` is added to the end of `res`.
Output State: **`s` is modified with the next character in `alphabet` after replacing the first occurrence of `char`, `res` has additional characters added from `char`, and `char` is added to the end of `res`**
