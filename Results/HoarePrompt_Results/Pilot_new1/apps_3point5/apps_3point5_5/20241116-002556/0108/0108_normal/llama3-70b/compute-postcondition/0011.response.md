Example Answer:
The `char` in string `s` is replaced by the next character in the alphabet using `s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)`. After execution, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` is a string with an additional character, and `char` is added to the end of `res`.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` is a string with an additional character, and `char` is added to the end of `res`**
