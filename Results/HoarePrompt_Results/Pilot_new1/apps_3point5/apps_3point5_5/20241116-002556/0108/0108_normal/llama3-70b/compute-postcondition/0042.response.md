Postcondition: ***`s` is a string that may or may not contain characters from the `alphabet`. If `s` contains at least one occurrence of any character in the `alphabet`, `res` is a string with a length of 26, where each character is the next character in `alphabet` for each character found in `s`. If `s` does not contain any characters from the `alphabet`, both `s` and `res` remain unchanged. In both cases, the program will either print `res` if its length is 26 or print -1 if the length is not 26.***
