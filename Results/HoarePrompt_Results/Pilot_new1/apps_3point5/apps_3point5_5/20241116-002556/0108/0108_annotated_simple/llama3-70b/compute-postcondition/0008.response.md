Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced with the character one position ahead in the ASCII table. The replacement is done only once. The replaced character is back in `s`, and the added character is stored in `res`. The state of `alphabet` remains the same. 
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced once and the replaced character is back in `s`, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
