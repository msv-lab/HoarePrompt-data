Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a string as input and iterates through the alphabet, replacing characters in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. If the resulting string contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, it prints the string, otherwise it prints -1. The logic of the program is correct and it handles all cases as described in the problem statement. The program will output the correct result for any input string that can form the English alphabet as a subsequence.
