According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, `target`, `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is increased based on the condition `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than the length of `s` and `j` should be less than the length of `target`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is increased based on the condition `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`.**
