According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `alphabet`. If `alphabet` is a valid iterable, the loop can execute. Since `s` is mentioned but not used in the loop, we can ignore it. Before the loop starts, `res` is an empty string, so to ensure the loop executes, `alphabet` must be a valid iterable. 
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
