Postcondition: ***If the first character of `s` is in `alphabet`, after the loop finishes, `s` will be a string with characters replaced according to the conditions, `res` will contain the characters added in the iterations, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable. If the first character of `s` is not in `alphabet`, the loop will not execute and `s`, `res`, and `alphabet` will remain unchanged. The length of `res` is not equal to 26.***
