Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to the end of `res`. Since `char` is in `s`, and `res` already had the first character added previously, the output state is: `s` has the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, `res` has the first character added twice, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable, and `char` is in `s`.
Output State: **`s` has the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, `res` has the first character added twice, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable, and `char` is in `s`**
