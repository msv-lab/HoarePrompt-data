Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input string `s` and iterates through the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character is present in `s`, then adds the character to the result `res` and replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If the length of `res` is 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on the input string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.**
