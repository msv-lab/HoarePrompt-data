Example Answer: 
`res` is appended with the value of `char` for each iteration of the loop until `char` is no longer in `s`. The state of `alphabet` remains unchanged as it is a valid iterable. 
Output State: **If `char` is in `s`, `res` has the first character added for each iteration of the loop until `char` is no longer in `s`, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable.**
