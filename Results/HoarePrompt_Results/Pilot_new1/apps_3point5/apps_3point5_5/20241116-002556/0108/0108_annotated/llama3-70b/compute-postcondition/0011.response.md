Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced by the character after it using the `replace` function with a limit of 1 occurrence. The value of `char` is the last character in the alphabet, so it will be replaced by the character after it. The variable `alphabet` and `res` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the last character in the alphabet incremented by 1, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the last character in the alphabet added to the end.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the last character in the alphabet incremented by 1, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the last character in the alphabet added to the end**
