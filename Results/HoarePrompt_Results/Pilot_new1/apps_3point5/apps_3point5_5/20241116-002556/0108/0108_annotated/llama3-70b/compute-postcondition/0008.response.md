Example Answer:
The code replaces the next occurrence of the character `char` in string `s` with the character after it in the alphabet. The character after `char` is found by incrementing its ASCII value by 1 using `ord` and `chr` functions. The variable `res` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the next occurrence of `char` replaced by the character after it in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the character `char` added to the end.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the next occurrence of `char` replaced by the character after it in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the character `char` added to the end**
