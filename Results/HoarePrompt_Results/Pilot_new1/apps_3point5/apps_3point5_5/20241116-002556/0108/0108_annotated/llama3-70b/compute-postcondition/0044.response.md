Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a string `s` from the user and processes it based on the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces all occurrences of that character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. The function then constructs a string `res` containing all the processed characters in the order they were replaced. If `res` has a length of 26, the function prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function operates on a string `s` of lowercase English letters and handles cases where `s` does not contain any character from the alphabet.**
