Example Answer:
`char` is added to the end of `res`, so the last character of `alphabet` is added to the end of `res`. The value of `s` and `alphabet` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the last character in the alphabet replaced by the character after it, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the last character in the alphabet added to the end.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the last character in the alphabet replaced by the character after it, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the last character in the alphabet added to the end**
