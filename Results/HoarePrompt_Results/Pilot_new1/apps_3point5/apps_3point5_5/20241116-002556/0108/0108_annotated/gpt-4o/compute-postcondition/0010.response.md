Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. The relationship between `s`, `target`, `target_len`, `i`, and `j` remains consistent after the execution of the if statement.***
