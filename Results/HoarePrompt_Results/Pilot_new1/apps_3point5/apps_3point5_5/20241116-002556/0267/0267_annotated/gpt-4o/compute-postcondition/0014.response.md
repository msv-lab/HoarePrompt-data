The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The function returns the final value of `total_sum` after the loop executes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers l, r, and k. It calculates the total_sum after the loop executes and returns the final value.**
