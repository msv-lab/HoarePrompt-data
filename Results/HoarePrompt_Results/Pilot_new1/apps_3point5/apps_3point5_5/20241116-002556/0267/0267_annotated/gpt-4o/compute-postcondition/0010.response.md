Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if block, `total_sum` is updated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the next number after `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true. This holds true for all possible scenarios and edge cases where `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true.***
