The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. It calculates the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. The function utilizes a dictionary `dp` for memoization. The code does not provide the implementation of the `count` function, so it is assumed to be defined elsewhere.
