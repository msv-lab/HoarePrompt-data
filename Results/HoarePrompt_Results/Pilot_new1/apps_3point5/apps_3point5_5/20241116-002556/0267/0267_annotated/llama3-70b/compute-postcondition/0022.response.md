The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary used to store computed values. 

Case 1: If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0. There are no changes to `n`, `k`, or `dp` in this case.

Case 2: If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value associated with that key. Otherwise, there are no changes to `n`, `k`, or `dp`.

Case 3: The function returns the value associated with key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept non-negative integer `n`, positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` to store computed values. It returns 0 if `k` equals 0, the value associated with key (n, k) if it exists in `dp`, and otherwise the function returns the value associated with key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`.
