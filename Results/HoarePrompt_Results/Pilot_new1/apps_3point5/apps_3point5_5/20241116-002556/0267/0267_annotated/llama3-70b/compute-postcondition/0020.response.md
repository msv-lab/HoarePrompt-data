Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary dp, the function returns the value associated with that key. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is set to n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is calculated based on a series of mathematical operations involving n, k, and the modulo operation with the value of MOD. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases related to the computation and storage of values in the dictionary dp.***
