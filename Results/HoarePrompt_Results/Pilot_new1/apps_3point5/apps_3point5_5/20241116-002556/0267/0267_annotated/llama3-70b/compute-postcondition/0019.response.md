Example Answer:
If k is 1 or less, dp[n, k] remains 9. If k is greater than 1, the loop will iterate k-1 times, updating dp[n, k] each time based on the formula provided. The code snippet takes the modulo of dp[n, k] with MOD. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[n, k] is updated based on the modulo operation.
Output State: **dp[n, k] is updated based on the modulo operation**
