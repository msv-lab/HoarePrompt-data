According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`, as well as the result of `func_1(num, k)`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r` and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is the updated value after the execution of the if block, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true. The value of `total_sum` is updated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `num` needs to be updated to the next number after `l`, and `total_sum` needs to be updated accordingly.

State: **`total_sum` is the updated value after the execution of the if block, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the next number after `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true. The value of `total_sum` is updated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`**
