According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the key (n, k) with a new calculated value, and `i` is equal to `k`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `k`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the key (n, k) with a new calculated value, and `i` is less than `k`**
