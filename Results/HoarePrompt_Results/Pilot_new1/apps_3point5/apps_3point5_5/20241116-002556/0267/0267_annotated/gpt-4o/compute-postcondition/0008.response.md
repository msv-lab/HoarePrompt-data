According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r` inclusive. The conditions for the update of `total_sum` are that `total_sum` is updated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the next number after `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `total_sum` has been updated, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the next number after `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **After the execution of the if block, `total_sum` is updated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the next number after `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true.**
