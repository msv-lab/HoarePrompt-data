According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to `k-1`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, the key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp` has a value of 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted such that `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the key (n, k) with a value of 9, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the key (n, k) with a value of 9, `i` is 1**
