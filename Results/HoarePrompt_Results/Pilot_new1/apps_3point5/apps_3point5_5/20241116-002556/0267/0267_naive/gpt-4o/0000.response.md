Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function `func_1` checks if a number has at most $k$ different digits, and the function `func_2` iterates through the range $l$ to $r$ and adds the numbers that meet the condition. The modulo operation is correctly applied to the total sum. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
