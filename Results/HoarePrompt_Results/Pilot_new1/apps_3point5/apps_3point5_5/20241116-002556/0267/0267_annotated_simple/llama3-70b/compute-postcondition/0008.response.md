Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary to store intermediate results. If k is equal to 0, the program returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary dp, then the program returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, (n >= 10 ** k)***
