Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` remains the same as the initial value of `l`. The output state is: `total_sum` is updated according to the calculation, `l` is less than `r`, and `num` retains its initial value of `l`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the calculation, `l` is less than `r`, `num` retains its initial value of `l`**
