Correctness: True

Explanation: 
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count`.
- The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It does this by subtracting the result of `count(l-1, k, dp)` from the result of `count(r, k, dp)` and then taking the modulo `MOD`.
- The `count` function calculates the count of numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits. It uses dynamic programming to store intermediate results in the dictionary `dp`.
- The program handles the cases where `k` is 0, `n` is less than `10**k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `10**k` appropriately by updating the values in the dictionary `dp`.
- The calculations in the `count` function are based on the constraints provided in the problem description, ensuring that the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits is correctly calculated.
- The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the given input.
