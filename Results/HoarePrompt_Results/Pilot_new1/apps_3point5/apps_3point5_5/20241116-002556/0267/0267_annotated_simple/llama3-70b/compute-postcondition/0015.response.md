Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The value of `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than or equal to `k`. 
Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value, `i` is increased by 1, `i` is less than or equal to `k`**
