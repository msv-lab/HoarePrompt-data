Example Answer:
`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num` is `l + 1`. `l` is incremented to `l + 1`, so `num` becomes `l + 1`. Therefore, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`, `l` is incremented to `l + 1`, and `num` is set to `l + 1`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`, `l` is incremented to `l + 1`, `num` is set to `l + 1`**
