Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the given expression. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `dp[n, k]` are known. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `dp[n, k]` will be updated based on the expression provided.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value, `i` is increased by 1**
