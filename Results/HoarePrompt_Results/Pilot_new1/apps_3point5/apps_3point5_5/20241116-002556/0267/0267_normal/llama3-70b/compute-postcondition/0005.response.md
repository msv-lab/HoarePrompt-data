Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. If `(n, k)` is already a key in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `dp`.***
