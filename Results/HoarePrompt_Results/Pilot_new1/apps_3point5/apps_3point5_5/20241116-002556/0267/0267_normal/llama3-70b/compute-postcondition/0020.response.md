Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. If `(n, k)` is already a key in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key. If `n` is less than 10 to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. Otherwise, if `k` is 1 or less, no additional calculations are performed. If `k` is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the provided formula. The final value of `dp[n, k]` is calculated considering all edge cases and the modulo operation with `MOD`.***
