According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value, `i` is incremented by 1**
