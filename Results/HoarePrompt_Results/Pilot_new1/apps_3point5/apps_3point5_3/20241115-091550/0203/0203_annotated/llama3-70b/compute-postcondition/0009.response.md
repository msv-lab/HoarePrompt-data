Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers. If the first character in the `fractions` string is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` remains at 0. Otherwise, if the first character is not 'D', `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `depublicans` remains at 0.***
