According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `fractions`. If the string contains at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the fractions string must not be empty. So, for the loop to execute, the fractions string must not be empty and the fraction variable should be the first character in the string. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character in the `fractions` string**
