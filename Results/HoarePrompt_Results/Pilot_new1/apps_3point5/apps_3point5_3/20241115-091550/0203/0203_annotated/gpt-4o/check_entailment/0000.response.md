Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the described voting procedure where employees from different factions take turns in denying others the right to vote until only one employee is left to determine the outcome. The code maintains two queues, one for each faction, and updates them based on the order of voting and denials. The final result is determined by checking which queue is not empty. The annotations provide a clear summary of the code logic and the state of the program at different stages, helping to understand how the code processes the input data. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making the correctness evaluation **True**.
