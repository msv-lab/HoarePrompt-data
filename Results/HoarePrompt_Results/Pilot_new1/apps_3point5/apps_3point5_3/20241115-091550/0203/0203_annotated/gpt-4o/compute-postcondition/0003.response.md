Example Answer: 
A new empty list `r_queue` is created. The previous values of `votes` and `d_queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list**
