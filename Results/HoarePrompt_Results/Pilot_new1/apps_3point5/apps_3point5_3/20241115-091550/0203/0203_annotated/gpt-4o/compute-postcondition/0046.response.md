The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to process the input data based on the following constraints: 
- **Precondition**: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.

The function `func` is expected to perform certain operations on the input data, but the specific details of these operations are not provided. The function will then return a certain output based on the processed input data.
