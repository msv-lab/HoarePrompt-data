Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately follows the problem description. It reads the number of employees and their fractions, then counts the occurrences of 'D' and non-'D' fractions. Based on the counts, it correctly prints 'D' if the count of 'D' fractions is greater than the count of non-'D' fractions, and 'R' otherwise. The code handles the voting process as described in the problem statement, where employees can deny others from voting until only one employee remains eligible to vote. The output matches the expected outcome based on the provided examples and the problem description.
