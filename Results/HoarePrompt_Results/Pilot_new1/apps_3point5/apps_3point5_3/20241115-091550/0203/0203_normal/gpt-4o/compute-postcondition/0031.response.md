Example Answer: 
`r_queue` appends a value that is `r_index + n`, where `r_index` is assigned a value popped from `r_queue`, and `n` is an input integer. The `r_queue` is not empty, so the new value is added to the end of the queue. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, `d_queue` is one element shorter, `r_queue` is not empty.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, `d_queue` is one element shorter, `r_queue` is not empty**
