Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. If `d_queue` is empty, an error will occur. The initial state includes `n` as an input integer, `votes` as a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, and the possibility of `d_queue` being empty. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, and `d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`**
