The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string of fractions. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and non-'D' fractions in the input. If the count of 'D' fractions is greater than the count of non-'D' fractions, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not return any value explicitly.
