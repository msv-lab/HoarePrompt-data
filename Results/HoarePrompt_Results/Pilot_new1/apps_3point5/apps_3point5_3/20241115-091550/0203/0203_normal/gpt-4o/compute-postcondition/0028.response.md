Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`, which means the first element of `d_queue` is removed and assigned to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` is not empty, the value assigned to `d_index` is the first element of `d_queue`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, `d_queue` is one element shorter, `r_queue` is not empty**
