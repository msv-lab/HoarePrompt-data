Example Answer:
`d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `d_index` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, `d_queue` is one element longer, `r_queue` is not empty.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, `d_queue` is one element longer, `r_queue` is not empty**
