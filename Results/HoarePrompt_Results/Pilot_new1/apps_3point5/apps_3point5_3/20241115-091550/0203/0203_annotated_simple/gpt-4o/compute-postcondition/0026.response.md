Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R'. If d_index < r_index, d_queue may be updated with remaining indices of 'D' characters, where the value (d_index + n) is appended. If d_index is not less than r_index, r_queue contains the appended value. r_queue remains unchanged. d_index contains the index of the popped 'D' character, and r_index contains the index of the popped 'R' character.***
