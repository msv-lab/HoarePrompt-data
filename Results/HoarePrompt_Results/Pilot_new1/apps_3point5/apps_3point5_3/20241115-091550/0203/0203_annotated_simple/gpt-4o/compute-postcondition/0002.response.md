Example Answer:
The list `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R'; d_queue is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R'; d_queue is an empty list**
