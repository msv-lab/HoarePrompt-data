Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers representing the count of 'D' and non-'D' fractions respectively. If the fraction is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1. If the fraction is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The state of the program variables after the execution of the if else block covers all cases where the fraction can be 'D' or non-'D', ensuring the correct increment of the respective counters.***
