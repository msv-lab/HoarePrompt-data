Example Answer:
The value of `r_index` is added to `n` and then appended to `r_queue`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and `r_index` contains the index of the popped 'R' character. Therefore, the new value added to `r_queue` will be `r_index + n`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_queue may be updated with remaining indices of 'D' characters, r_queue contains the appended value, d_index contains the index of the popped 'D' character, r_index contains the index of the popped 'R' character. The index of the popped 'D' character is not less than the index of the popped 'R' character.**
