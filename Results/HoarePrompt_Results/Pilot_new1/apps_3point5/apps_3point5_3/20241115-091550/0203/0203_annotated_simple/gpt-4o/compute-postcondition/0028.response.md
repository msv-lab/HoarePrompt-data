Example Answer:
The value at the front of the queue `d_queue` is removed and assigned to `d_index`. The previous values of the variables are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_index is updated as per the value popped from `d_queue`, r_index, d_queue, r_queue are updated.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_index is updated as per the value popped from `d_queue`, r_index, d_queue, r_queue are updated**
