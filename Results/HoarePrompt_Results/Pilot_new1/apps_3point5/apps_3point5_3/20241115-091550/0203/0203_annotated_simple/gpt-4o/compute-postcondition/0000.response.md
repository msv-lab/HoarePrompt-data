Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `votes` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R'**.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R'**
