Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem. It maintains two queues, one for 'D' employees and one for 'R' employees. It then iterates through the queues, popping the indices of the employees and updating the queues based on the comparison of the indices. The program correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on which queue is non-empty at the end. The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
