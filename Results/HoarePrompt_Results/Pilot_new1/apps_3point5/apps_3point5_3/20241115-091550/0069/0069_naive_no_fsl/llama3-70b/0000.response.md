Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
2. For each test case, it calculates the balance of the given string $s$ and compares it with the desired balance $x$.
3. If the balance matches $x$, it prints the length of the string $s$ plus 1, which represents the number of prefixes.
4. If the difference between $x$ and the balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in $s$, it prints -1 (indicating an infinite number of prefixes).
5. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes required to achieve the desired balance and prints it.
6. The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each test case.
