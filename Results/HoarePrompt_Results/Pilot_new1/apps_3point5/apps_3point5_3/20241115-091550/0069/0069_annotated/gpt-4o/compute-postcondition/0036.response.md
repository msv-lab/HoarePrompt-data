Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `count` is increased by 1**
