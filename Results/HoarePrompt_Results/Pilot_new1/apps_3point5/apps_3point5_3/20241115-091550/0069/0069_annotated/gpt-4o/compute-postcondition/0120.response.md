According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `results` is a list with at least 1 element, and `T` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `results` is a list with at least 2 elements, `T` is greater than 0**
