Postcondition: ***T remains greater than 0, n is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, x is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1], index is increased by 3, and balance is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string s. If n is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and the prefix_balances list remains a list of zeros.***
