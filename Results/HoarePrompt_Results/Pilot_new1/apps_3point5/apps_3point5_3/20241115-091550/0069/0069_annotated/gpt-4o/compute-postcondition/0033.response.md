Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it is an integer. The list `prefix_balances` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element.
Output State: **`count` is an integer incremented by 1, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element**
