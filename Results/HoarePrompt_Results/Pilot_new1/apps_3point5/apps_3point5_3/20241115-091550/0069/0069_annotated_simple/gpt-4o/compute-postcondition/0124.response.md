According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 4 results, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` is a list of results with at least 3 results, and the third result in the list is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list must have at least 4 results and the fourth result will be printed.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` is a list of results with at least 4 results, and the fourth result in the list is printed**
