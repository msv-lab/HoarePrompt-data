Postcondition: ***If n is greater than or equal to 1 and prefix_balances array is still non-empty, the values of x, b, and balance are such that ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), and count is incremented by 1. The program successfully increments the count by 1 if the specified conditions are met, ensuring that the values of x, b, and balance satisfy the given constraints.***
