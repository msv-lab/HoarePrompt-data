Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute and calculate the prefix balances based on the values in the string s. The loop updates the prefix_balances array with each iteration. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute. Additionally, the balance is equal to 0. The value of x is not in the prefix_balances array. `results` array appends 0.**
