Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The previous value of `n` was T + 1, and the previous value of `x` was an input integer. Therefore, the new values of `n` and `x` are based on the input. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **T is the previous value + 1, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, s is a string, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in the string s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1**
