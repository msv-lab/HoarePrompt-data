Postcondition: ***T is the previous value + 2, n and x are input integers, `s` is the input value, cnt0 is the count of '0's in `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1's in `s`, balance is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)***
