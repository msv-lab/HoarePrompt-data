Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 3, results is an empty list, x is assigned the integer value of data[1], balance is the result of the subtraction, prefix_balances is a list with at least 2 elements, b is the second element in prefix_balances, n is greater than 0, i is equal to n, count is an integer. If (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, count is incremented by 1.***
