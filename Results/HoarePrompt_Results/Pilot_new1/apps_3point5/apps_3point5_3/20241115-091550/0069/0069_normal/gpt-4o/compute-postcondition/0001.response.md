Example Answer:
The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings. Since no variables have been defined before this statement, the output state will be: T is a positive integer. For each test case, n is a positive integer, x is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, and s is a binary string of length n.
Output State: **T is a positive integer. For each test case, n is a positive integer, x is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, and s is a binary string of length n**
