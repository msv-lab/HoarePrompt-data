Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `index` is 3, `results` contains either -1 or 0 based on whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `balance` is 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with updated values based on the formula, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to n. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`; otherwise, 0 is appended.***
