Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned the corresponding input integer values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned the corresponding input integer values**
