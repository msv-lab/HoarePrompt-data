Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where `a` and `m` are known values. The value of `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned the corresponding input integer values, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned the corresponding input integer values, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula**
