Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `a`, `b` are assigned the corresponding input integer values, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula, `b_floor` is calculated as ((b - 1) % m) + 1, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is assigned the calculated value, and `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
