Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `a`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. The value of `a_block` depends on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b; `a` and `b` are assigned the input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values; `a_block` is calculated based on the input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b; `a` and `b` are assigned the input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values; `a_block` is calculated based on the input values**
