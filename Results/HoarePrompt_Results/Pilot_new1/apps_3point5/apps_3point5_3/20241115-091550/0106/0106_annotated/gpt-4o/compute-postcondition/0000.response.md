Example Answer:
The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The variables `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are involved in the calculation. The initial state does not provide the value of `apartment`, so the output state will depend on the value of `apartment` when the code is executed. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition**: **n, m, k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n, m, k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
