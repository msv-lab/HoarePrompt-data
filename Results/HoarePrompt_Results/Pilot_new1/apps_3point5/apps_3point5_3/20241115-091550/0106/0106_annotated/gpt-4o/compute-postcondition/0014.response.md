Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts positive integers n, m, k, a, b satisfying the given constraints. It calculates the total time required based on the locations of points a and b, considering walking times, floor differences, and exit times. If floor_a is equal to 1, the time to exit is set to 0; otherwise, it is calculated as 10 plus the difference between floor_a and 1. The function then determines the direct and reverse walking times between block_a and block_b, selecting the minimum of the two. It computes the time to reach the target floor, and finally, it returns the total time as the sum of exit time, minimum walk time, and time to target floor.**
