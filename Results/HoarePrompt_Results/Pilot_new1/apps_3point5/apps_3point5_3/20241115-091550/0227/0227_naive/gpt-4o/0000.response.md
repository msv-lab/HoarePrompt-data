Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the input sequence, checking if the difference between the current element and any previously assigned element is present in the assigned set. If not, it increments the count of variables required. The program then returns the minimum number of variables needed to perform the operations. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
