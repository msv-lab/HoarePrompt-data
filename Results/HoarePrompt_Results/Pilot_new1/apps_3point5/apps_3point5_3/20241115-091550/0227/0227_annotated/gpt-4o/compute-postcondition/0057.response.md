According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the list `assigned` and the conditions specified. If the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, then the loop will execute one more time with the specified changes. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` has more than 1 element. So for the loop to execute one more time, the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` must be present in `assigned`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`assigned` has more than 1 element and the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`**
