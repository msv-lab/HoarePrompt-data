According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the conditions that need to be adjusted are: `m` needs to be adjusted to 1, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1, and `n` needs to be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9), `assigned` is a set containing the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
