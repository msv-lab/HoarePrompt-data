According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `assigned`. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` has more than 1 element. If the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`assigned` has more than 1 element**
