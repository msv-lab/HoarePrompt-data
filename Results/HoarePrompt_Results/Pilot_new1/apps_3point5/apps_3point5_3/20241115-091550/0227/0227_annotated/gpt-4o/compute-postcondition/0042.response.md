Postcondition: ***`assigned` is an empty list or none of the elements in `a` minus any element in `assigned` are also in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` has at least one element and there exists an element in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is equal to it, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. In all cases, `i` is incremented to the next index and `m` is increased by 1***
