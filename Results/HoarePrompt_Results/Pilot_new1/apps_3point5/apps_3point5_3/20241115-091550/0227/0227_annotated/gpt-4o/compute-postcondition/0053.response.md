According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `assigned` list. If there are more elements left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` has at least 1 element, `can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, `i` is incremented to the next index after the last iteration, `m` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `assigned` list must have more than 1 element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`assigned` has more than 1 element, `can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, `i` is incremented to the next index after the last iteration, `m` is increased by 1**
