Postcondition: ***`assigned` is not empty, `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list, `x` is an integer. If the element at index `i` of list `a` minus `x` exists in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken. This ensures that the program maintains the initial conditions and successfully checks for the presence of a specific element in the `assigned` list, allowing for the continuation of the program execution.***
