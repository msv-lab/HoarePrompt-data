According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `assigned` set. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order within the range [1, 10^9], `assigned` contains the next element of list `a` and the next element in list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is True and the loop or if statement breaks. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `assigned` set should contain more elements.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order within the range [1, 10^9], `assigned` contains more elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
