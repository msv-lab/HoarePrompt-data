Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The elements of list `a` are already distinct positive integers within the specified range. Sorting the list does not change the values of the elements. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order where each element is within the range [1, 10^9]**.
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order where each element is within the range [1, 10^9]**.
