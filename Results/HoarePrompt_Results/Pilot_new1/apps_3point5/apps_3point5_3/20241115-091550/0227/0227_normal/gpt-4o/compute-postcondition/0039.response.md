Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order within the range [1, 10^9], assigned is a set containing elements from list a, element at index i, m is either 2 or 3, i is incremented by 1, assigned has at least 1 element, i is less than n, x is the next element in the set assigned that has not been processed yet, a[i] - x is not in assigned. If a[i] - x is in assigned, can_form is True and the loop breaks.***
