Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The values of the integers in the list `a` are distinct positive integers and each integer is between 1 and 10^9. Sorting the list does not change the values of the integers in the list, it only rearranges them in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 23, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 23, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
