According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `assigned`. If `assigned` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `can_form` is False, `m` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 1 do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `assigned` is not empty, `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`assigned` is not empty, `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
