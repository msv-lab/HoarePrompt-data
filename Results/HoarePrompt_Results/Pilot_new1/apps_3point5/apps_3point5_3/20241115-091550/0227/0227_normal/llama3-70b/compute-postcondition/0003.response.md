Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `m` is now `1`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 23, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 23, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1**
