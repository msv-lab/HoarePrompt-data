Output State: *n is greater than 1, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is an integer. If the element at index i in list a is not twice the element at index i-1, m is increased by 1. The loop will execute at least once as long as n is greater than 1. If n is 1, the loop does not execute and m remains 1.*
