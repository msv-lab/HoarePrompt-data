Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`.
- It sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
- Then, it iterates through the list to count how many elements are not twice the previous element.
- The function prints the count `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
- The output hints also agree with the code and accurately describe the functionality of the program.
