Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `assigned` contains the elements of list `a`, `x` iterates over each element in `assigned`, `m` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `can_form` is False if there are no elements in `assigned` or no element `a[i]` in `a` such that `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`.***
