Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The list `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers. After sorting, the list `a` is now in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order**
