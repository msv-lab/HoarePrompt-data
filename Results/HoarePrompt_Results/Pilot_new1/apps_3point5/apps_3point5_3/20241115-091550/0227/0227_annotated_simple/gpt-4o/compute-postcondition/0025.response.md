According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` contains the elements of list `a` one by one, `m` is either increased by 1 or remains 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `can_form` is True if the difference between the element at index `i` of list `a` and `x` is in `assigned` for any `x` in `assigned`, otherwise `can_form` remains False.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1
- `n` needs to be greater than the new value of `i`

State: **`assigned` contains the elements of list `a` one by one, `m` is either increased by 1 or remains 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, and `can_form` reflects the conditions specified above**
