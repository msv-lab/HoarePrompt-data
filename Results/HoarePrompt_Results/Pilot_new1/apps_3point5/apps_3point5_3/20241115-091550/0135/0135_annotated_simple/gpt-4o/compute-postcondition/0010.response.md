Example Answer: 
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo `i`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, `i` (adjusted to be less than the original value), `remainder` are integers. After execution, the value of `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `i` (adjusted to be less than the original value), `remainder` are integers.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `i` (adjusted to be less than the original value), `remainder` are integers**
