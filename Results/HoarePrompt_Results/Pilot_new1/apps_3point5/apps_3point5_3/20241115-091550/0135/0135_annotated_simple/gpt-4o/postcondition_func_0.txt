The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters n and k, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.
- If n is 0 or k is 0, the function does not execute the loop and returns 'No'.
- During the loop execution, the function calculates the remainder of n divided by i for i ranging from 1 to k. If a previously seen remainder is encountered, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it adds the unique remainders to a set.
- If the loop completes without encountering repeated remainders, the function returns 'Yes'.
