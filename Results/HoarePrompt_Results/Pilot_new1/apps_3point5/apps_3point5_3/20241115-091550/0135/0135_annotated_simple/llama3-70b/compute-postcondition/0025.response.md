Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then iterates over numbers from 1 to `k` and calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each number. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits the program. If no repeated remainders are found, it prints 'Yes'. If `k` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. The function does not have any return value.**
