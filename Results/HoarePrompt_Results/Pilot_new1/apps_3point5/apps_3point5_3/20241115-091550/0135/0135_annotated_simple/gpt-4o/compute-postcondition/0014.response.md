Output State: 
- If `n` is 0 or `k` is 0, the loop won't execute. In this case, `remainder` is not defined, and `seen_remainders` is an empty set.
- If the loop executes, `n`, `k`, `i` are integers, and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders encountered during the loop iterations. `i` decreases in each iteration, and the loop stops when `i` is less than the original value of `k`.
