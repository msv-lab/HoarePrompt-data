According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `i` (further decreased), `remainder` are integers, where `i` is less than the original value of `k` and `k` is greater than the adjusted `i`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to one more than the current value of `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `k`, `i+1`, `remainder` where `i+1` is less than the original value of `k` and `k` is greater than the adjusted `i+1`**
