Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1. `seen` is a set containing the remainder values of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` from 1 to `k`. `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `k` and is in `seen`, `remainder` has been added to `seen`, `i` is `k+1`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits.**
