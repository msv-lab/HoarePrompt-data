Output State: 
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute, and the function returns 'No'. 
- If k is less than n, the loop will execute k times. 
- After the loop executes, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainders seen so far, `i` is the number of iterations, `remainder` is a value between 0 and k. 
- If any `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. 
- Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged after the execution of the loop.
