Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the values of `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, the output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
