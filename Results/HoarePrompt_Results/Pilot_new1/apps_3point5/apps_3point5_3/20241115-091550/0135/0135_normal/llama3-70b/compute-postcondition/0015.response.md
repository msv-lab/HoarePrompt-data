According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing 0 or 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
