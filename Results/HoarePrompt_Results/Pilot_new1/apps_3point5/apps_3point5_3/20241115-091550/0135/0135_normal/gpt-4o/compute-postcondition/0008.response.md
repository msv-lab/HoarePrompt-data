Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainders seen so far, `i` is 1, `remainder` is a value between 0 and 1. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged after the execution of the program fragment.***
