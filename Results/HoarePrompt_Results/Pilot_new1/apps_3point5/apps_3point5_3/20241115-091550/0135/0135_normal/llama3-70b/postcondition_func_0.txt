The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, then iterates from 1 to `k`. For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If any remainder is already in the set `seen`, it prints 'No' and exits the program. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set `seen`. After the loop, if no duplicate remainders were found, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. If `k` is less than 1 or `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute.
