Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. If k is less than n, the function iterates k times, adding the remainder of n divided by i to the set of seen remainders each time. After the loop executes, if k is less than n, the function returns 'Yes'.**
