Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 2. The value of `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, so `remainder` is updated accordingly. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` contains `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is updated based on the loop body.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` contains `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is updated based on the loop body**
