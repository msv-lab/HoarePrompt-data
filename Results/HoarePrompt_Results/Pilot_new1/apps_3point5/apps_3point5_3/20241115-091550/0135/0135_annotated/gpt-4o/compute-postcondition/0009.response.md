According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and remainder is the result of n % i. If the remainder of n divided by i is in the set of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, and `seen_remainders` needs to be updated with the current remainder.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder of n % i, `i` is 2**
