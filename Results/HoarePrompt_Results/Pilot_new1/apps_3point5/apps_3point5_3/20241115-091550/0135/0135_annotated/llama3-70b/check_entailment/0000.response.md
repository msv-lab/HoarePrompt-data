Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder repeats. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of how the code works, detailing the purpose of the loop and the conditions for printing 'No'. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description align with the logic of the code, ensuring that it covers all potential cases as required by the problem statement. Hence, the code is correct.
