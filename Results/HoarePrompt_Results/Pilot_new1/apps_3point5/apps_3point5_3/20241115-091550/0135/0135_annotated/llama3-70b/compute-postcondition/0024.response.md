The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the value of n^k. The function assumes that n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the result of n^k where n and k are positive integers within the specified range.
