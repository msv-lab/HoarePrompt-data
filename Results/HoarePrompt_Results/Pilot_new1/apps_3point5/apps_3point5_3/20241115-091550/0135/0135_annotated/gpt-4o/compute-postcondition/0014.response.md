Output State: 
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop will not execute and the function will return 'No'.
- If k is less than n, the loop will iterate k times, adding the remainder of n divided by i to the set of seen remainders each time. 
- After the loop executes, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainders of n % i for each i in the range [1, k], i is the last value of the iteration, and remainder is the remainder of n % i for that last value of i.
