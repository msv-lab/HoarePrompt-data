Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for n and k, then iterates through all integers from 1 to k inclusive, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. It then checks if the calculated remainder has been seen before by storing it in a set. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". This logic ensures that the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
