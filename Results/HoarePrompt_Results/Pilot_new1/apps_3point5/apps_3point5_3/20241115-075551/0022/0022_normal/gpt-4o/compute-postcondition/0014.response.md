The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. 

Case_1: If the length of string `s` is odd, the loop does not execute. If the length of string `s` is even, the loop checks if the characters at the corresponding indices in `s` are equal up to the middle of the string. If any pair of characters does not match, the function returns False.

Case_2: The program returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, and based on the conditions described above, it returns either True or False.
