Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string provided by the user with a length of at least 2. `n` is the length of `s`. If there exists an index `i` such that `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks. This indicates that the input string `s` is not a palindrome. Otherwise, if `s` is a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` remains True and the program continues.***
