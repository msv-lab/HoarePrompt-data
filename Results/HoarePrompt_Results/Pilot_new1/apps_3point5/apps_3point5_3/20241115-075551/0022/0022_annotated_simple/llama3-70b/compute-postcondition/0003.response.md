According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. At the start of the loop, `is_spalindrome` is True. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is 0.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
