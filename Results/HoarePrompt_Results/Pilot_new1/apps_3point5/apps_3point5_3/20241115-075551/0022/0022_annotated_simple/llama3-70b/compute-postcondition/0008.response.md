According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. If the characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1` in string `s` are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken. This means that the loop will execute again only if the characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1` are equal.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- If the characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1` are equal, then `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next pair of characters in the string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 1**
