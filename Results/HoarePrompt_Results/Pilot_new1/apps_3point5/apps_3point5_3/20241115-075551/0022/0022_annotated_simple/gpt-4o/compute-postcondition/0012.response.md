Output State: *s is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is at most n // 2 - 1. If s[i] is not equal to s[n - 1 - i] at any point during the loop, the function returns False. This loop checks if the string s is a palindrome by comparing characters at symmetric positions within the string. If the loop completes without encountering any unequal characters, the function returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the function returns False.**
