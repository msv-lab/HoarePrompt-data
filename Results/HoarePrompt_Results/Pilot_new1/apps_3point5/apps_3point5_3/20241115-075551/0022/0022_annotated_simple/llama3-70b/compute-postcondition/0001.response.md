Example Answer:
The length of the input string `s` is calculated and assigned to variable `n`. The value of `n` is equal to the length of the input string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`**
