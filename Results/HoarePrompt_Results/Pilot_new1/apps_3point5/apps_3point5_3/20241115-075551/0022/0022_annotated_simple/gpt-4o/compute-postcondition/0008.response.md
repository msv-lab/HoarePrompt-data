According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **s is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 2**
