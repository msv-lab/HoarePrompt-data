According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 3, as it is currently 2 and less than half of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False, `i` is 3**
