According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `(n // 2)`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `(n // 2) - 2`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `(n // 2) - 1` to satisfy the condition `i < n // 2`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `(n // 2) - 1`**
