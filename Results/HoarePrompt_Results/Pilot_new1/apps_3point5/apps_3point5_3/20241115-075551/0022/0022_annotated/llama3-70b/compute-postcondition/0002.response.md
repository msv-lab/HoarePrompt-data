Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True**
