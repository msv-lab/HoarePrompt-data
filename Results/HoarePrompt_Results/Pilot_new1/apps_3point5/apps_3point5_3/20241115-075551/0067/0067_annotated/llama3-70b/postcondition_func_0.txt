The function takes three non-negative integers x, y, and z as input, compares them, and prints different symbols based on the comparisons. If x is greater than the sum of y and z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y, it prints '-'. If x equals y and z is 0, it prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, it prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, it prints '?'.
