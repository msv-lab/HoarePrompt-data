Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`; and the maximum upvotes value is less than the minimum downvotes value***
