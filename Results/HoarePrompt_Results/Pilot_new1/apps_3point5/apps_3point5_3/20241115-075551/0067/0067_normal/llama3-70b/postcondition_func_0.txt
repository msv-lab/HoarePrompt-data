The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It then checks various conditions based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` and prints different symbols ('+', '-', '0', '?') accordingly. If `x > y + z`, it prints '+'. If `x < y`, it prints '-'. If `x == y`, it further checks if `z == 0` and prints '0' in that case, otherwise it prints '?'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, it prints '?'. The function does not have a return value.
