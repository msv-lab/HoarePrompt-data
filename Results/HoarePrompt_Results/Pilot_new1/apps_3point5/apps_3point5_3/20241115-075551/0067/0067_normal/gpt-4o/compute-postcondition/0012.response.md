Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The values of `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` are assigned as x and x + z respectively. The values of `min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes` are assigned as y and y + z respectively. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false. After the execution of the if else block, the program will print either '+' if max_downvotes < min_upvotes is true or '?' if it is false. This covers all possible scenarios for the given variables and conditions.***
