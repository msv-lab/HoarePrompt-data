Example Answer: 
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the values assigned to them will also be within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
