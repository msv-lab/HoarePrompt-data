Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that is True if all color counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts` list. `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `j` is equal to `i`. `window_counts` is a dictionary where each color count matches the target count specified in the `counts` list. If the condition in the if statement is met, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
