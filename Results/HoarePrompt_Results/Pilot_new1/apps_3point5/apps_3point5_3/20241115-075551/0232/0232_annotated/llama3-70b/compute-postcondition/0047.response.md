Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1, values in `window_counts` are all equal to their corresponding target values after sorting, `j` is less than `n+1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding target values, `found` remains True and the loop breaks. All edge cases, including the initial conditions and potential variations in the values of `window_counts`, `counts`, and `colors`, are covered in the postcondition.***
