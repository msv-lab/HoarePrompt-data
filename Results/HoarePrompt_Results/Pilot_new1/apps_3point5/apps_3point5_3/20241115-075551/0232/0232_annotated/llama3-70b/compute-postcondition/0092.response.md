Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0. All other variables and conditions remain the same as the precondition.***
