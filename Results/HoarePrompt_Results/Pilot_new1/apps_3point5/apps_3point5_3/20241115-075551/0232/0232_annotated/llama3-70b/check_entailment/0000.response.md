Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input data correctly and processes it as described in the problem statement. It iterates through the colors of lightsabers to check if there is a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights with the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. If such an interval is found, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The code logic aligns with the problem description, and there are no edge cases identified where the program would not behave as expected. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the code's functionality, which further confirms that the program is correct.
