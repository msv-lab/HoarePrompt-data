Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is set to 1. The variables `n`, `i`, `j+1`, and `color` maintain their initial conditions. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if statement, `found` is True, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. Additionally, if `color` was not in `window_counts`, it is now added with a count of 1. The variables `n`, `i`, `j+1`, and `color` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
