Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, the dictionary window_counts is updated where each color key has a corresponding value incremented by 1. The variable i remains as 1, n is maintained as a non-negative value. If colors[j+1] is not already in window_counts, it is added with a value of 0. All values in window_counts are sorted and match their corresponding values in counts. If a color is not present in window_counts, it is added with a value of 0. The variable found is set to True if all counts in window_counts match their corresponding targets in counts; otherwise, found remains False.***
