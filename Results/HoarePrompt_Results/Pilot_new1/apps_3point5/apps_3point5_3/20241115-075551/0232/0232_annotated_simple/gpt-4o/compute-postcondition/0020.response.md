According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the count of the color at index `right` in `colors` was increased by 1 in `current_counts`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `right` needs to be adjusted to `right + 1` and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The count of the color at index `right + 1` in `colors` is increased by 1 in `current_counts`**
