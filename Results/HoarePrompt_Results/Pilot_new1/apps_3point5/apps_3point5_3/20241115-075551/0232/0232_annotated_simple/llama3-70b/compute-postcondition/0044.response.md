Output State: **colors is a list of integers with at least 1 color, counts is a list of integers, color_counts is a dictionary where each color in colors is a key with its count incremented by 1 or added with a count of 1 if not present, found is True, n is greater than 0, window_counts is a dictionary where color not in it is assigned a count of 0, i is less than n, j is less than n + 1, color is the color at index j in the colors list, window_counts[color] is incremented by 3. If color is not already in window_counts, it is added with a count of 1. If all counts in window_counts are equal to the corresponding counts in the counts list, then found is set to True and the loop breaks. `color` is assigned the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. After the if statement, if color is not in window_counts, it is added to window_counts with a count of 0, ensuring that all colors have an entry in window_counts.**
