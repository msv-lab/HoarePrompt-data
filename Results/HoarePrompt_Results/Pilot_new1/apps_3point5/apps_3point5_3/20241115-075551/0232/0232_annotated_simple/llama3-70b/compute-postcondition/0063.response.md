Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 color, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each color in `colors` is a key with its count incremented by 1 or added with a count of 1 if not present, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `n`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as a key and its count incremented by 1 if `color` was already present or added with a count of 1 if not present, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. The counts of colors in `window_counts` match the counts in the `counts` list after sorting. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
