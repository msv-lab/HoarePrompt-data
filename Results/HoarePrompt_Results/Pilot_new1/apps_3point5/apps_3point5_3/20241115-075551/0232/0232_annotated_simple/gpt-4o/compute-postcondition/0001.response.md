Example Answer:
`current_counts` is assigned a defaultdict with default value 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are colors of lightsabers and values are desired counts; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are colors of lightsabers and values are desired counts; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0**
