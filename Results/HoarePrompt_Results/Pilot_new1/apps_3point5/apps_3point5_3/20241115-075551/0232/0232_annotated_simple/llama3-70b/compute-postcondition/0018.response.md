Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 color, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each color in `colors` is a key with its count incremented by 1. If a color is not already in `color_counts`, it is added with a count of 1. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary.**
