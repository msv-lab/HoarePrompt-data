Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts`. It then creates a dictionary `color_counts` with the count of each color. Following this, it iterates through windows of colors and checks if the counts match the target counts. If a match is found, it sets `found` to True and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if a match was found, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value. Potential edge cases to consider are when `colors` or `counts` are empty lists, which affect the loop execution and the final output.**
