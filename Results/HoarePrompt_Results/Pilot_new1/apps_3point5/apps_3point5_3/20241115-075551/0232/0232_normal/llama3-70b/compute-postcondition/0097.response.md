Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. The variables `colors`, `n`, `i`, `color`, and `j` retain their initial values. The count of `color` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1. In all other cases, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
