Example Answer:
`counts` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split based on spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and `colors` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input**
