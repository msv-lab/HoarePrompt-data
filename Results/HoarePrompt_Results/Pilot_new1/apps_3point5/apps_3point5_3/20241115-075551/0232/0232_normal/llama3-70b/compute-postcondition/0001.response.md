Example Answer:
The list `colors` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of integers**
