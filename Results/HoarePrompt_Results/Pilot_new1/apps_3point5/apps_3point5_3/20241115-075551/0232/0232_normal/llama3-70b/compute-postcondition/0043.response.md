Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, the program maintains the following state: `n` is still greater than 0, `colors` remains non-empty, `color_counts` is a dictionary with counts initialized to 0 for each color, `found` remains True, `window_counts` is updated with the count of `color` set to 0 if `color` was not present in `window_counts`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated with the count of `color` set to 1.***
