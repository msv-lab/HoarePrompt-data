Functionality: **The function `func` reads input data consisting of the number of colors, the colors themselves, and the desired counts for each color. It then populates a dictionary `color_counts` with the frequency of each color. After that, it iterates through a range of values to check if the counts of colors in a window match the desired counts. If a match is found, it sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if a match is found, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
