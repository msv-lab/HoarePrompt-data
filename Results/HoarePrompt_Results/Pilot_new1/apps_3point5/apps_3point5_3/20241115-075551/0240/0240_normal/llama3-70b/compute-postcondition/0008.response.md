Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is either an empty string `''` or contains characters based on the conditions met by `c` in the next iteration. If the character `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` is appended with `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.***
