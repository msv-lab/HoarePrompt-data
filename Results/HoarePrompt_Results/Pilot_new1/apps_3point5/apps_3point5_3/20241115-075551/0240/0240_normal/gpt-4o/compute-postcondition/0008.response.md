Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no output. Ensure that all possible cases, including edge cases, are considered for the postcondition.***
