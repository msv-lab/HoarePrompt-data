Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two string parameters `s` and `t`, iterates through `s` to find characters present in `t`, concatenates `t` to the result, and returns the integer value of the concatenated string 'n'. If `t` is empty, the function will return 0 as an integer. The code handles the case where `t` is empty and correctly concatenates the strings to form the smallest possible integer `n`. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
