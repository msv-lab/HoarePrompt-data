Functionality: **The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a string containing the digits of a number, and `sub`, a substring of the number. It generates permutations of `chars`, forms a `candidate` by joining them, and checks if `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`. If valid, it yields `candidate`. If `chars` is empty or `sub` is not a substring of the number, the function does not execute the loop. If no valid number is found, there is no output after the loop finishes.**
