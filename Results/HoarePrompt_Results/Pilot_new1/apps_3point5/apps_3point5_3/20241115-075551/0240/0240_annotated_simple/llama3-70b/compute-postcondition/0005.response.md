Postcondition: ***`t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character in the string `s`. If the first character `c` is present in the set `t_set`, then `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
