The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. `chars` is a string representing characters, and `sub` is a substring that must be included in the generated numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of all possible numbers that can be generated using the characters in `chars` while ensuring that the substring `sub` is included in the number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: chars (a string of characters) and sub (a substring). It returns a list of all possible numbers that can be generated using the characters in chars while ensuring that the substring sub is included in the number.**
