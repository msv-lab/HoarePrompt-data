Example Answer:
If any character in the string `s` is present in the set `t_set`, then that character is concatenated to the existing value of `n`. If the string `s` is empty or none of its characters are present in the set `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is concatenated with characters from `s` that are in `t_set` or remains unchanged**
