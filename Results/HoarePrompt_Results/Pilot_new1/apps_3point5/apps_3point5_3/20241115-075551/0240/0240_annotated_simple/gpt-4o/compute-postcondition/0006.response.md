Example Answer: 
The string `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together. Since `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, `candidate` will be the next permutation of the characters in `chars` represented as a string. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`**
