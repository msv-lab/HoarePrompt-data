Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is created by converting the string `t` into a set. The set `t_set` will contain unique digits present in the string `t`. Since `t` only contains digits, the set `t_set` will contain unique digit characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string t.
Output State: **`t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string t**
