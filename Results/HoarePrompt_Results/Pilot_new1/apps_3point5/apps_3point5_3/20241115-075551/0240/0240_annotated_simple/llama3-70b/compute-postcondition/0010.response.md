Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, where `c` is the next character in the string `s`. The previous value of `n` is unknown, and `c` is a character from the string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`.
Output State: **`t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`**
