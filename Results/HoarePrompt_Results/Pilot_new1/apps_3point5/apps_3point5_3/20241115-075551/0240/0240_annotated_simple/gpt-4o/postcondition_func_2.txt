The function generate_possible_numbers takes two parameters: chars (a string of characters) and sub (a substring). It iterates over all permutations of the characters in chars and constructs a candidate string by joining these characters. If the candidate string passes the validity check with respect to the substring sub using the function is_valid_number(candidate, sub), then the function yields the candidate. The overall functionality is to generate all possible numbers that can be formed using the characters in chars while ensuring that the substring sub is included in the number.
