The function accepts two strings `num_str` and `sub`, along with an integer `n_len`, and returns True if the substring `sub` is present in `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`. Otherwise, it returns False. However, the code is missing the definition or input of `n_len`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
