The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `t`. The parameter `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `t` is a substring of `s` which can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, the program returns the integer value of 'n' after updating it based on the characters in 't' present in 's'.
