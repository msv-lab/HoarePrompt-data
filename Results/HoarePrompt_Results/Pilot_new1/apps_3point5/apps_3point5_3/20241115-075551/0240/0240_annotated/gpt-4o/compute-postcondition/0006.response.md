Example Answer:
The string `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together. Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, the value of `candidate` will be the next permutation of the digits in `chars`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`**
