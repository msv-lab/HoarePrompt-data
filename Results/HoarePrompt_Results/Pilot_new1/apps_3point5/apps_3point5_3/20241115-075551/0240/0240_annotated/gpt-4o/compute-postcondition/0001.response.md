Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the permutation of `chars`, which is represented by `perm`. The value of `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, so `candidate` is a string that represents a permutation of the digits in `chars`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`**
