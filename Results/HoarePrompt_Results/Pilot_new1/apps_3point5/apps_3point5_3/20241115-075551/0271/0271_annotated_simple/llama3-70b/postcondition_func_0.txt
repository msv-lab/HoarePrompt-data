The function `func` reads an integer input `n` from the user. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` minus the last digit. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it prints `n` plus the difference between 10 and the last digit, resulting in a multiple of 10. The function covers all cases for non-negative integers where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
