Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is determined based on the value of `n` and `remainder` according to the given conditions. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`. After the calculation, the value of `result` is printed. 
Output State: **The value of `result` is printed based on the conditions mentioned above.**
