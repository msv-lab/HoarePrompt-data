Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly rounds the input number `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 and then adjusts the result based on the value of the remainder. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from the input number to get the rounded result. If the remainder is greater than 5, it adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to the input number to get the rounded result. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description for all potential cases. The code handles the scenarios where the remainder is less than or equal to 5 and where it is greater than 5, providing the correct output in each case. The output hints also confirm that the code is functioning as expected by describing the same logic used in the code. Since the code adheres to the problem description and the output hints validate its correctness, we can conclude that the code is correct.
