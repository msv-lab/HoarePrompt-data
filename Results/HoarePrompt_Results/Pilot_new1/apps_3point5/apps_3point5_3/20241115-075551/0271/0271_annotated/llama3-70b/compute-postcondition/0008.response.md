Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer that is not divisible by 10. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, then the program prints `n` with the units digit removed. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is greater than 5, then the program prints `n` incremented to the nearest multiple of 10. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the given program fragment.***
