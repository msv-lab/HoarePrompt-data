Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer input `n` from the user, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, modifies `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. The function then prints the resulting value `result`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
