Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem description. It calculates the remainder when dividing the input number `n` by 10 and then rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10 based on the value of the remainder. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, where the result can be either `n - remainder` or `n + (10 - remainder)`. The annotations also align with the code's logic and provide a clear explanation of how the rounding is done. Overall, the code works correctly for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
