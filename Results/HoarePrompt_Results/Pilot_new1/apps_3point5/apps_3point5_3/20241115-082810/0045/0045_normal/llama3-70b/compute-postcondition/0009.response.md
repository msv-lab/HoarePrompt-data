Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is greater than 0, the function correctly computes the GCD and returns it. If either `a` or `b` is less than or equal to 0, the function does not execute the loop and returns the initial value of `a`. **
