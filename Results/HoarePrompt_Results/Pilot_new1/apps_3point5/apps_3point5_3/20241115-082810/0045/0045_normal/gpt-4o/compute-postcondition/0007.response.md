According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and `sequence`. If `k` is at least 1 and `sequence` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `min_sum` being greater than `n` does not affect the loop execution directly, so it does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1, `sequence` must not be empty, `i` is equal to `k - 1`.
State: **If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range of `k`, `k` is at least 1, `sequence` is not empty, `i` is equal to `k - 1**
