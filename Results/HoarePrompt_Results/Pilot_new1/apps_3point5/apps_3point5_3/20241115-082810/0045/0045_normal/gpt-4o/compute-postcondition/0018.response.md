According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `k-1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, which means `i` is within the range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i`. 

The condition for the loop to break out is when `remainder` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `remainder` is equal to -2, which means the loop did not break out. However, if the loop is to execute one more time, `remainder` needs to be adjusted to 0.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **Output State: If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range of `k`, where `k` is at least 1, `sequence` is not empty, `i` is equal to `k - 2` and `remainder` is equal to 0.**
