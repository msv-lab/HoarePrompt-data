According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b`. If `b` evaluates to `True`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` have new values based on the initial values. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `b` should be adjusted to evaluate to `True` at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` have new values based on the initial values, and `b` evaluates to `True`**
