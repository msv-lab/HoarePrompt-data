According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is within the range specified by the loop statement. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1) + 1)` for each `i` in the range `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be within the range specified by the loop statement, which is from `k - 1` to -1. So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be `k - 2`.

State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1) + 1)` for each `i` in the range `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k - 2`**
