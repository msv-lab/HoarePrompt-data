Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum sum of integers from 1 to `k`, checks if this sum is greater than `n`, and returns -1 if it is. Otherwise, it creates a sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum is equal to `n` and maximizes the greatest common divisor. The program handles the scenario where there are multiple possible sequences by adjusting the elements of the sequence based on the remainder. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the program logic and the state of variables at different points in the code, aiding in understanding how the program achieves the desired outcome. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples.
