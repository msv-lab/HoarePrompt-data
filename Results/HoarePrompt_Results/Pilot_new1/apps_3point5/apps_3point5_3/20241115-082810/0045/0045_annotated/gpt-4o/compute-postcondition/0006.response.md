Example Answer:
The list `sequence` is created by multiplying each element `(i + 1)` in the range `k` by `d`. The initial state variables `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the calculated value of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range `k`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the calculated value of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range `k`**
