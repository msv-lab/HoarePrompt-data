According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `b` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are positive integers and `b` is a non-zero positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `b` needs to be adjusted to be positive and non-zero.
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `b` is a non-zero positive integer**
