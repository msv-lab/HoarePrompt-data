According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `k-1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is greater than `n`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k-2`, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `k-3` to ensure it falls within the range of `k-1` to 0.
