The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates `min_sum` based on the value of `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it computes the values of `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` based on the calculations specified in the code. The function then returns the list 'sequence' after the loop execution. If `k` is 0 or less, or if `remainder` is 0 before the loop starts, the loop does not execute.
