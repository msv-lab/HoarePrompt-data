Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the minimum sum required for a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers from 1 to k. If this minimum sum is greater than n, the program returns -1 as expected.
2. The program then calculates the value of d by dividing n by the minimum sum. It also calculates the remainder by subtracting d times the minimum sum from n.
3. It generates a sequence of k positive numbers where each element is d times (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1.
4. If there is a remainder left after generating the sequence, the program increments the last k elements of the sequence by 1 to adjust for the remainder.
5. The program then returns the resulting sequence which satisfies the conditions of being strictly increasing and having the maximal greatest common divisor.
6. The program handles the case where there is no possible sequence by returning -1, as required by the problem description.
7. Based on the provided examples and the logic of the program, it seems to correctly solve the given problem for all potential cases.
