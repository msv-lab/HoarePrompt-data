Example Answer:
Initially, `a` is the original value of `b`, and `b` is the remainder of `a` divided by the original `b`. After executing the code `a, b = b, a % b`, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `b` is assigned the remainder of the original `b` divided by the original `a` modulo the original `b`. Since `b` is not equal to 0, the code will execute successfully.
Output State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the original `b` divided by the original `a` modulo the original `b` and `b` is not equal to 0**
