According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `b` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is the remainder of the original `b` divided by the original `a` modulo the original `b` and `b` is not equal to 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to a value that is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the original `b` divided by the original `a` modulo the original `b` and `b` is not equal to 0**
