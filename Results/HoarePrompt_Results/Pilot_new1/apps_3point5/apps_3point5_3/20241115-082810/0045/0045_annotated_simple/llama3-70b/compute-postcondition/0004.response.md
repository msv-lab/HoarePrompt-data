Example Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` are reassigned new values based on the original values of `b` and `a`. The new value of `a` is the original value of `b`, and the new value of `b` is the remainder of the original `b` divided by the original `a` modulo the original `b`. Since `b` is not equal to 0, the calculation is valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the new value of `b`, `b` is the new value of `a` modulo the new value of `b`.
Output State: **`a` is the new value of `b`, `b` is the new value of `a` modulo the new value of `b`**
