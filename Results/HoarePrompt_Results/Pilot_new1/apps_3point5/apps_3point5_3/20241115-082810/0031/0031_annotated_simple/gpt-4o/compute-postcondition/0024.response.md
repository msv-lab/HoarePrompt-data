Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the return value of `func_1(A, B)`, where `A` is undefined, and `B` is equal to `p_total`. The return value of `func_1` will depend on its implementation. Therefore, the output state is: `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `A` is assigned an undefined value, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the return value of `func_1(A, B)`.
Output State: **`p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `A` is assigned an undefined value, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the return value of `func_1(A, B)`**
