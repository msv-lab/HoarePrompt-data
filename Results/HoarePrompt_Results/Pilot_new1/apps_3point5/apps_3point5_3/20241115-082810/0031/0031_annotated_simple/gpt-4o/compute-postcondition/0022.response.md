Example Answer:
`A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `p_shared` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `A` is assigned an undefined value. The state of other variables remains the same. 
Output State: **`p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `A` is assigned an undefined value**
