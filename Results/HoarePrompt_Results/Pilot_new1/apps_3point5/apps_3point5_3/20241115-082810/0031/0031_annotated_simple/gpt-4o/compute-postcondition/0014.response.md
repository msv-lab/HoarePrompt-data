According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 2.
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is assigned the value 2 raised to the power of n, numerator is assigned the value (1 * (total_days - 1) % MOD), denominator is assigned the value (1 * 2^n % MOD), `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, numerator is updated to the new value calculated by multiplying the current value of numerator with (total_days - i) and then taking the modulo MOD, denominator is updated to the new value calculated by multiplying the current value of denominator with total_days and then taking the modulo MOD**
