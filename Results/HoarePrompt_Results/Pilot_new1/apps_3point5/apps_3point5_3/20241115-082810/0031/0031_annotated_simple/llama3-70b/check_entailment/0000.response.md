Correctness: **False**

The provided code is incorrect because it is missing the `math` module import which is used in the code. Additionally, the code snippet provided is incomplete and does not include the necessary logic to calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday. 

The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not provide the correct output as per the problem description. The logic to calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday is missing. 

Therefore, based on the incomplete code and missing logic, the correctness of the program is false.
