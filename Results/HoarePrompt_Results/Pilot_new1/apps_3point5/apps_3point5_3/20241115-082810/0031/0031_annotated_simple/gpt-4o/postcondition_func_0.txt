The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters 'a' and 'b', calculates their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), and returns the GCD where 'b' becomes 0 after the loop execution. The function effectively implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 'a' and 'b'. It handles cases where 'b' is initially 0, ensuring 'a' is returned as the GCD without entering the loop.
