Example Answer:
`p_shared` is calculated by subtracting `p_no_shared` from `p_total`, adding `MOD`, and then taking the modulus of `MOD`. The previous values of `p_total` and `denominator` are unknown, so the final value of `p_shared` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.
Output State: **`p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`**
