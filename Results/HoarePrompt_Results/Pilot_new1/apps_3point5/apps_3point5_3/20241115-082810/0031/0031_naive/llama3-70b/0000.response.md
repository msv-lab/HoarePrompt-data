Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland for any given values of n and k. It follows the problem description by calculating the numerator and denominator based on the total number of days and the number of people to be interviewed. It then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form and prints the values modulo 10^6 + 3. The program handles all potential cases and works as expected.
