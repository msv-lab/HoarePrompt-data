Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`, where `A` is the calculated value of `p_shared` and `B` is the value of `p_total`. The previous values of `A` and `B` are unknown, so the output state is: `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the calculated value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the calculated value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
