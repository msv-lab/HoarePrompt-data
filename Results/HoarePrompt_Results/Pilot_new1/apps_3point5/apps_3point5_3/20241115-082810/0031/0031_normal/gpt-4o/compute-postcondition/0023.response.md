Example Answer: 
`B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`. The values of `p_no_shared` and `p_shared` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` has the updated value based on the condition, `p_total` retains its value, `p_shared` is calculated using the updated values, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` has the updated value based on the condition, `p_total` retains its value, `p_shared` is calculated using the updated values, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
