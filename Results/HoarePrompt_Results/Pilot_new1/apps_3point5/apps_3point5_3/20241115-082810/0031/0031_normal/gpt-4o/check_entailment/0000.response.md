Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly handles the input of n and k.
- It checks if k is greater than 2^n and prints 1 1 if so, which is in line with the problem description.
- It then calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday using the given formula and prints the irreducible fraction A and B modulo 10^6 + 3.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, including edge cases like k being greater than 2^n.
