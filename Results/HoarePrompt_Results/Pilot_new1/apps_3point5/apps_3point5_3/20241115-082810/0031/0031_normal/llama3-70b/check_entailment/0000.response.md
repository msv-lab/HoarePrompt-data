Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly takes the input values of `n` and `k`.
- The `func_1` function calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland correctly by computing the numerator and denominator based on the input values of `n` and `k`.
- It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`, updates both values by dividing them by the gcd, and finally returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3).
- The code handles the cases where `k` is 0 or negative, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs.
- The output hints also agree with the code and accurately describe the functionality of the `func_1` function.
