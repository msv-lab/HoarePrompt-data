According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated according to the formula r += shares * b[i], `i` is 2, `shares` is 0. Since `i` is 2, it needs to be adjusted to 3 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated according to the formula r += shares * b[i], `i` is 3, `shares` is 0**
