According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the values of `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` do not affect the loop execution directly. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged, `i` is 0**
