Example Answer: 
The list `b` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers from user input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers from user input**
