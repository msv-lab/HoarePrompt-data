Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is incremented by the result of `r` divided by `s[i]`. The previous values of `shares`, `r`, `s`, and `i` are known, so the calculation can be done directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are integers, `i` is 0, and `shares` is updated according to the formula.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are integers, `i` is 0, and `shares` is updated according to the formula**
