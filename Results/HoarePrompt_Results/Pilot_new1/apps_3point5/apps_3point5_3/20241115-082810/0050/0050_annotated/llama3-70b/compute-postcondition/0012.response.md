Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are integers. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the floor division of the original value of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division of `r` by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop. `i` remains 0 in all cases.***
