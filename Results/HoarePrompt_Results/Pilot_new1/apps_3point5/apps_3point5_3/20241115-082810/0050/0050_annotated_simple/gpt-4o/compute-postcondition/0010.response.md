Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_sell_price` is larger than `min_buy_price`, `max_shares` is an integer calculated by dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is a non-negative integer less than `min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`**
