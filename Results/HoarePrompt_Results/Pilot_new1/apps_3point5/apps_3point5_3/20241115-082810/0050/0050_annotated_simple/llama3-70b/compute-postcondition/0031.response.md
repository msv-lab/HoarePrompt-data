Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the positive integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and `shares` are updated. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and the element at index `i` of the sorted descending list `b`, and `shares` is set to 0. On the other hand, if `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks. All variables maintain their positive integer values, `s` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` remains a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `r` remains greater than or equal to all elements in the list `s`.***
