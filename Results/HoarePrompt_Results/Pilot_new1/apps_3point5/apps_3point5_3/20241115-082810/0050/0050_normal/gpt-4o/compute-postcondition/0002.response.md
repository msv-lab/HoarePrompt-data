Example Answer:
The list `b` is created by mapping the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input string. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, so the values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are now stored in the list `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string.
Output State: **`b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string**
