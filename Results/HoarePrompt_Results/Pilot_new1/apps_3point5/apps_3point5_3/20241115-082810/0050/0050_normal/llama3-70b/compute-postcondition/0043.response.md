Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After each iteration, shares will be increased by the integer division of r by the i-th element of sorted list s, and r will be updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r is less than s[i], the loop breaks. The final state will have n, m, r, shares as integers. If r is greater than or equal to the last element of sorted list s, shares will contain the total number of shares, otherwise, the loop will break. If n is 0 or less, the loop will not execute and shares will remain 0.**
