The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, then sorts two lists `s` and `b`. It iterates through the sorted list `s` and calculates the total number of shares based on the available resources `r`. If the resources allow, it distributes shares accordingly. After that, it iterates through the sorted list `b` and updates the available resources `r` based on the shares owned. Finally, it prints the remaining resources `r`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
