Example Answer:
The `total_bourles` is calculated by multiplying `max_shares` with `max_sell_price` and then adding `remaining_bourles`. The values of `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles` are dependent on the initial values of `r`, `min_buy_price`, `min_sell_price`, and `b`. After the calculation, the `total_bourles` variable holds the total value. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`, `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` holds the calculated total value.
Output State: **`b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`, `max_shares` is the result of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` holds the calculated total value**
