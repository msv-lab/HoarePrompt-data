Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which does not represent the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from x. The program does not perform the required operations to transform the triangle as described in the problem statement. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
