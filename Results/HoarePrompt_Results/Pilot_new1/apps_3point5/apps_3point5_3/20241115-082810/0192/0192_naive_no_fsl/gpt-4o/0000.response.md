Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The formula used in the program ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2) is valid for all potential cases within the given constraints. The program handles the logic of modifying the length of a single side of the triangle while ensuring it remains a non-degenerate triangle with integer side lengths.
