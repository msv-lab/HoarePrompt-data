Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. This aligns with the problem description, which states that Memory wants to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting from a triangle of side length `x` by modifying the sides to integers. The code handles this by simply finding the absolute difference between the two side lengths, which is the minimum number of seconds needed to reach the desired equilateral triangle. The code is correct for all potential cases and the output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
