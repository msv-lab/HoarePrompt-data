Example Answer:
The absolute difference between `x` and `y` is calculated using the `abs()` function, and the result is printed. The values of `x` and `y` are obtained from splitting the input, so the difference between them is calculated. 
Output State: **`x` and `y` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input, and the absolute difference between them is printed.**
