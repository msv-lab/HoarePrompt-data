Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input string after removing leading zeros using the `lstrip` method. The variable `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, so the value of `b` will be the same as the input string without leading zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is the input string without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is the input string without leading zeros**
