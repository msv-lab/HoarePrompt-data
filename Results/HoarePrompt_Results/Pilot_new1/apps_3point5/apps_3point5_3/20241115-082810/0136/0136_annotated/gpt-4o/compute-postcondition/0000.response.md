Example Answer:
The input is split into a list called `data`. Since the initial state does not specify any values for `a` and `b`, the output state will be `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits**
