Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. If `b` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='.***
