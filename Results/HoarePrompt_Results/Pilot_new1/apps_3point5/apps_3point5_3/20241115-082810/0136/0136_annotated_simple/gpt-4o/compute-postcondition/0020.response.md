Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros. If `a` was initially an empty string, it is set to '0'. If `b` was initially an empty string, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. The value of `a` is less than or equal to the value of `b`***
