Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input string after removing any leading zeros. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, the value of `b` will be the same as `a` after removing any leading zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is the same as `a` after removing any leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is the same as `a` after removing any leading zeros**
