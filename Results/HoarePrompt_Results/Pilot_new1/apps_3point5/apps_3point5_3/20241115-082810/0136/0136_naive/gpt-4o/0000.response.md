Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input as a whole line, which is suitable for very large integers.
2. It correctly removes any leading zeroes from the input numbers.
3. It compares the lengths of the input numbers first, and then compares the numbers themselves if the lengths are equal.
4. The comparisons are done correctly to determine whether a < b, a > b, or a = b.
5. The program covers all possible cases and provides the correct output.
