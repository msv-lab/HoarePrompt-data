Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads two very long integers a and b as strings, removes leading zeroes, and then compares them. It correctly follows the problem description by printing "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b. The program handles cases where a and b have leading zeroes and compares them as expected. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as described.
