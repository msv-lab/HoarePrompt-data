Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three inputs representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has. It then calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively. The code correctly finds the minimum number of lemons that can be used by taking the minimum of the three quantities divided by their respective ratios. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits needed to make the compote by multiplying the minimum number of lemons by the ratios for apples and pears, and then adding them up. 

The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code does not behave as expected.
