Functionality: **The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be bought based on the input values. The function computes the total cost of the lemons and prints the result, which is the sum of the minimum lemons needed at different prices. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
