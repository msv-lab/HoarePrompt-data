Example Answer:
`total_fruits` is calculated as the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4. `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a` divided by 2, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 4. The value of `a` is known to be an input integer between 1 and 1000. After calculating `max_lemons`, we find the minimum value among the divisions. Then, `total_fruits` is calculated as the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among a divided by 2, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4, and `total_fruits` is the sum of max_lemons multiplied by 1, 2, and 4.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among a divided by 2, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4, and `total_fruits` is the sum of max_lemons multiplied by 1, 2, and 4**
