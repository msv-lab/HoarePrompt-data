Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It calculates the minimum of the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and one-fourth of the number of pears to determine the limiting factor in making the compote. Then, it calculates the total number of fruits based on this limiting factor and prints the result. The logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, and the examples provided also produce the correct output.
