Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote by following the given ratios. It considers the minimum of each fruit type divided by the required ratio, then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used. The program handles the case where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote by setting the total fruits to 0. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
