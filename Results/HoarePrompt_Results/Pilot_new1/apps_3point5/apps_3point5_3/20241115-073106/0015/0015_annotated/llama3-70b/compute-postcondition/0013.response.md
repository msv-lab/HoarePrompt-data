Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with specific values based on the input. If `c` is equal to 0, then if `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, the program checks if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0). If this condition is true, 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the execution of the if-else block, including edge cases where `c` is 0, the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result is non-negative.***
