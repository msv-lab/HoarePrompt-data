The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. If `c` is 0, it prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it prints 'YES' if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function handles cases where `c` is 0, `a` is not equal to `b`, and the condition for `c` not being 0 is not satisfied. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
