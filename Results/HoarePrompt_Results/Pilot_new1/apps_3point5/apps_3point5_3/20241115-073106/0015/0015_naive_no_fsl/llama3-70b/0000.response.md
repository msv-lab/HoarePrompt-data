Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly handles the case where the difference between neighboring elements is 0. In this case, if the first element is equal to Vasya's favorite number, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
2. The program also correctly handles the case where the difference between neighboring elements is non-zero. It checks if the difference between Vasya's favorite number and the first element is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements and if the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
3. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
