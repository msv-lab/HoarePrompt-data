Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes a string `s` as input and iterates through the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces occurrences of that character in the input string `s` with the consecutive character until that character is no longer present in `s`. After iterating through the entire alphabet, if the resulting string `res` has a length of 26 (indicating that all characters from 'a' to 'z' are present in the string), it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. This matches the problem description, as the code aims to obtain a string that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of how the code works and what the final output will be based on the input string `s`. Since the code logic aligns with the problem requirements and the provided examples, the correctness is deemed to be true.
