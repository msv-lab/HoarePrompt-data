Example Answer:
The character 'a' in string `s` is replaced with the next character in the ASCII sequence, which is 'b', and the replacement is done only once. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b' once, `res` is a string containing the character 'a', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b' once, `res` is a string containing the character 'a', `char` is 'a'**
