According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is an integer between 0 and 26 where `j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `s` and `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than 26. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than 26 where `j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`**
