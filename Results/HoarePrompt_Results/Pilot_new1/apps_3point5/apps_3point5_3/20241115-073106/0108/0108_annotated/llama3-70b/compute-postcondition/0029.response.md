Example Answer:
'res' is appended with the value of 'char'. The previous values of 'res' and 'char' are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: If 'char' is in 's' then 'res' contains the characters added in each iteration, 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a' with the next character, 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's' and the next character in 's' after the last replacement is equal to 'char', 'res' is appended with 'char'.
Output State: **If 'char' is in 's' then 'res' contains the characters added in each iteration, 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a' with the next character, 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's' and the next character in 's' after the last replacement is equal to 'char', 'res' is appended with 'char'**
