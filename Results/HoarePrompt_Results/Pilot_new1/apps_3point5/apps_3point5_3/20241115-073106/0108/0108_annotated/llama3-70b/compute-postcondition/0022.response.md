Example Answer:
The character 'char' is replaced with the character following it in 's' using the `replace` function with a limit of 1 occurrence. The 'char' variable is then updated to the character that was replaced. The 'res' variable is updated by adding the replaced 'char' to it. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a', 'res' is updated accordingly with the addition of 'char', 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'.
Output State: **'s' is the updated string after replacing 'a', 'res' is updated accordingly with the addition of 'char', 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'**
