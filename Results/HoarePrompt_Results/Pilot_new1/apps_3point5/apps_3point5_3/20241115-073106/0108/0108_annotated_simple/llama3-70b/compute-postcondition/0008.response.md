Example Answer:
The `char` variable is replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence using `ord(char) + 1`. The `s` string has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character. Since `char` is already the next lowercase English letter, the replacement will be the letter after that. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the letter after the next lowercase English letter, `res` is the next lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the letter after the next lowercase English letter, `res` is the next lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter**
