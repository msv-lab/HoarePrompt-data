According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of `char` in `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is updated based on the addition of `char`, which means `char` was found in `s`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s` is updated based on the addition of `char`, `res` is updated based on the addition of `char`**
