According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of the `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is updated based on the addition of `char`, and `res` is updated based on the addition of `char`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `char` is still in the updated `s`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`s` is updated based on the addition of `char`, `res` is updated based on the addition of `char`**
