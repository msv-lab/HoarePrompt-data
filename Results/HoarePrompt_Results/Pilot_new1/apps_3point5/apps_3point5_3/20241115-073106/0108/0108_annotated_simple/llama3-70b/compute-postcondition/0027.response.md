Example Answer: 
The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The `replace` function updates `s` with the modified string. Therefore, after execution, the value of `res` is updated with the modified value of `char`.
Output State: **`res` is updated with the modified value of `char`**
