According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in ASCII sequence and `res` is also updated after replacing `char` with the next character in ASCII sequence. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in ASCII sequence; `char` is updated to the next character in ASCII sequence**
