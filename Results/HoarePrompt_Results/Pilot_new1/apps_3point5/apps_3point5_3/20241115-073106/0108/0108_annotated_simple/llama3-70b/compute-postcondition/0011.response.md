Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the letter after the next lowercase English letter. The value of `char` is incremented by 1 using `ord` and `chr` functions. As a result, the new value of `char` will be the letter following the original `char`. The other variables `res` and `char` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the letter after the next lowercase English letter, `res` is the next lowercase English letter followed by the next lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the letter after the next lowercase English letter, `res` is the next lowercase English letter followed by the next lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter**
