According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the letter after the next lowercase English letter, `res` is the next lowercase English letter, and `char` is the next lowercase English letter. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the letter after the next lowercase English letter, `res` is the next lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter**
