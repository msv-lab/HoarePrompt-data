Output State: **If `s` contains all characters of `target` in order, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to `target_len`. If `s` does not contain all characters of `target` in order, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, and `j` will be less than `target_len`. If `s` is shorter than `target`, `i` will be less than the length of `s`, and `j` will be less than `target_len`. If `s` is longer than `target`, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, and `j` will be less than `target_len`.**
