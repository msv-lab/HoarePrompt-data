Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a string `s` as input and checks if the characters in `s` are in the same order as the English alphabet. It iterates through both `s` and the target alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and if the characters match in order, it prints the target alphabet string. If the characters do not match in order or if `s` is shorter or longer than the target alphabet string, it prints -1. The program logic correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
