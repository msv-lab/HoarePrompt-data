According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is updated with the modified value of the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`, and `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the character following the current `char` in the ASCII sequence in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is updated with the modified value of the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`, `char` is updated to the character following the current `char` in the ASCII sequence in `s`**
