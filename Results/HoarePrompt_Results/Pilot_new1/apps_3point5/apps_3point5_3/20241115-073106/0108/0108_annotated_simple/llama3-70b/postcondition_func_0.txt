The function `func` reads a string `s` from input and iterates through the lowercase English alphabet. For each letter in the alphabet, it checks if that letter exists in `s`, and if so, it appends that letter to the result string `res` and replaces the letter in `s` with the next letter in the alphabet. If `res` contains all 26 lowercase English letters, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input string `s`. The functionality of the function is limited to processing the input string `s` and printing the result or -1 based on the contents of `s`.
