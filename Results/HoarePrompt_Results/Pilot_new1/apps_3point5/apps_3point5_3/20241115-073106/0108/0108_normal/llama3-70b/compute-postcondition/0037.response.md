Output State: **If `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, `s` will be an empty string, `res` will contain all characters in the `alphabet` string in order, and `char` will be the character after the last character in the `alphabet` string. If `s` does not contain all characters in the `alphabet` string, `res` will contain the characters in the `alphabet` string that were replaced in `s`, `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the last replaced character in `s`. If `s` is empty or does not contain all characters in the `alphabet` string, the loop does not execute, and `s`, `res`, and `char` remain unchanged.**
