Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced with the next ASCII character of `char` using the `replace` function with a limit of 1 replacement. The previous state of `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string with one character replaced with the next ASCII character. The `res` variable has been appended with an unknown character. After execution, the replaced character in `s` changes, and `res` remains the same with an additional unknown character.
Output State: **`s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string with one character replaced with the next ASCII character, `res` has been appended with an unknown character**
