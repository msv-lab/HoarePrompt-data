Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input and iterates through it. It compares each character of `s` with the characters in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `s` contains all characters from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in order, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Edge cases such as an empty string or characters from 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' not in order are handled by printing -1.**
