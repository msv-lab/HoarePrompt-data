Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. If `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `s` is not empty, and `res` contains the added `char`. If `s` does not contain all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `res` contains the characters in the `alphabet` string that were replaced in `s`, and `char` is updated to the next character in the `alphabet` string.
Output State: **`s` is updated based on the replacement, `res` contains the replaced characters, and `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet string**
