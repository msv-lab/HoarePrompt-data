Output State: **If `s` contains all characters in `target` in order, then `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to `target_len`. If `s` does not contain all characters in `target` in order, then `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is less than `target_len`. If `s` contains characters from `target` but not in order, then `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is less than `target_len`. If `s` does not contain any characters from `target`, then `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is 0. If `s` is an empty string, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
