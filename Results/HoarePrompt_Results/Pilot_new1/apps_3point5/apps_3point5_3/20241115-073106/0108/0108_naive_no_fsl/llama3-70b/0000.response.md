Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program iterates through the English alphabet and replaces each character with the next character in the input string until the entire alphabet is formed as a subsequence. If the length of the resulting string is 26 (the length of the English alphabet), then it prints the result. Otherwise, it prints -1. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the cases where it is impossible to form the English alphabet as a subsequence. The logic of the program is sound and it works for all possible inputs.
