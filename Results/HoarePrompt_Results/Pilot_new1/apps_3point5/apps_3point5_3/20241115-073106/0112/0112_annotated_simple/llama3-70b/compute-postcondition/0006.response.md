Example Answer:
The code updates the set `digits` by adding the string representation of each digit in the cube. Since the initial state mentions that `digits` contains the digits of the first cube, after running the code, the set `digits` will be updated to include the digits of all cubes in the list `cubes`. The variables `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits of all cubes in the list `cubes`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits of all cubes in the list `cubes`**
