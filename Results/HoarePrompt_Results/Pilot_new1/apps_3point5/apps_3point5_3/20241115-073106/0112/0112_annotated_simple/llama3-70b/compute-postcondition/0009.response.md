According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cubes`. If the list has at least 4 sublists, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers with at least 3 sublists, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from the cubes in the list `cubes`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `cubes` must have at least 4 sublists.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers with at least 4 sublists, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from the cubes in the list `cubes`**
