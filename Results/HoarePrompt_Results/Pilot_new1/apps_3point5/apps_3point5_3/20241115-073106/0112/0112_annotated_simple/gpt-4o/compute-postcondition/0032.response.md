The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num` as a parameter. It also has additional parameters `n` and `cube_faces` which are described in the constraints. 

After the loop executes, the function checks if a condition is satisfied and updates several variables (`used_cubes`, `digits`, `digit`, `found`, `n`). If the condition is met at least once during the loop execution, the function returns True. If the condition is not met at all, the function returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `num`, iterate through the list of cube faces, and return True if a specific condition is met during the loop execution. If the condition is not met at all, the function returns False.
