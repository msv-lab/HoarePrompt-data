According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 3 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, cube is the second cube in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 cubes and the cube should be the third cube in the list.
State: **`digits` is a set containing the individual digits of both cubes, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, `cube` is the third cube in the list**
