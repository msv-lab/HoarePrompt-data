Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the individual digits of all cubes in string format. If '0' is in `digits`, it is removed from the set. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. `max_num` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the sorted `digits` set in reverse order.**
