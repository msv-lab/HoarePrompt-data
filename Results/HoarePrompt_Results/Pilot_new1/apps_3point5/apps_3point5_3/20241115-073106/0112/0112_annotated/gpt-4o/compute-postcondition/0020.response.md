According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition inside the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if `used_cubes[i]` was False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `i` is 2, and the loop or if statement is exited after the condition is met. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be increased by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.
- The condition inside the loop must still hold true for the loop to continue, so `used_cubes[i]` should be False and `digit` should be in `cube_faces[i`.

State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if `used_cubes[i]` was False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `i` is 3**
