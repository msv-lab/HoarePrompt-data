Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element is True if `used_cubes[i]` was False and the corresponding `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit. If the loop does not execute at all, all variables remain unchanged. If `found` is False at any point, the program returns False.**
