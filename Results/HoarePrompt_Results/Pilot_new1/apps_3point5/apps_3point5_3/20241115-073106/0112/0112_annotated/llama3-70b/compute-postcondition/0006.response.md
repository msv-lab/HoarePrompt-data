Example Answer:
The set `digits` is updated to include the individual digits of the second cube `cube`. The previous state of `digits` contains the individual digits of the first cube. The set `digits` now contains the individual digits of both cubes. The list `cubes` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a set containing the individual digits of both cubes, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, `cube` is the second cube in the list.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the individual digits of both cubes, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, `cube` is the second cube in the list**
