Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The `can_form_number` function does not correctly handle the condition where Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the program may not accurately determine the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes as described in the problem. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
