Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input as described in the problem.
2. The program then defines a function `can_form_number` which checks if a given number can be formed using the cubes provided, taking into consideration the constraints mentioned in the problem description.
3. The main function `func_1` iterates to find the maximum number x that can be formed using the cubes provided.
4. The program then prints the output which is the maximum number x that can be formed.
5. The logic of the program seems to be correct and it is handling all the constraints and requirements mentioned in the problem description.
6. The program uses a brute force approach to find the maximum number x, which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.
