The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of cubes, and `cubes`, a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of each cube. The function iterates to find the smallest integer x for which `can_form_number(x)` returns false. If `can_form_number(1)` returns true, the function returns 0. However, there is a missing implementation detail in the code related to the `can_form_number` function, as it is not defined within the provided code snippet.
