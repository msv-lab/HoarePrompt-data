According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, the `num` must be a positive integer, `digits` list must have at least 1 digit, and each element in `used_cubes` list must be initialized to `False`. At the start of the loop, `digit` will be the first digit in the `digits` list.

State: **`digits` is a list of individual digits of the positive integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`, `num` is a positive integer, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list**
