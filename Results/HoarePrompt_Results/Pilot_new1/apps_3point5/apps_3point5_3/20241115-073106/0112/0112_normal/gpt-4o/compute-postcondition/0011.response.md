Example Answer:
The value at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list is set to True. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is updated with the value at index `i` set to True, `found` is True, and the loop or if statement is exited, `i` is less than the length of `used_cubes`.
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is updated with the value at index `i` set to True, `found` is True, and the loop or if statement is exited, `i` is less than the length of `used_cubes`**
