Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of individual digits of the positive integer `num` after converting it to a string. Since `num` is a positive integer, the list `digits` will contain individual digits of that integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of individual digits of the positive integer `num`.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of individual digits of the positive integer `num`**
