Output State: 
- If `num` is a positive integer and `digits` is a non-empty list of individual digits of `num`, the loop will iterate through each digit and try to match it with the cube faces in `cube_faces`. If a match is found, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` will be set to True. If a match is not found for any digit, `found` will remain False and the function will return False.
- If `num` is not a positive integer or `digits` is an empty list, the loop will not execute and the values of the variables will remain unchanged.
- If there are not enough cube faces in `cube_faces` (less than `n`), the loop may encounter an index out of range error.
