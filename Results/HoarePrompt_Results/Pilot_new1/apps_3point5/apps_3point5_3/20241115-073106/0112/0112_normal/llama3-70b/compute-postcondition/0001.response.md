Example Answer:
The code reads n lists of integers and stores them in the variable cubes as a list of lists. The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and stored in cubes. Since n is an input integer, the number of lists and their content can vary. Therefore, the output state is: n is an input integer, cubes is a list of n lists of integers.
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes is a list of n lists of integers**
