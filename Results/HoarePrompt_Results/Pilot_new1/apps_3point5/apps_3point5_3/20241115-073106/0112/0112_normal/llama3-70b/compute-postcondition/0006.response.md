Example Answer:
The set `digits` is updated with the string representation of each digit in the first cube. Since `digits` already contains the string representation of each digit in the first cube, the set remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube.
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube**
