The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num` as a parameter. Additionally, the function requires the global variables `cube_faces`, `used_cubes`, and `found` to be accessible within the function. The function iterates through the individual digits of `num` and attempts to match each digit with the cube faces in `cube_faces`. If a match is found, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a match is not found for any digit, the function returns False. If `num` is not a positive integer or `digits` is empty, the loop will not execute. If there are not enough cube faces in `cube_faces`, the function may encounter an index out of range error. If all digits are successfully matched with cube faces, the function returns True.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer num and checks if the individual digits of num can be formed using the cube faces provided in cube_faces. If all digits can be matched, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.**
