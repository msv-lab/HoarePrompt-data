According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD. The values of `l`, `r` remain unchanged, and `num + 1` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num + 1, k)`. The precondition of `l` being less than or equal to `r` is preserved. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + (num + 1)) % MOD, `l` remains the same, `r` remains the same, `num` is incremented by 1**
