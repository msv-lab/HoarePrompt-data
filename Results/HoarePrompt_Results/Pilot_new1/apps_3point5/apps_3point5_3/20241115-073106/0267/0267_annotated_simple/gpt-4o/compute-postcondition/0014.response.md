The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the program returns the total sum of numbers within the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition func_1(num, k) modulo MOD. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters l, r, and k. It returns the total sum of numbers within the range [l, r] that satisfy the func_1(num, k) condition modulo MOD.**
