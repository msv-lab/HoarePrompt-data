According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers, and `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num, k)`. The precondition of `l` being less than or equal to `r` is preserved.

To execute the loop one more time, the next `num` value should be considered. Since the loop iterates from `l` to `r`, the next `num` value should be the current `num` value plus 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers. If `func_1(num + 1, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num + 1) % MOD. The values of `l`, `r` remain unchanged, and `num + 1` satisfies the condition of `func_1(num + 1, k)`. The precondition of `l` being less than or equal to `r` is preserved.**
