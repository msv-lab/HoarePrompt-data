According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range specified by `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k` are integers. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be less than or equal to `r + 1` to ensure the loop can continue. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables. `l` is less than or equal to `r + 1`**
