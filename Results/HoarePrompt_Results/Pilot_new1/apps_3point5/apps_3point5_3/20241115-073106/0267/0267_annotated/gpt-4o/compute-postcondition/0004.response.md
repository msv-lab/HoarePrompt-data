Postcondition: ***total_sum is an integer, l is less than or equal to r, num is equal to l, and num satisfies the condition of func_1 with parameter k. If func_1(num, k) evaluates to true, total_sum is updated to the value of (total_sum + num) % MOD. The relationship between total_sum, l, num, and the condition of func_1 with parameter k is maintained after the execution of the if statement.***
