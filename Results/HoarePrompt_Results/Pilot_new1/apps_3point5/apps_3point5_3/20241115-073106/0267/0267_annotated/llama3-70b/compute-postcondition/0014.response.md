According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value based on the given formula, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp[n, k] is updated with a new value based on the given formula, i is 3**
