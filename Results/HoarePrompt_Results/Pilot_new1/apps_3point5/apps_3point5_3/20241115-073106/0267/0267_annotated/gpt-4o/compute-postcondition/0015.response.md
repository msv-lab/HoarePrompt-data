Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= 10. It iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. For each number in the range, it evaluates `func_1(num, k)`. If the evaluation is true, it updates the `total_sum` variable to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The function returns the final value of `total_sum` after iterating over the range. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute.**
