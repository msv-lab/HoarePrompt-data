The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k with specific constraints. It calculates the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. The function relies on the count function to perform the calculations. It does not provide detailed information on what the count function does or how it is implemented. The function does not handle any potential edge cases or missing functionalities specified in the annotations.
