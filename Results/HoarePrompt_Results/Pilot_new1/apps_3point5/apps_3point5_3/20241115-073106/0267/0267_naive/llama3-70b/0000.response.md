Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. The function uses a helper function `count` to calculate the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits in a given range.

The program follows the problem description accurately by correctly calculating the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits between `l` and `r`. The logic implemented in the `count` function ensures that the count of such numbers is calculated efficiently. Additionally, the modulo operation at the end ensures that the final result is within the specified bounds.

Overall, the program seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and there are no apparent issues or edge cases that are not covered by the provided code.
