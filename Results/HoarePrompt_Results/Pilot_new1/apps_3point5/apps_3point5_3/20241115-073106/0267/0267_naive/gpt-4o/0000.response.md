Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to check if a number has at most `k` different digits and calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy this condition, respectively. 
1. `func_1` checks if the number `n` has at most `k` different digits by converting it to a string and checking the length of the set of its digits. This function correctly implements the condition specified in the problem description.
2. `func_2` calculates the total sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits. It iterates through each number in the range and adds it to the total sum if it satisfies the condition. The sum is then taken modulo `998244353`. This function also correctly implements the required logic.
3. The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_2` with the input values, and prints the result. This part of the program correctly handles the input and output requirements.
Overall, the program works as expected for all potential cases and satisfies the problem description.
