Example Answer:
`total_sum` is updated to be the sum of the current `total_sum` and `num`, modulo `MOD`. The previous values of `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num + 1` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `total_sum` is updated according to the formula, `l`, `r`, and `num + 1` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the formula, `l`, `r`, and `num + 1` remain unchanged**
