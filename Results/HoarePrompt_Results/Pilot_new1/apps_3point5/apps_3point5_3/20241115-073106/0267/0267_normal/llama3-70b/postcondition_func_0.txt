The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k. It calculates the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. However, the actual implementation and behavior of the count function, as well as the definition of MOD, are not provided in the code or annotations.
