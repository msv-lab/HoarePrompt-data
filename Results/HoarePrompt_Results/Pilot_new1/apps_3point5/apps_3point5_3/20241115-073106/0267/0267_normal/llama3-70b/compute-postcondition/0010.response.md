According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, the pair (n, k) should not be present in the dictionary `dp` for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values where the pair (n, k) is not present and `dp[n, k]` is 9, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values where the pair (n, k) is not present and `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is 1**
