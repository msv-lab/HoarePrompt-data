Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of all elements in list `A`, `i` is N + 1. If i * i is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios where `max_divisor` is updated based on the condition `i * i != gcd`.***
