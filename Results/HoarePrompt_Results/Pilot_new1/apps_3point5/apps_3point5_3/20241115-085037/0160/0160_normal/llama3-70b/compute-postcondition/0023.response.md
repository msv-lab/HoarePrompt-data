Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of all elements in list `A` where `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is N + 1, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i` if `gcd % i == 0` and `i * i != gcd`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios where `max_divisor` is updated based on the condition `i * i != gcd`.***
