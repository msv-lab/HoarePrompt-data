Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `x` and returns a sorted list of all divisors of `x` in descending order. The function correctly calculates the divisors of `x` by iterating up to the square root of `x`, adding both the divisor and the quotient to a set. The function then returns the sorted list of divisors. However, it is missing explicit handling for the case where `x` is less than or equal to 1, where the loop would not execute, resulting in an empty set of divisors.**
