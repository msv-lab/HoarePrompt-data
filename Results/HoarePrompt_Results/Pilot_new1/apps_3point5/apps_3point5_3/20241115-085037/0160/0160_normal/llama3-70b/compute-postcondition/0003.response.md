According to the code, the loop will execute as long as N is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `A` is a list of N integers where the first element is used to assign `gcd`, so the loop can execute if N is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute, `K` should be assigned a non-negative integer value and `gcd` should be the first element of list `A`, `i` should start from 1.
State: **`A` is a list of N integers where 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the first element of list `A`, `i` is 1**
