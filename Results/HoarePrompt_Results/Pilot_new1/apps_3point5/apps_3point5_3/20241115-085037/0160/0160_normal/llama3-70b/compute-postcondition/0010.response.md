Output State: **`A` is a list of N integers where 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of all elements in list `A`, `i` is N if the loop executes, if N is less than 2 the loop does not execute and `gcd` remains the same as the initial value**
