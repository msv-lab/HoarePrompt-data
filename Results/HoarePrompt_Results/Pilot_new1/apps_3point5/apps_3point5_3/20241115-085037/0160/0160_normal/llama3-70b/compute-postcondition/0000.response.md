Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values from the input split by space. The values of N and K are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a list of N integers such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, K is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9.
Output State: **A is a list of N integers such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, K is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9**
