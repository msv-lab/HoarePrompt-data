Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. The previous value of `max_divisor` is unknown, so the new value depends on the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions.
Output State: **`gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions**
