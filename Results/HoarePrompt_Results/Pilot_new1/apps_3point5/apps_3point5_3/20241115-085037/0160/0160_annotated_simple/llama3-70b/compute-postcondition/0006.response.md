Example Answer:
The `gcd` variable is updated by taking the greatest common divisor of the current value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` in the list `A`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The updated `gcd` value depends on the previous value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` in list `A`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer, K is an integer, A_i are integers, A is a list of integers obtained from input(), gcd is updated based on the calculation, i is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is an integer, K is an integer, A_i are integers, A is a list of integers obtained from input(), gcd is updated based on the calculation, i is incremented by 1**
