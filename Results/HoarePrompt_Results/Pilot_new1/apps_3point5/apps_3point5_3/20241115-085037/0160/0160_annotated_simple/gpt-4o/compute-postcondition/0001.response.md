According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive). Before the loop starts, the set `divisors` is empty. To ensure the loop executes, `x` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `i` should be set to 1 to start the loop iteration.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
