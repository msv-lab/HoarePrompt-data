According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `A_i` are integers, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `gcd` is updated based on the calculation, and `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `N`, so `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **N is an integer, K is an integer, A_i are integers, A is a list of integers obtained from input(), gcd is updated based on the calculation, i is incremented by 1**
