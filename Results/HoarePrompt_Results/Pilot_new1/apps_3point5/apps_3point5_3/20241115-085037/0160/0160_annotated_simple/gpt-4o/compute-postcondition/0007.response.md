Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` initially contains all the divisors of `x`, including `i` and `x // i`. After adding `i`, the set `divisors` will now contain all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `i`. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `i`**
