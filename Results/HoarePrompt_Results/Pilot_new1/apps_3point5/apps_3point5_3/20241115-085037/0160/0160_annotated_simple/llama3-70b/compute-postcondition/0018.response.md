Postcondition: ***`gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers. If `gcd % i == 0`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i != gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
