Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. The value of `max_divisor` is adjusted based on this comparison. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions.
Output State: **`gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions**
