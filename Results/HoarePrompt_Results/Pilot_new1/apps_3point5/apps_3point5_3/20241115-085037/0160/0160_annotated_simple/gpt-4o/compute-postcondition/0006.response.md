According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` contains all the divisors of `x` including `i` and `x // i`, where `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous square root of `x`. Additionally, the set of `divisors` needs to be updated with the new divisor. 
State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i` and `x // i`, where `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is the next integer after the previous square root of `x`.**
