Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` already contained all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`, after adding `i`, the set `divisors` will now contain all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, the newly added `x // i`, and `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, the newly added `x // i`, and `i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, the newly added `x // i`, and `i`**
