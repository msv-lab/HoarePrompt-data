Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, gcd is calculated from elements in list A, i is N - 1. If gcd % (N - 1) is 0, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and N - 1. If i * i is not equal to gcd, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd divided by N - 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to max_divisor.***
