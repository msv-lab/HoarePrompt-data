According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `gcd` is assigned the value of the result of gcd operation between previous gcd value and A[i], and `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from the input split, gcd is assigned the value of the result of gcd operation between previous gcd value and A[i], i is 2**
