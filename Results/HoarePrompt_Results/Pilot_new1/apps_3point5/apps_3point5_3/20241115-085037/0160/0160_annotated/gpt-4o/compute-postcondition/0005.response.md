Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x up to x, x is greater than or equal to 1. If x % i == 0, then i is added to the divisors set along with x // i. This process covers all possible divisors of x and ensures that the divisors set contains all relevant values for x.***
