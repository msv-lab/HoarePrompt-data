The function func_2 accepts an integer x and calculates all the divisors of x. It then returns a sorted list of these divisors in descending order, including 1 and x itself if x is greater than 1. If x is 1, the function returns an empty list. The function correctly handles the case when x is 1 by returning an empty list.
