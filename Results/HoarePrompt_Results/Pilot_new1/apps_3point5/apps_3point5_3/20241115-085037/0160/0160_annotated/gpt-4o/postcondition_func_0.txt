The function func_1 accepts a list of integers lst, calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list, and returns the result. The function correctly computes the greatest common divisor for all elements in the list, ensuring N is within the specified range. However, the function lacks input validation for the edge cases where the list is empty or contains only one element.
