Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates through all the factors of the gcd and finds the maximum divisor that satisfies the condition. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
