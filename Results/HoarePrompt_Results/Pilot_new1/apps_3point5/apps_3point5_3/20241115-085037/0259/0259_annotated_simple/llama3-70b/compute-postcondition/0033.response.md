Output State: **After the loop executes, `min_time` holds the minimum time value, `ans` holds the index of the bus with the minimum time, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list. If `n` is 0 or `buses` is empty, `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, and `buses` remains an empty list. The value of `ans` is printed.**
