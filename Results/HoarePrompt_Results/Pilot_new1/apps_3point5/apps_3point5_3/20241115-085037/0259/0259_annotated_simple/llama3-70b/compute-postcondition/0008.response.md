According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 and `_` is 1. To execute one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)` with the new tuple `(s, d)` appended, `_` is 2**
