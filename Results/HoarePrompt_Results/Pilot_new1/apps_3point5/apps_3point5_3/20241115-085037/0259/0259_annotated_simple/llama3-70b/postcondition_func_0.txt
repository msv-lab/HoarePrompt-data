The function reads input for the number of buses and the time limit, then reads the starting points and destinations for each bus route. It calculates the minimum time needed to complete a bus route within the time limit and outputs the index of the bus route that can be completed in the shortest time. If there are no buses or the number of buses is 0, it prints -1.
