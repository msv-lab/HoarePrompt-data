Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules with at least 1 schedule, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list, `min_time` is updated to reflect the minimum time value encountered during the loop iterations, `ans` is -1, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. The time calculated is less than the minimum time***
