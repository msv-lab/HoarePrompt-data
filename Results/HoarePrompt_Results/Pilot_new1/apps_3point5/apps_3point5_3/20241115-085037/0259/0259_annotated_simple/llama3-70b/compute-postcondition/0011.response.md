According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 99. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples including the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 2**
