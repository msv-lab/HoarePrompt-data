According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 3 bus schedules, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules with at least 2 schedules, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list after the previous iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, the buses list must have at least 3 bus schedules, and the index `_` should be updated to the index of the last bus schedule after the next iteration. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules with at least 3 schedules, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list after the next iteration**
