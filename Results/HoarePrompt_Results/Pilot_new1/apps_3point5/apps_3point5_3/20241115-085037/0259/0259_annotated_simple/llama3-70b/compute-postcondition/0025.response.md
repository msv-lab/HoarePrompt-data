Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules with at least 2 schedules, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list, `min_time` is updated to reflect the minimum time value encountered during the loop iterations, `ans` is updated to the value of `i + 1` where `i` is the index of the current bus, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. This process covers all possible scenarios and ensures that the minimum time and corresponding bus index are correctly updated based on the conditions specified.***
