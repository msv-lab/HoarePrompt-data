Example Answer:
The code calculates the wait time for the bus to arrive based on the current time `t`, start time `s_i`, and frequency `d_i`. The wait time is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Since `s_i` is less than `t` and `((t - s_i) % d_i != 0)`, the wait time will be positive. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i and d_i are assigned from the first tuple in bus_routes, s_i is less than t, ((t - s_i) % d_i != 0), and wait_time is the calculated wait time.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i and d_i are assigned from the first tuple in bus_routes, s_i is less than t, ((t - s_i) % d_i != 0), and wait_time is the calculated wait time**
