The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. The function returns the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine the index of the bus route that minimizes the wait time for Serval at the station.
