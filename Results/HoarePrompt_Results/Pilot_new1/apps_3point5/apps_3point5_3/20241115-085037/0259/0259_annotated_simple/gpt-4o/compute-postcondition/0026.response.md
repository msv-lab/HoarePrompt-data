Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time. Initially, `min_wait_time` is set to the calculated `wait_time` based on the conditions described. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to the index of the current route. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios including edge cases where `wait_time` is equal to `min_wait_time`, ensuring the correct selection of the route with the minimum wait time.***
