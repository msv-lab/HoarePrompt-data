Output State: **After the loop executes, `min_wait_time` will hold the minimum wait time calculated for the bus routes, `chosen_route` will represent the route with the minimum wait time (index + 1), and `n` will be at least 0. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` will be updated based on the elements of `bus_routes[i]` for each iteration. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), `min_wait_time` will remain positive infinity and `chosen_route` will stay as -1. The loop handles scenarios where `s_i >= t`, `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, and all other cases to calculate the appropriate `wait_time` for each route.**
