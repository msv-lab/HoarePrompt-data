According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `_` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains the new tuple, `_` is 3**
