According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 0. However, since `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity and `chosen_route` is assigned the value -1, these values need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. 
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0**
