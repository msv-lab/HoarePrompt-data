Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` contains at least 2 tuples, `s` and `d` are integers from the second tuple in the list. After the execution of the if statement, `min_time` is updated to the minimum time calculated in the new iteration, `ans` is updated to the new value of i, `i` is incremented by 1, and `time` is the result of `(t - s) % d` for the new tuple. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is updated to i + 1.***
