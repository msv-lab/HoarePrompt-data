Output State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `min_wait_time` is updated, `chosen_route` is updated, `n` is updated, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is less than the updated `n`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.**
