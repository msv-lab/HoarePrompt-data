Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum wait time. `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, which is `i + 1` where `i` is the index. `n` is at least 0. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. The values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated accordingly based on the calculated `wait_time`.***
