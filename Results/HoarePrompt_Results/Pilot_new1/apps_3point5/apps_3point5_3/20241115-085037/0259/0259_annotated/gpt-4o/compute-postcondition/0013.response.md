Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Additionally, the `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`***
