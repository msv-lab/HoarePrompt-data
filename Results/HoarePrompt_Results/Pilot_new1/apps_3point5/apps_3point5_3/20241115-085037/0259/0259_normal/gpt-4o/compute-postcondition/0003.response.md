The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`. The values of `bus_routes[i]` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `s_i` and `d_i`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0**
