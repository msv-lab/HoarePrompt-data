Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times, each time appending a tuple (s, d) to the buses list where s and d are integers from the input. After the loop executes, buses will contain n tuples. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and buses will remain an empty list. t remains unchanged throughout the loop.**
