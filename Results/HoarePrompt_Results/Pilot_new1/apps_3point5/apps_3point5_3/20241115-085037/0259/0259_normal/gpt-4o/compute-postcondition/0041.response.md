Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates through the bus routes, calculates the wait time for each route based on the given conditions, and determines the route number with the minimum wait time. The function then returns the route number with the minimum wait time among all routes. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute. The code does not handle cases where multiple routes have the same minimum wait time.**
