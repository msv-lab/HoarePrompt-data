According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than the current value, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing a tuple `(s, d)` where a new tuple `(s, d)` has been appended. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current value + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing a tuple `(s, d)` where a new tuple `(s, d)` has been appended**
