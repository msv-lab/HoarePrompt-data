According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than the current value + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to the current value + 1, and no other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is the current value + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`**
