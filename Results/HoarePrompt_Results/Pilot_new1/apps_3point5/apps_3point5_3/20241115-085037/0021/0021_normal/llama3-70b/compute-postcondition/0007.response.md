The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates under the precondition that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive. The function does not return any value, but it performs a specific operation or task based on the values of `n` and `a` that satisfy the given constraints.
