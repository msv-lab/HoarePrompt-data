Example Answer: 
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, where `max_pos` is `n-1`. Since `max_pos` is `n-1`, the absolute difference between 0 and `n-1` is `n-1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, and `dist1` is n-1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, and `dist1` is n-1**
