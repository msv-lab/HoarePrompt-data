Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between n - 1 and `max_pos`. The value of n is the input integer, `max_pos` is n - 1, so `dist2` will be the absolute difference between n - 1 and n - 1, which is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is n-1, `dist2` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is n-1, `dist2` is 0**
