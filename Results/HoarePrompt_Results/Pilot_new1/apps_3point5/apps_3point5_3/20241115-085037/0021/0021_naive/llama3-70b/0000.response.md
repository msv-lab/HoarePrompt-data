Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, calculates the maximum and minimum distances between them, and then prints the maximum possible distance after swapping exactly one element. The logic of finding the positions and calculating the distances seems to be correct and covers all potential cases. The examples provided in the problem description also work correctly with the given program. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided examples, the program is correct.
