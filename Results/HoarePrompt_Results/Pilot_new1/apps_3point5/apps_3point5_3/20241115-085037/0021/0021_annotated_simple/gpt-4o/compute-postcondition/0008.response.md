Example Answer:
`max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. 
- `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, which is the maximum possible distance in the list `a`.
- `dist2` is 0, as it represents the distance between two arbitrary positions.
- `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, which is the minimum possible distance in the list `a`.
- `dist4` is n-1, which is the maximum possible distance in the list `a`.
Since `dist1` is the maximum value among the four, `max_distance` will be equal to `dist1`.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, `dist4` is n-1, and `max_distance` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, `dist4` is n-1, and `max_distance` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1**
