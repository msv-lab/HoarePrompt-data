Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by considering all possible positions of the minimum and maximum elements after swapping. The logic implemented in the code is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the code correctly handles the input and processes it to find the maximum distance. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and examples, the program is correct.
