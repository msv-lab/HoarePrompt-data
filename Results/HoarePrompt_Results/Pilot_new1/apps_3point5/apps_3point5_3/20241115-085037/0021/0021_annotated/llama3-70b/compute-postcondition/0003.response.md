Example Answer:
The variable `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a` using the `index()` function. If `n` is present in list `a`, `posn` will be the index of `n`. If `n` is not present in list `a`, a `ValueError` will be raised. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a**.
