Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and a list `a` of n distinct integers from input. It then calculates the maximum distance of the indices of the minimum and maximum values in the list `a` from the edges (0 and n-1) and prints this maximum distance. The function assumes that n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and a is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
