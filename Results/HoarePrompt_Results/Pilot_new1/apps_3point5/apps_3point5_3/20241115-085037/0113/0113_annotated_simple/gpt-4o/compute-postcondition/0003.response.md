The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of variable x. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the value of variable x.
