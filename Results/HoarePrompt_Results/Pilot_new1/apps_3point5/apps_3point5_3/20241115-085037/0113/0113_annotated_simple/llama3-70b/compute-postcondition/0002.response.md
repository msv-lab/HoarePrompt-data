Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, after execution, `n` becomes the previous value of `n` + 1. The value of `k` remains the same. The value of `x` is not affected by the operation. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is the result of 10 raised to the power of `k`**
