Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 8. The value of `x` will be 10 raised to the power of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `k`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `k`**
