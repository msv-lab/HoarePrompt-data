Example Answer:
The value of `n` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `n` is unknown. The value of `k` remains the same. The value of `x` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `k`, but the value of `k` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is increased by 1, `k` remains the same, `x` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is increased by 1, `k` remains the same, `x` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `k`**
