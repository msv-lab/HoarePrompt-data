Example Answer:
The list `teens` is initialized with strings representing numbers from ten to nineteen. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from ten to nineteen.
Output State: **s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from ten to nineteen**
