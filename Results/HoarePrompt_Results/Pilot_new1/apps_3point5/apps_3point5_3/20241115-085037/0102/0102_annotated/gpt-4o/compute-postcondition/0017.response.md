Postcondition: ***`ones` is a list of strings containing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings containing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings containing number names for tens from ten to ninety. n is an integer. If 0 <= n <= 9, the function returns the string representation of the number n from the `ones` list. If 11 <= n <= 19, the function returns the string representation of the number n in the `teens` list. If 10 <= n <= 99, the function returns the name of the tens place of n from the `tens` list if n is divisible by 10. Otherwise, the function concatenates the name of the tens place from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the name of the ones place from the `ones` list to represent the number n in words. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios including when n is a multiple of 10, n is between 10 and 19, and n is between 20 and 99.***
