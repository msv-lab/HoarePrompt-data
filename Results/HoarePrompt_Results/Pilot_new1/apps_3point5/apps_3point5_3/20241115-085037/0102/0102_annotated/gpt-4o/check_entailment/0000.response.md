Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program accurately follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` correctly converts an integer score between 0 and 99 into its English word representation as required. The code annotations also provide a clear explanation of how the function works and covers all possible scenarios, including numbers between 0 and 9, 11 and 19, and 20 and 99. The postconditions in the annotations confirm that the function handles all edge cases effectively. Therefore, based on the code and annotations, the program is correct.
