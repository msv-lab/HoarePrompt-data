The function accepts an integer n within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and returns the corresponding string representation of n based on predefined conditions. It handles cases where n is a single digit by returning the string representation from the list 'ones', cases where n is in the teens range by returning the string representation from the list 'teens', and cases where n is a multiple of 10 by returning the string representation of the tens place from the list 'tens'. For numbers between 10 and 99 that are not multiples of 10, it combines the string representation of the tens place with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place from the lists 'tens' and 'ones' respectively. The function covers all valid input scenarios within the specified range to ensure the correct string representation is returned for each case.
