The function `func_1` takes an integer `s` within the range 0 to 99 and returns the corresponding string representation of the number. If 0 ≤ s ≤ 9, it returns the string from the list 'ones' at index 's'. If 11 ≤ s ≤ 19, it returns the string from the list 'teens' at index (s - 10). For 10 ≤ s ≤ 99 and s not between 11 and 19, it returns the tens place string from the 'tens' list if s is divisible by 10, otherwise, it concatenates the tens place and ones place strings with a hyphen. The function accurately handles various cases within the specified ranges and provides the appropriate string representation for the input integer `s`.
