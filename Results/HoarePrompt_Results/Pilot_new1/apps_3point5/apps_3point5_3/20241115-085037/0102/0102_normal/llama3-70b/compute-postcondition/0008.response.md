Example Answer:
The code prints the string at index `s - 10` in the `teens` list. Since `s` is an integer such that 10 <= s < 20, the index will be within the range of the `teens` list. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an integer such that 10 <= s < 20, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens place values.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 10 <= s < 20, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens place values**
