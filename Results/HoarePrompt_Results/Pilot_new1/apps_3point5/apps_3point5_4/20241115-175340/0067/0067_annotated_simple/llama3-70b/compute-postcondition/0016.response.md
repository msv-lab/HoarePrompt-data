Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers. If `x` is less than `y`, the program prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, the program prints '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not 0, the program prints '?'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the program always prints '?' regardless of the values of `z`, `y`, and `x`.***
