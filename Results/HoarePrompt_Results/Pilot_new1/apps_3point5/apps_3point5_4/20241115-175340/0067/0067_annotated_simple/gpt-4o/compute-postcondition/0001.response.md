Example Answer:
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, and `x` is a non-negative integer. Since `x` can be any value between 0 and 100, the value of `min_upvotes` will also be between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100**
