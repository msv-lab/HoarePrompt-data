Example Answer: 
`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `y` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_upvotes` is the value obtained from the input string after conversion to an integer, `y` and `z` remain unchanged, `min_downvotes` is the same as `y`.
Output State: **`min_upvotes` is the value obtained from the input string after conversion to an integer, `y` and `z` remain unchanged, `min_downvotes` is the same as `y`**
