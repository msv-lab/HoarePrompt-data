Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If `x > y + z`, then the only possible result is "+". This is correctly handled in the program.
- If `x < y`, then the only possible result is "-". This is also correctly handled in the program.
- If `x == y`, then if `z == 0`, the result is "0", otherwise, it is uncertain. This logic is correctly implemented in the program.
- For all other cases, the result is uncertain, which is also correctly handled in the program. 

Therefore, the program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
