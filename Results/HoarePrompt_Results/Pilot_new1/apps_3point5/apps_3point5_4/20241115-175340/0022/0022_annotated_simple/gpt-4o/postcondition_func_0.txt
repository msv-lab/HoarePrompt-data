The function func_1 accepts a parameter `s`, a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters. It iterates through the characters of `s`, checking if the characters at symmetric positions in the string are equal. If any pair of characters at symmetric positions are not equal, it returns False. If all characters at symmetric positions are equal, it returns True. If the length of the string is less than 2, the function directly returns True.
