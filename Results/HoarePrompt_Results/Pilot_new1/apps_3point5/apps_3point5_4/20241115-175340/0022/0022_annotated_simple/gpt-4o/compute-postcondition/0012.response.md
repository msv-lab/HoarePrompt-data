Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. This loop checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string `s` are equal. If they are not, the function returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
