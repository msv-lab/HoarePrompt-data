According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n // 2 + 1`.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, containing only English letters; `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1**.
