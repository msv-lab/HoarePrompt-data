According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2`, which means `i` should be less than `(n // 2) + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, containing only English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than (n // 2) + 1**
