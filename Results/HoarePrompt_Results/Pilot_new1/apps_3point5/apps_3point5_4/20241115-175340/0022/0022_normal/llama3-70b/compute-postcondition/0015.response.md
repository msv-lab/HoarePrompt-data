Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True if all characters `s[i]` are equal to `s[n - i - 1]` for `i` between 0 and n // 2 + 1. If there exists at least one pair of characters `s[i]` and `s[n - i - 1]` that are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken.***
