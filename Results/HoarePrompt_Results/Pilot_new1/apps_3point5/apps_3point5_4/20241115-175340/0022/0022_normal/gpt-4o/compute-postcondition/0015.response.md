Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It compares symmetric positions in the string and returns False if they are not equal. If the length of the string is less than 2, it returns True by default. The function returns True if the characters at symmetric positions in the string are equal after looping through the string. **
