According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is at least 2. Since n is an integer between 1 and 1000, we need to adjust the state such that n is at least 2. Additionally, the loop will iterate n // 2 times, so we need to adjust the state such that i is between 0 and n // 2 - 1.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is between 0 and n // 2 - 1**
