Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, the program prints n. If n is not divisible by 10, the program prints n minus the remainder of n divided by 10 if the remainder is less than or equal to 5. Otherwise, the program prints n plus the difference between 10 and the remainder of n divided by 10.***
