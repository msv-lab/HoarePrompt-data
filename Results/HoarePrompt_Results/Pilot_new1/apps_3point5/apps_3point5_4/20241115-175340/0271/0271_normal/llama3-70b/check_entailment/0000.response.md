Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly rounds the input number `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n` itself. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it adjusts `n` based on the last digit: if the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` minus the last digit; if the last digit is greater than 5, it prints `n` plus the difference between 10 and the last digit. This logic aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implementing the rounding logic as described in the problem statement.
