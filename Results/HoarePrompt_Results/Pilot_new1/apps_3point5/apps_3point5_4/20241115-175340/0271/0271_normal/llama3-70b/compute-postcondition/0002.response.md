Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer divisible by 10. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `n` is divisible by 10, the possible values for `n` are 0, 10, 20, 30, ..., 10^9. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer divisible by 10.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer divisible by 10**
