According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in string `s`. Before the loop starts, the loop can execute if `s` is not empty. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is not empty, `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in string `t`, and `n` is an empty string.
State: **`s` is not empty, `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in string `t`, `n` is an empty string**
