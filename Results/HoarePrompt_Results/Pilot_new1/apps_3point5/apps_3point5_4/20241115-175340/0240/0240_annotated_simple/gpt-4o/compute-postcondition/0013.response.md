According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more permutations available in `chars`. At the end of the previous iteration, the next permutation of characters in `chars` is available, and `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters of the next permutation. If `candidate` passes the validity check with respect to `sub` using the function `is_valid_number`, then the function yields `candidate`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of characters in `chars` should be available, and the new `candidate` formed from this next permutation should be checked for validity with respect to `sub` using the function `is_valid_number`.

State: *Next permutation of characters in `chars` is available, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters of the next permutation, `candidate` passes the validity check with respect to `sub` using the function `is_valid_number`.
