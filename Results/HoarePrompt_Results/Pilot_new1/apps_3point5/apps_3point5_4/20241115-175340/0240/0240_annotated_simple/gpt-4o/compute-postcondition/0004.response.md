Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing a number, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is a string that is the result of joining `perm`. If the `candidate` is a valid number based on the `is_valid_number` function with `sub` as a parameter, then the function yields `candidate`.***
