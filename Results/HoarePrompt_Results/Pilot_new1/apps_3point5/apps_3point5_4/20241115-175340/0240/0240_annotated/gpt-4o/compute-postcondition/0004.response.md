Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the first permutation of the string represented by `chars`. If `candidate` passes the validity check with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
