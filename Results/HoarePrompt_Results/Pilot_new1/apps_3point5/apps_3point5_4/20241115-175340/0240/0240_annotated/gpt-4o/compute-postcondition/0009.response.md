According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are permutations of the `chars` string. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number with `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation `perm` should be generated, and `candidate` should be checked to see if it is a valid number with `sub`.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`.**
