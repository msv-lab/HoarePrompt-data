Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, so `n` will have the new concatenated string. The previous value of `n` is unknown, but `c` is a character. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`**
