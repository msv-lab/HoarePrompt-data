Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the `candidate` string, which represents the next permutation of `chars`. Since the initial state mentions that `chars` is a non-empty list with more permutations left, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string representing the next permutation of `chars`, the output state would be:
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty list with more permutations left, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of `chars`**
