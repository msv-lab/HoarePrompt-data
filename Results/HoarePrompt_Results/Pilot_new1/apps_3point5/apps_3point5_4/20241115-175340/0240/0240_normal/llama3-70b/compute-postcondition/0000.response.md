Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is created by converting the string `t` into a set. The previous values of `s` and `t` are unknown and not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`.
Output State: **`s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`**
