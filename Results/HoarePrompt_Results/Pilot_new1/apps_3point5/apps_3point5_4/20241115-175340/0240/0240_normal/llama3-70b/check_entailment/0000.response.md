Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in two string parameters `s` and `t`.
- It iterates through each character in `s` and if the character is present in the set `t`, it appends that character to the string `n`.
- After the loop, it concatenates string `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of the resulting string `n`.
- The code correctly handles the case where `s` is empty or no characters in `s` are in `t`.
- The function does not handle cases where the input strings contain non-numeric characters or special characters, but this is not a requirement based on the problem description.
- The code meets the requirements of the problem description and correctly finds the smallest possible initial integer `n` that Vasya could pass to Kate.
