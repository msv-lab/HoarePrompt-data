Postcondition: ***The `colors` list is not empty. The `found` variable is set to True, `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color in the `colors` list, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the count of colors that were not previously in `window_counts`. The variable `i` is less than `n+1`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if statement, all values in `window_counts` have been sorted and are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If a color was not in `window_counts`, a key-value pair was added with the color and value 0. Additionally, all values in `window_counts` have been set to 0, `found` is True, and the loop is broken.***
