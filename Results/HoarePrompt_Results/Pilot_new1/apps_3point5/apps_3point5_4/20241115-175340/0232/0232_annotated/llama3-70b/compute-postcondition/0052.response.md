Postcondition: ***If the `colors` list is not empty and the loop does execute, `found` is True. `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color in the `colors` list. `window_counts` is a dictionary with the count of colors that were not previously in `window_counts`. `i` is less than or equal to `n`. `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list. `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the color assigned to `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, a key-value pair is added to `window_counts` where the key is the color and the value is 0. All the values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If the `colors` list is empty, the loop does not execute.***
