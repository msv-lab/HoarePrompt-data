Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to their respective values in list k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict object with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if statement, if all values in `current_counts` for colors match their corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES'. If there exists at least one color where the value in `current_counts` is less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts` for that color, the program does not return 'YES'. This condition covers all edge cases, ensuring that the program correctly handles the scenario where the counts for all colors match the desired counts as well as when there is a mismatch for at least one color.***
