Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, if the colors list is not empty, the loop will iterate through the colors list until all color counts in window_counts match the corresponding counts in color_counts. If this condition is met, the variable found will be set to True, and the loop will break. The state after the loop executes will be as follows: colors list is not empty, found is either True or False, color_counts contains the count of each color in the colors list, window_counts contains the count of colors that were not previously in window_counts, i is less than or equal to n, color is assigned the value at index j in the colors list, window_counts[color] is incremented based on color occurrences, and all values in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in counts.***
