The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It updates `current_counts` based on `colors` and `desired_counts` as long as certain conditions are met during the loop execution. If all colors in `desired_counts` are present in `colors` and have the desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. If a color in `desired_counts` is not present in `colors`, the loop does not execute, and the function returns 'NO'.
