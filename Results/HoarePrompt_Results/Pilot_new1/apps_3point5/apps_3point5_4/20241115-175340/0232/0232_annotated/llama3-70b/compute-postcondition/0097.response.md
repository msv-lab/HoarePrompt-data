Postcondition: ***colors list is not empty, found is either True or False, color_counts contains the count of each color in the colors list, window_counts is a dictionary with the count of color occurrences where the count of color assigned to color is incremented by 1, i is less than or equal to n, color is assigned the value at index j in the colors list, all values in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in counts. If color is not in window_counts, then window_counts[color] is set to 0. If all values in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in counts, found is set to True and the loop breaks.***
