Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `found` will be True. `i` will remain 0, `n` will still be greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` will be a dictionary with updated counts for colors encountered, `j` will be the last value of the range, `color` will retain the value of `colors[j]`, and `color` will be present in `window_counts` if it satisfies the condition.***
