According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `found` is False before the loop starts, it does not directly affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
