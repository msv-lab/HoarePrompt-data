Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` is not already in `color_counts`, then it is updated with `color` as a key and the value set to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list with at least 2 colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated counts for the specified color.
Output State: **`colors` is a list with at least 2 colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated counts for the specified color**
