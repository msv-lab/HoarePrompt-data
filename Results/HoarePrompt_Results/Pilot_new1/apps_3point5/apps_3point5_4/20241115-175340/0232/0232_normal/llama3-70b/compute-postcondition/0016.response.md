Example Answer:
The value of color_counts[color] is incremented by 1. The previous value of color_counts[color] is not specified, so the output state is: colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 3 integers. If color is not already in color_counts, then color_counts[color] is set to 1. In all other cases, the state of color_counts remains unchanged.
Output State: **colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 3 integers. If color is not already in color_counts, then color_counts[color] is set to 1. In all other cases, the state of color_counts remains unchanged.**
