Example Answer:
The count of the color at index j (i+2) in the list `colors` is incremented by 1 in `window_counts`. If the color was not already present in `window_counts`, it is initialized to 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 integer, color is the color at index j in the list where j is equal to i+2, color_counts and window_counts are updated accordingly, and window_counts[color] is incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if it was not present.
Output State: **colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 integer, color is the color at index j in the list where j is equal to i+2, color_counts and window_counts are updated accordingly, and window_counts[color] is incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if it was not present**
