According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i+1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than `i+2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 integer. color is the color at index i+2 in the list. color_counts has color assigned the value 1 if not present. window_counts is a dictionary where color is assigned the value 1 if not present, j is i+2. n is greater than i+2. found is True.**
