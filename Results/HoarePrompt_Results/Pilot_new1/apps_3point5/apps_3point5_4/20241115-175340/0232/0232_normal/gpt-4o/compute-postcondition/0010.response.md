Postcondition: ***`current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values where the count of `colors[right]` is increased by 1 and counts for other colors are adjusted to match the desired counts. `left` is 0, `right` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. If all the counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts for each color in `desired_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there are discrepancies in the counts of colors between `current_counts` and `desired_counts`.***
