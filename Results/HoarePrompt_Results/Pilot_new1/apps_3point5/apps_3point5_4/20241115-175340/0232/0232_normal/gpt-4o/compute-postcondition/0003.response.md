According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `right` is within the range of `n`. Before the loop starts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `right` is 0, and `left` is 0.
State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
