Example Answer:
The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. The value of `n` is a positive integer, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters**
