Postcondition: ***Output State: If votes is an empty string, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, r_queue contains the indices of the characters in votes that are not 'D', and d_queue contains the indices of the characters in votes that are 'D'. i is equal to the total number of characters processed, v is the next character in the votes string, and d_index is the index popped from d_queue. r_index is assigned the value popped from the front of r_queue. If d_index < r_index, then d_queue appends the value d_index + n. If d_index is not less than r_index, then r_queue appends the value r_index + n. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and ensures the correct state of the program variables after the if else block executes. `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`. `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. If d_index < r_index, then d_queue appends the value d_index + n. If d_index is not less than r_index, then r_queue appends the value r_index + n.***
