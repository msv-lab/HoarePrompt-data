Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the number of employees and their fractions, counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R', and then determines the outcome of the vote based on which fraction has more representatives. The annotations also provide a good summary of what the code is doing, confirming that it follows the problem description for all potential cases. The examples provided in the problem description also align with the expected output of the code. Thus, the code is correct.
