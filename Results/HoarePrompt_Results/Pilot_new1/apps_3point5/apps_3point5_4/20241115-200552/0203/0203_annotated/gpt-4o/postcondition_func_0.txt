The function reads an integer n representing the number of employees and a string of votes where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats. It then simulates the voting process where employees vote in a queue based on their party affiliation. The function determines the majority party among the employees and prints 'D' if there are more depublicans, 'R' if there are more remocrats, and 'Tie' if the number of depublicans and remocrats is equal.
