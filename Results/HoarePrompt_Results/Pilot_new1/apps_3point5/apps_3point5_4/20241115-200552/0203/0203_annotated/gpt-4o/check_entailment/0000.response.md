Correctness: **True**

The code follows the problem description accurately. It correctly simulates the voting process where employees from different factions take turns to deny others the right to vote until there is only one employee left who determines the outcome of the vote based on their faction. The code correctly handles the scenario where employees are denied the right to vote, updates the queues accordingly, and determines the majority party at the end. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the program flow and the state of variables at different stages, which align with the problem description. Additionally, the provided examples match the expected output based on the described voting process. Therefore, the code is correct in all potential cases.
