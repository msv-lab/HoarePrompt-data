Example Answer:
`depublicans` is increased by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, so after execution, `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The value of `remocrats` does not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters, `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters, `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains the same**
