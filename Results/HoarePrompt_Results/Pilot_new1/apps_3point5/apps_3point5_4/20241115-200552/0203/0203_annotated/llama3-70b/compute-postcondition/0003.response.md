Example Answer:
`remocrats` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
