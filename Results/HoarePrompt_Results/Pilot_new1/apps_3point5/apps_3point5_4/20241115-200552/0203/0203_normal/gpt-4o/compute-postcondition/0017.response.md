Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length greater than the current index in the loop. If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is updated with the appended value of `i`, and `r_queue` remains unchanged. If `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` is updated with the appended value of `i`, and `d_queue` remains unchanged. In either case, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated accordingly based on the condition.***
