Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `r_queue` list. Since the initial state of `r_queue` is not provided, we can only say that `i` is added to the `r_queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length greater than the current index in the loop, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated accordingly, and `i` is appended to the `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length greater than the current index in the loop, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated accordingly, and `i` is appended to the `r_queue`**
