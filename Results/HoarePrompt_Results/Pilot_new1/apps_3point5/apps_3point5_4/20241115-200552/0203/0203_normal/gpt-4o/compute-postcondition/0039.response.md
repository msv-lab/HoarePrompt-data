According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
State: **After the if-else block executes, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. If the loop executes, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes` and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters in `votes'. If the loop does not execute, `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`. `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. Now, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. In the if part, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`. In the else part, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n.`
To execute the loop one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to be non-empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
