According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the fractions list. If the list still has at least 1 fraction, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer representing the number of employees, fractions list still has at least 1 fraction. If the last fraction processed was 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `remocrats` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the fractions list must still have at least 1 fraction.
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of employees, fractions list still has at least 1 fraction, `depublicans` and `remocrats` may have been updated based on the last processed fraction**
