Postcondition: ***The loop updates the `prefix_balances` list based on the calculation `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` for each index `i` in the range of 1 to n inclusive, where `n` is the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the `prefix_balances` list remains initialized with 0s. Additionally, when the `balance` is 0, the loop executes as described above. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` list appends -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` list appends 0. If prefix_balances list has at least 1 element, balance is not equal to 0, x and b are integers, and (x - b) is divisible by balance and the result is non-negative, then count is increased by 1 for each element in the prefix_balances list. If prefix_balances list is empty or balance is 0, the loop does not execute and count remains 0. The results list now contains the value of count.***
