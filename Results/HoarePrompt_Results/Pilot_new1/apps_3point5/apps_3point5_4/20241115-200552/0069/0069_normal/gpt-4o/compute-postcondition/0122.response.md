According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `results`. If there are more values in the `results` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the program prints the value stored in the variable `result`. To execute the loop one more time, the `results` list must have at least one more value to iterate over. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The program prints the value stored in the variable `result`.**
