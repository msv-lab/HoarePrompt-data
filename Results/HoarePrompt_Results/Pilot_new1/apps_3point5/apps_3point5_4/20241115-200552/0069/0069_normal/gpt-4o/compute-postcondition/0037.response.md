Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer initially 0. It is incremented by 1 if both conditions are satisfied: `prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element, `x` is an integer, and `balance` is a non-zero integer. The conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 hold true. `prefix_balances` has at least 3 elements. The postcondition covers all edge cases where the count is updated based on the specified conditions.***
