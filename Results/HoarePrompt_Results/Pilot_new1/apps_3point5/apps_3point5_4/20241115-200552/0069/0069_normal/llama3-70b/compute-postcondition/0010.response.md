Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, `balance` is the result of subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's in the input string `s`. The balance is not equal to `x`. The difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`**
