Output State: **If prefix_balances list has at least 1 element, balance is not equal to 0, x and b are integers, and (x - b) is divisible by balance and the result is non-negative, then count is increased by 1 for each element in the prefix_balances list. If prefix_balances list is empty or balance is 0, the loop does not execute and count remains 0. The results list now contains the value of count.**
