According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `prefix_balances` list has at least 1 element. In this case, we know that `prefix_balances` list has at least 3 elements. Therefore, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`count` is 0, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` of the data list, `prefix_balances` list has at least 3 elements, `n` is assigned the integer value at index `index` of the data list, `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the data list, `index` is increased by 3**.
