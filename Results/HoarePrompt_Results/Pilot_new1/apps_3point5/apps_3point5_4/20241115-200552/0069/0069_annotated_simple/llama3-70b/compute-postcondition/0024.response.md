Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string from user input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If balance equals x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)***
