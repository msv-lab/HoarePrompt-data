Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values are converted to integers using `int()`. The previous state of the variables is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
