Example Answer:
A list `prefix_balances` is created with a length of `n + 1` filled with zeros. The variables `n`, `x`, `s`, `index`, and `balance` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1') and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1') and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros**
