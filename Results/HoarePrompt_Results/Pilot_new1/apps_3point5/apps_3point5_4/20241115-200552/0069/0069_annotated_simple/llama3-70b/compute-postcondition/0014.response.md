Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, s is a string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If the balance is equal to x, then the program prints n + 1. If the balance is not equal to x and ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1), ensuring all edge cases and conditions are met.***
