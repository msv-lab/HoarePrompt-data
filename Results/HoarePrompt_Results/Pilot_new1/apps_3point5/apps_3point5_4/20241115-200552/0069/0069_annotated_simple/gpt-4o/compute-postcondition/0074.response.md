Postcondition: ***If balance is not equal to 0, then `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length greater than 2, `count` is increased by 3. If balance is equal to 0, then `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding character in string s is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index i with more elements left in the list, `count` is increased by 3. In either case, if (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, `count` is further increased by 1.***
