Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string.
2. It calculates the balance of the string based on the counts of '0' and '1'.
3. It then checks three conditions as per the problem description:
   - If the balance is equal to the desired balance, it prints the length of the string + 1.
   - If the difference between the desired balance and the current balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of '0' and '1', it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and prints the number of prefixes required to achieve the desired balance.
4. The program handles cases where division by zero could occur by checking for such scenarios before performing calculations.
5. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for the given examples.
6. Since no potential case has been identified where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
