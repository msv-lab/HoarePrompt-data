Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, length of string $s$, desired balance $x$, and the binary string $s$ for each test case.
2. It calculates the balance of the string $s$ correctly as the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's.
3. It then calculates the prefix balances for each prefix of $t$ and stores them in a list.
4. The program correctly handles the case where the balance is 0 and checks if the desired balance $x$ is present in the prefix balances list, returning -1 if it is present and 0 if it is not.
5. For non-zero balance, the program correctly counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance $x$ by iterating through the prefix balances list and checking if the condition $(x - b) \% balance == 0$ and $(x - b) // balance >= 0$ is satisfied.
6. The program then outputs the results for each test case.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description and handles the cases as expected.
