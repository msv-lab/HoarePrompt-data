Postcondition: ***If balance is not equal to 0, then `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, `count` is 0. If balance is equal to 0, then `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding character in string s is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index i, `count` is 0. Additionally, x is an integer, b is an integer, and x - b is divisible by balance with a non-negative quotient.***
