Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string from user input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n`, `x` are assigned values from user input after splitting, `cnt0` is assigned the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is assigned the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If the expression (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This covers all cases where the program executes based on the condition and the resulting output.***
