Output State: 
- If T is greater than 0, the loop will execute T times. 
- For each iteration, n and x are assigned values from user input after splitting, s is assigned a string from user input, cnt0 is assigned the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is assigned the count of '1' in s, and balance is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. 
- If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. 
- If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, the program prints -1. 
- Otherwise, the program prints the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1. 
- If T is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and the variables remain uninitialized.
- The loop handles cases where the input values lead to a division by zero error, ensuring a comprehensive output state.
