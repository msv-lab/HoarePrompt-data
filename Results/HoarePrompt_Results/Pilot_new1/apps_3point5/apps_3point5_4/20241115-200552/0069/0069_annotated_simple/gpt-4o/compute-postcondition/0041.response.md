Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, index is 4, results is a list that contains either -1 or 0 based on whether x is in prefix_balances or not when balance is 0. If balance is not 0, count is the total number of times the conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 are satisfied throughout the loop iterations. The loop executes if n is greater than 0, otherwise, it does not execute. n is greater than 0, x contains the integer value at index 2 of data, s contains the value at index 3 of data, balance is the result of counting '0's minus counting '1's in string s, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1 where prefix_balances[i] is calculated as prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) for each index i, prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the provided formula, i is within the range of 1 to n inclusive, and x is either in or not in prefix_balances based on the if else condition.***
