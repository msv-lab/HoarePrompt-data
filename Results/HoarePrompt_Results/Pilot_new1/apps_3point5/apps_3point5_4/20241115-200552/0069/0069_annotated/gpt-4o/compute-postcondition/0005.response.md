According to the code, the loop will execute `T` times, so `T` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `index` is 1 and `results` is an empty list. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to `T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 0, and `results` is an empty list.
State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
