Postcondition: ***prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of the values determined by the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) for each index i from 0 to n. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute and prefix_balances remains initialized as a list of zeros with length n + 1. Additionally, x is in prefix_balances***
