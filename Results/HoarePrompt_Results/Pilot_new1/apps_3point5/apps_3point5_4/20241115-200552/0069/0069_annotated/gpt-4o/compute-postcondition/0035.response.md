According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `prefix_balances` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of length 2 filled with 0s. To execute the loop one more time, the loop needs to move to the next element in the `prefix_balances` list. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the index of the current element being accessed in the list.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length 2 filled with 0s, moving to the next element in the list**
