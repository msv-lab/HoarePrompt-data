According to the code, the loop can execute if `prefix_balances` has at least one element. Since `prefix_balances` is currently a list of length 1 filled with 0s, the loop can execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `prefix_balances` is a list of length 1 filled with 0s.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length 1 filled with 0s**
