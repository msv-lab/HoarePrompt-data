According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables T and _. If _ is less than T, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is a positive integer, _ is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of _ needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **T is a positive integer, _ is 2, n and x are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, cnt0 and cnt1 are calculated based on the input string s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed.**
