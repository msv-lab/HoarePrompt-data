Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, _ is 0, n and x are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. The balance is not equal to x. The difference between x and balance is divisible by the difference between cnt0 and cnt1***
