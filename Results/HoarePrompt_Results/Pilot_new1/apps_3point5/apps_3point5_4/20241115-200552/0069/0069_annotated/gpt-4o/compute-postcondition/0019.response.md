Output State: **The loop calculates the prefix sums of the balance values in the string `s` and stores them in the list `prefix_balances`. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with 0s.**
