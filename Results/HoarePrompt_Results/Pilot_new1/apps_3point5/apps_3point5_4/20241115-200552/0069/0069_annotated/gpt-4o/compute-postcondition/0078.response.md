Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, s is assigned the value extracted from data[index + 2], prefix_balances is a list of integers with length n + 1, n is the integer value extracted from data[index], balance is the result of counting '0's and '1's in s, results contains the appended count, x is an integer extracted from data[index + 1], index is increased by 3. If balance is equal to 0, the results list will have -1 appended if x is in prefix_balances, otherwise 0 will be appended. If balance is not equal to 0, count will contain the total number of elements in prefix_balances that satisfy the conditions, and results will have the appended value of count. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program after the if-else block executes.***
