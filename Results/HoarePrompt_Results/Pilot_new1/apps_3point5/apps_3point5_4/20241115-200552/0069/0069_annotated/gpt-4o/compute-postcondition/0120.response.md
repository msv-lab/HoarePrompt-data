According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` list has at least one element. Since the loop has already executed at least once, for it to execute one more time, the `results` list must still have at least two elements.
State: **`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` list has at least two elements**
