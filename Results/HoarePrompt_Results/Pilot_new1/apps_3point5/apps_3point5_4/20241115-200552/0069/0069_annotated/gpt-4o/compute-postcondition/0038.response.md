According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `prefix_balances` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of length 2 filled with 0s and moving to the next element in the list. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the list needs to be accessed.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length 2 filled with 0s, moving to the next element in the list**
