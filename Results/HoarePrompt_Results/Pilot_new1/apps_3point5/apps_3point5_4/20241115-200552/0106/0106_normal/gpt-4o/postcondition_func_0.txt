The function `func_1` accepts five positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, calculates the total time based on the given constraints, and returns the sum of time to exit, minimum walk time, and time to the target floor. It determines the time taken to move from location `a` to location `b` within a building with multiple blocks and floors. The function considers different scenarios such as the floor of location `a`, the direct and reverse walk times between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor.
