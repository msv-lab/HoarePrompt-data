Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the apartment numbers `a` and `b` are in the same block but on different floors. In such a scenario, the code does not account for the time it takes to move between floors within the same block. The `func_1` function only considers the time to exit, minimum walk time between blocks, and time to reach the target floor, but it does not include the time taken to move between floors within the same block. This means that the code does not fully adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.
