- It then calculates the floor and block values for both Edward's and Natasha's apartments.
- After the calculations, it correctly determines the minimum time required to move between blocks and floors.
- The code follows the problem description accurately by considering the time taken for Edward to move between blocks, floors, and waiting for the lift.
- The logic in the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that Edward can reach Natasha's apartment in the minimum time possible.
