Example Answer:
If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is set to 0. If `floor_a` is not equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. Finally, `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **Based on the calculations of `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time`**.
