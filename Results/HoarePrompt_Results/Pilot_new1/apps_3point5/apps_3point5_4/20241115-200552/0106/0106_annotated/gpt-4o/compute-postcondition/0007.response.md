Output State: **`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are all variables representing the locations of blocks and floors. If the floor number where `a` is located is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, if the floor number where `a` is located is not 1, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15.**
