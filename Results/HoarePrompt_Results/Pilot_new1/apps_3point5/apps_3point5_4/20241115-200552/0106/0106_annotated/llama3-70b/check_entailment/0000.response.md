Correctness: True

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for the number of blocks, floors, apartments per floor, as well as the apartments of Edward and Natasha.
- It calculates the floor and block numbers for both Edward and Natasha's apartments.
- It then calculates the minimum time required to move between blocks and floors based on the given conditions.
- The code handles scenarios where Edward's floor is greater than Natasha's floor and vice versa, ensuring the correct time calculations.
- The final output is the sum of the minimum block time and minimum floor time, which aligns with the problem description.

Overall, the code covers all the requirements specified in the problem description and the annotations provide additional clarity on the logic implemented in the code.
