Example Answer:
`floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The value of `apartment` can vary, as well as `m` and `k`. After the calculation, `floor_within_block` will hold a specific value based on the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.
Output State: **`floor_within_block` holds a specific value based on the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k**`.
