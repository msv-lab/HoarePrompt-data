Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split into integers.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split into integers**
