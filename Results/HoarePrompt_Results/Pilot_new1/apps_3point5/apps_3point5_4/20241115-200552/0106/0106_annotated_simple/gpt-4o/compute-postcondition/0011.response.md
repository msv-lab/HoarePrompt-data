Output State: **`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, `n`, `time_to_exit` remain unchanged or calculated values, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` are calculated based on the initial state values, `total_time` is assigned the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`**
