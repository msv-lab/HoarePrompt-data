Example Answer:
`b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided, where `b`, `m`, and `k` are involved. The previous values of `b`, `m`, and `k` are known, so `b_block` is calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split into integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the unknown values of `a` and `m`, `a_block` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split into integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the unknown values of `a` and `m`, `a_block` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
