Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input for the number of blocks, floors per block, and apartments per floor. It then calculates the location of Edward's and Natasha's apartments based on the block and floor. The program correctly calculates the time for Edward to exit his apartment, the time required for walking between blocks, and the time to reach Natasha's floor. It then returns the total time taken for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that the output is correct.
