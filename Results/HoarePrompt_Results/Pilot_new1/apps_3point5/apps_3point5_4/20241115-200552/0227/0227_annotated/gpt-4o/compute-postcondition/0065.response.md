Postcondition: ***If `assigned` has at least 2 elements and `x` is not the last element in the `assigned` list, and `a[i]` is different from `x`, and `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if `assigned` has only 1 element or `x` is the last element in the `assigned` list, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains True. After the if else block executes, `can_form` remains True and there are no changes in the state of the program.***
