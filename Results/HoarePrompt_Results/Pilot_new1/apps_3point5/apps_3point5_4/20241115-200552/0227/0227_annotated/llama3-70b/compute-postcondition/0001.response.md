Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The input is split using the `split()` function and then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the input is not specified, the exact values of the list `a` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers**
