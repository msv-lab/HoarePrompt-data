According to the code, the loop can execute if `assigned` has at least 1 element and `x` is present in the `assigned` list. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `x` is not in the `assigned` list, the loop will not execute. After the if statement, if `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `assigned` has at least 1 element and `x` is present in the `assigned` list, the loop will execute again. So `assigned` should have at least 1 element and `x` should be present in the list.
2. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. So `a[i] - x` should not be in the `assigned` list to continue the loop.
3. If `x` is not in the `assigned` list, the loop will not execute. So `x` should not be in the `assigned` list to continue the loop.
4. After the if statement, if `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1. So `can_form` should be False to increase `m`.

State: **If `assigned` has at least 1 element and `x` is present in the `assigned` list, `a[i] - x` is not in the `assigned` list, `x` is not in the `assigned` list, and `can_form` is False, then the loop will execute one more time.**
