Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by converting the input string to integers using the `map` and `split` functions. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input**
