Output State: **`can_form` is a boolean indicating whether a pair of elements in the `assigned` list exists such that their difference is equal to the element at index `i` of list `a`. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1. In the case where no such pair exists, `can_form` remains False and `m` is incremented by 1. `i` represents the index of the last element checked in the loop, `assigned` list contains at least 1 element, and `a[i]` has been added to the `assigned` list.**
