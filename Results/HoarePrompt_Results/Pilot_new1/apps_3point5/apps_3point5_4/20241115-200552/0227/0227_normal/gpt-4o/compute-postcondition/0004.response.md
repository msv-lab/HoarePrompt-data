According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. The loop will start from 1 and go up to `n-1`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers in ascending order, and `assigned` is a set containing the first element of list `a`.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` is a set containing the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1**
