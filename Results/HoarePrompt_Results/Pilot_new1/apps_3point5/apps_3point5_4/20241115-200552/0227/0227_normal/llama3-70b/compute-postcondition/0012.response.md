Example Answer:
`m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is unknown, so the new value of `m` is `m + 1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input sorted in ascending order, `m` is `m + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input sorted in ascending order, `m` is `m + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**
