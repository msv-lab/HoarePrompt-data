Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` is a set containing more elements for iteration, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of list `a`. If there exists an element in list `a` such that the difference between that element and `x` is in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the initial conditions are maintained.***
