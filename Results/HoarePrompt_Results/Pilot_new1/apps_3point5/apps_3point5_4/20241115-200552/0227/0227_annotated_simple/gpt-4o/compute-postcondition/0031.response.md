Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean value. If there exists an element `a[i]` in the list `a` such that `a[i] - x` is in the list `assigned`, then `can_form` is True, `m` is 1, `assigned` is a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `assigned`. If the condition is not met, then `can_form` remains False, `m` is 1, `assigned` is a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `assigned`.***
