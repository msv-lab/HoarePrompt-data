The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. The function executes a loop and returns the final value of the variable `m` after the loop execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, then return the final value of variable `m` after the loop execution.
