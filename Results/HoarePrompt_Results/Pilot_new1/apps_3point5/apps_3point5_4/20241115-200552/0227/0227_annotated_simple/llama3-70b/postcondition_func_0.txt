The function reads an integer n from input, then reads n space-separated integers into a list. It sorts the list and iterates through it to count the number of elements that are not double the value of the previous element. The final count is printed if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise -1 is printed. The function calculates and prints the count of non-double elements in the sorted list.
