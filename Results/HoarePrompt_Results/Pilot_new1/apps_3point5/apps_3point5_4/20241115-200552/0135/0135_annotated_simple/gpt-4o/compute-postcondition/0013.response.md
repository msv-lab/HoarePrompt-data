According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `k`, `i` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` ≥ 1. `i` is 4, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is the result of `n % 3**
