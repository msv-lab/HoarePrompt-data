The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case_1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `n` and `k`.

Case_2: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute and the output will be 'No'. If the loop does execute, `n`, `k`, `i` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` ≥ 1. `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` ranges from 1 to `k`, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'.

Case_3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions described above, return either 'No' or 'Yes'.
