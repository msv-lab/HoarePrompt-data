According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` starts at 1. Additionally, since `seen_remainders` is an empty set before the loop, it remains unchanged.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
