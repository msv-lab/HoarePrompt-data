According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of n % i, `remainder` is the result of n % 3, `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`**
