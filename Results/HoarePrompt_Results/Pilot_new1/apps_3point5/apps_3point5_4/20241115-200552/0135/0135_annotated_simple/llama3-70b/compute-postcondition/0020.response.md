Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of n % 3, `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`. If the value of `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables.**
