Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. If k is less than n, it checks for unique remainders of n divided by i for i ranging from 1 to k. If a repeated remainder is found, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute. **
