Correctness: True

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers `n` and `k` as input, then iterates over numbers from 1 to `k`, checking for repeated remainders when dividing `n` by these numbers. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits the loop. If no repeated remainders are found, it prints 'Yes'. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the logic within the code, and upon reviewing the code and annotations, there doesn't seem to be any case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
