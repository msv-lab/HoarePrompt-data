According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, since `remainder` is the result of `n % i` and is added to `seen`, the new `seen` value should include the current `remainder` value. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n`, `k`, `seen` includes the current `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`**
