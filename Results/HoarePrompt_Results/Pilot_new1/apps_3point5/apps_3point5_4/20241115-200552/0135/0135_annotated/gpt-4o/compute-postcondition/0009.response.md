According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 1**
