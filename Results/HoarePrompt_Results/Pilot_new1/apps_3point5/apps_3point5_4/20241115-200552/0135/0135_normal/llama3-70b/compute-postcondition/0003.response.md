Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is divided by the value of `i`, which is 1. The remainder is then stored in the variable `remainder`. Since `i` is 1, the remainder will always be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
