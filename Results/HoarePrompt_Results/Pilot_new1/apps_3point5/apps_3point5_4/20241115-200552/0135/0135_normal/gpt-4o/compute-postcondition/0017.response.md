Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and n > k. 
Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables n and k.
Case_2: The function iterates through the range from 1 to k, checking the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. If no repeated remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine if there are any repeated remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k, and return 'No' if there are, otherwise return 'Yes'.**
