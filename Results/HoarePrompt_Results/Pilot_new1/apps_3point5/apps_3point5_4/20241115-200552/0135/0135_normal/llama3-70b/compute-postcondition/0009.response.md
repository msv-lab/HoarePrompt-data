According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 0**
