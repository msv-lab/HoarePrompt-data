Postcondition: ***`n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 3. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, the program continues as is.***
