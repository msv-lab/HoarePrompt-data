Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting it. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting it.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting it**
