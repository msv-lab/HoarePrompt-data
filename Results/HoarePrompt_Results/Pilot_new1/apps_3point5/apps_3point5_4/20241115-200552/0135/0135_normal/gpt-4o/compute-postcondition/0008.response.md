Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and n > k. `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i. If the `remainder` is already in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
