According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and n > k, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to k, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than k. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to 3.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and n > k, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i**
