Output State: **The loop iterates through the list of cubes and adds the digits of each cube to the set `digits`. If `cubes` is empty, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. After the loop executes, `digits` contains all unique digits from 0 to 9 present in the cubes. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. The set `digits` then contains all unique digits from 1 to 9 present in the cubes, ensuring that '0' is not included. Finally, `max_num` is assigned the integer value of the sorted `digits` set in descending order and converted to a single integer. The value of `max_num` is printed.**
