Postcondition: ***n is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, each integer in cube_faces is between 0 and 9 (inclusive); used_cubes is a list of n booleans with at least one element set to True; found is True. After the execution of the if block, one of the cubes (indexed by i) that has not been used yet, contains the digit in its faces, and the corresponding element in used_cubes is set to True. The variable found remains True.***
