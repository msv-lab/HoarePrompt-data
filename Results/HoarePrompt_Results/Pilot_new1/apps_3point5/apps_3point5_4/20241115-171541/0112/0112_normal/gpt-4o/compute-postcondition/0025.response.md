According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more digits in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if n is at least 1, used_cubes will have at least one element set to True, found will be True if a cube with the digit is found, otherwise False. If n is 0, no changes occur in the variables. After the execution of the if statement, if found is False, the program returns False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If n is at least 1, used_cubes will have at least one element set to True.
- If found is False after the execution of the if statement, the program will return False.

State: **If n is at least 1, used_cubes will have at least one element set to True, found will be True if a cube with the digit is found, otherwise False. If n is 0, no changes occur in the variables. After the execution of the if statement, if found is False, the program returns False.**
