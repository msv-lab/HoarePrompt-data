Postcondition: ***The loop iterates through the list of cubes and adds the digits of each cube to the set `digits`. If `cubes` is empty, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. After the loop executes, `digits` contains all unique digits from 0 to 9 present in the cubes. '0' is present in the set `digits`.***
