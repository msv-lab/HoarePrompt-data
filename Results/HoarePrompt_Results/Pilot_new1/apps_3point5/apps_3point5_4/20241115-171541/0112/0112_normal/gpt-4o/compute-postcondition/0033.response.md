Functionality: ** The function `can_form_number` accepts an integer `num` and a list of cube faces. It iterates through the digits of `num` and checks if there is a cube with a face containing that digit. If a cube is found for each digit, it returns True. If a cube with a digit is not found or if there are duplicate digits in the cube_faces lists, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where n is less than 1 or greater than 3, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. **
