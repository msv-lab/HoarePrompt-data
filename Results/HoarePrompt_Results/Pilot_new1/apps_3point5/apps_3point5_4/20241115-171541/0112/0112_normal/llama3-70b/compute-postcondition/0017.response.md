Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, then reads `n` lists of integers representing cubes. It extracts all unique digits from these cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and concatenates them to form the maximum possible number. Finally, it prints this maximum number.**
