According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of cubes in the list `cubes`. If there are more cubes left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits from 0 to 9. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the number of cubes in the list `cubes` must be more than the current number of cubes. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the number of cubes in the list `cubes`. Since `n` is the number of cubes in the list, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 4, `cubes` is a list of `n+1` cubes with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits from 0 to 9**
