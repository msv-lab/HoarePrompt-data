Example Answer:
The code takes input for `n` and then creates a list of `n` cubes, where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers. Since `n` is between 1 and 3, the input will be valid. Each cube will have 6 integers between 0 and 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9**
