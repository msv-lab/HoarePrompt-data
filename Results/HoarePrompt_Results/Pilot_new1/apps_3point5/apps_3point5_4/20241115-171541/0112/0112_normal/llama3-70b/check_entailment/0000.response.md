Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of cubes Masha has and the digits on each face of the cubes.
- It then extracts all unique digits from these cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and concatenates them to form the maximum possible number.
- This approach ensures that Masha can build all numbers from 1 to the maximum number formed by the digits on the cubes.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for all valid inputs.
