According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the cube variable will iterate over each cube in the cubes list. Since n is the number of cubes in the list, for the loop to execute, n must be at least 1. Additionally, to start the loop, the cube variable needs to be the first cube in the cubes list.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes with at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the cubes list**
