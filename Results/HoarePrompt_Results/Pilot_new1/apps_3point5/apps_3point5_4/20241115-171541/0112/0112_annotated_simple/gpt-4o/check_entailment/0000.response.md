Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and can_form_number. 
2. The func_1 function calculates the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes to form integers from 1 to x. It iterates through numbers starting from 1 until it can no longer form the next number.
3. The can_form_number function checks if a given number can be formed using the available cube faces. It iterates through each digit in the number and checks if there is a cube face that contains that digit.
4. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if Masha can form all integers from 1 to x using the provided cube faces. 
5. The annotations provide clarity on the purpose of each function and the logic flow within the program.
6. Since the program logic aligns with the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected, the correctness is determined to be True.
