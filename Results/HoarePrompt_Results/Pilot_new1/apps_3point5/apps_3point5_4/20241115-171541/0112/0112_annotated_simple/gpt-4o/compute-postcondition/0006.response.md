Example Answer:
The i-th element of used_cubes is set to True, where i is 0. Therefore, the 0th element of used_cubes is now True. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube; digits is a list of individual digits of an unknown number with at least 1 digit, digit is the first digit in the list; used_cubes is a list of n False values with the 0th element set to True; found is False; i is 0**
