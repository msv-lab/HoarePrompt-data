Postcondition: ***If the digit is found in any of the cube_faces, found is True, and used_cubes will have the corresponding index set to True. If the digit is not found in any cube_faces, found remains False, and used_cubes remains all False. If n is 0, the loop does not execute. After the if statement executes, if found is False, the program returns False. In all other cases, the state of the program variables remains unchanged from the precondition.***
