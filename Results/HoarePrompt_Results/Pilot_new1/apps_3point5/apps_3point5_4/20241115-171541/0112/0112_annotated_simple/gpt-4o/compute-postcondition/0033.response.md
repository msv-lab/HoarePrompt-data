Functionality: **The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of cubes, and `cube_faces`, a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. The function iterates through each digit in the list 'digits' and checks if the digit is present in any of the cube_faces. If the digit is found in any cube_faces, the corresponding index in 'used_cubes' is set to True. If all digits are found in the cube_faces, the function returns True. If any digit is not found, the function returns False. If n is 0, the loop does not execute.**
