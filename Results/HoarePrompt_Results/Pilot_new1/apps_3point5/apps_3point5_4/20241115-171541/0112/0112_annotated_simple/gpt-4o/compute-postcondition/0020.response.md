According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists, digits is a list of individual digits of an unknown number with at least 1 digit, digit is the first digit in the list, used_cubes is a list of n Boolean values with the 1st and ith elements set to True if not already set to True and the rest remain False, found is True if the digit is found in the faces of the 1st cube, i is 2. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists, digits is a list of individual digits of an unknown number with at least 1 digit, digit is the first digit in the list, used_cubes is a list of n Boolean values with the 1st and 3rd elements set to True if not already set to True and the rest remain False, found is True if the digit is found in the faces of the 1st cube, i is 3**
