According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the availability of unused cubes with the specified digit in its faces. If there is at least one such cube available, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if no cube with the specified digit is found, found will remain False. If found is False after the execution of the if else block, the program will return False. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to ensure that there is at least one unused cube with the specified digit in its faces.
State: **If there is at least one unused cube with the specified digit in its faces**
