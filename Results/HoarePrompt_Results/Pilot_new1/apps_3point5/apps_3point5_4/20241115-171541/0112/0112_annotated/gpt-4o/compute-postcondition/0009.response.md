Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, num is a positive integer, digits is a list of string representations of the integer num with at least 1 digit, used_cubes is a list of n boolean values where the ith value is True if not already set to True, found is True if a cube with the specified digit is found in the cube_faces list, i is 0. If the condition not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i] is satisfied, the ith value in used_cubes is set to True, found is set to True, and the loop breaks.***
