According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n` and the length of the `cubes` list. If `n` is less than 3 or the length of `cubes` is less than 3, the loop will not execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 1, 2, or 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 cubes obtained from user input split by spaces. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to 3 and the `cubes` list should contain at least 4 cubes.
State: **`n` is 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 4 cubes obtained from user input split by spaces, `digits` is a set containing all the individual digits extracted from the cubes**
