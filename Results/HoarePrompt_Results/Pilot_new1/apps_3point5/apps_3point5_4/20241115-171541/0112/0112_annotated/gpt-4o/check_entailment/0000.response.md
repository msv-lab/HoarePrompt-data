Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The `can_form_number` function does not handle the restriction that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the code may not correctly determine the largest natural number x that Masha can make using her cubes. Specifically, if Masha has cubes with both 6 and 9 on their faces, the code may allow the formation of numbers that violate the restriction mentioned in the problem description. This inconsistency makes the code incorrect.
