Example Answer:
The code iterates over each cube in the list `cubes`, extracts each digit from the cube, converts it to a string, and updates the set `digits` with the individual digits. The initial state includes `n` being 1, 2, or 3; `cubes` containing at least 3 cubes obtained from user input split by spaces for each iteration of the range of `n`. After execution, the set `digits` will contain all the individual digits extracted from the cubes.
Output State: **`n` is 1, 2, or 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 cubes obtained from user input split by spaces for each iteration of the range of `n`; `digits` is a set containing all the individual digits extracted from the cubes**
