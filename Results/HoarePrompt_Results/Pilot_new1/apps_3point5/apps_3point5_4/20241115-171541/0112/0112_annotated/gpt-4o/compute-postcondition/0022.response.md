Postcondition: ***If there is at least one unused cube with the specified digit in its faces, the loop will set the corresponding value in used_cubes to True, set found to True, and break the loop. The loop will execute at most n times, depending on the number of cubes available. If no cube with the specified digit is found, found will remain False and used_cubes will not be modified. If found is False, the loop will not modify used_cubes and found will remain False***
