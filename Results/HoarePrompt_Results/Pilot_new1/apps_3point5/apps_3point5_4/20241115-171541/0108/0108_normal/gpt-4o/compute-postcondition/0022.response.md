Postcondition: ***If the length of `s` is less than 1 or `target_len` is 0, the loop will not execute. If `s` is not empty and `target_len` is greater than 0, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`. If `j` is equal to `target_len`, then the function prints `target`. Otherwise, if `j` is less than `target_len`, the function prints -1.***
