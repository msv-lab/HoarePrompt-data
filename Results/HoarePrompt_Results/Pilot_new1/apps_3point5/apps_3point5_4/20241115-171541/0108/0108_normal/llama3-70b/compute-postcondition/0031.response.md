According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is in `s` with the first occurrence replaced by the next character in ASCII sequence. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the `char` should be present in `s` with the next character in ASCII sequence. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`char` is in `s` with the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` has `char` added to it**
