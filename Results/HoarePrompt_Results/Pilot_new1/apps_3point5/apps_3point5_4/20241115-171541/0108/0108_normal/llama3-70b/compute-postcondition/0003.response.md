According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the alphabet. Since the alphabet is fixed and contains all lowercase English letters, the loop will always execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that res is updated with each character in the alphabet. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state should be:
State: **s is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', res is updated with each character in the alphabet**
