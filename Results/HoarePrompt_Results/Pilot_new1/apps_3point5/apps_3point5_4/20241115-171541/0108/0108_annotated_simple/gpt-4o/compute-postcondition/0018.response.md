Postcondition: ***If `j` is equal to `target_len`, then `s` matches `target` in order. `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to 26. If `s` does not match `target`, `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than 26. If `s` is shorter than `target`, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is less than 26. If `s` is longer than `target`, `i` is greater than the length of `s`, `j` is equal to 26***
