Postcondition: ***If 'a' is present in s, res will contain each letter from 'a' to 'z' repeated the number of times they appear in s, in alphabetical order. s will be the updated string with each occurrence of a letter replaced by the next letter in the alphabet. char will be the next character in the alphabet. If 'a' is not present in s, res will be empty, s will remain unchanged, and char will be 'b'. The loop will not execute if s does not contain any letters from the alphabet. If the length of res is 26, it will print res; otherwise, it will print -1.***
