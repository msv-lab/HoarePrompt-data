According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is updated with the next character in the alphabet after the new `char`, and `s` is not affected. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the current `char` value needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is updated with the next character in the alphabet after the new `char`, `s` is not affected**
