The function `func` reads an input string `s` and iterates through the alphabet. It replaces each character in the alphabet found in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If the length of the resulting string `res` is 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value.
