Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It iterates through the alphabet and replaces each character in the input string `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If the resulting string contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, it prints the string; otherwise, it prints -1. The code handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence by returning -1. The annotations provided also align with the logic of the code and do not highlight any discrepancies. Therefore, based on the problem description, examples, code, and annotations, the code is correct.
