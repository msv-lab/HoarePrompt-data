The function reads a string `s` and compares it character by character with the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If the characters in `s` match the characters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in order, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function operates on a string `s` consisting of small English letters and checks for a sequential match with the alphabet.
