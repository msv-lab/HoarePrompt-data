Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced by the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The replacement is done only once. The previous state of `s` is a string with the character before the last character in the alphabet replaced by the last character. The updated `s` will have the replacement done. The variable `alphabet` is not affected. The variable `res` is not used in this snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the character before the last character in the alphabet replaced by the last character after one replacement; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string with the added character.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character before the last character in the alphabet replaced by the last character after one replacement; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is a string with the added character**
