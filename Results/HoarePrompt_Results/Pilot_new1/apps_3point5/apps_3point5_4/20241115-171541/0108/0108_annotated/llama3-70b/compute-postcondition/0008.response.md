Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced by the next character in the alphabet once. The value of `char` is unknown, but the value of `s` is known to have the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. The value of `alphabet` is not affected. The result is stored in `res`. 
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet once, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
