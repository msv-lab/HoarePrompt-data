According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet` string. Since `alphabet` is fixed and contains all small English letters, the loop will execute 26 times. Before the loop starts, `res` is an empty string, so it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `res` remains an empty string.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string**
