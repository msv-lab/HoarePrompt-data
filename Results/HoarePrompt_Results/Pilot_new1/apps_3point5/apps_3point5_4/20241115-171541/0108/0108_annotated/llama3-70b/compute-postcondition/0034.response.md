According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is still in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has been modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters, and `char` is still in `s`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`s` has been modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters, `char` is still in `s`**
