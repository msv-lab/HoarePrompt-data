Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The value of `char` is already present in `s` and is replaced by the next character in the alphabet once. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet once, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet once, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
