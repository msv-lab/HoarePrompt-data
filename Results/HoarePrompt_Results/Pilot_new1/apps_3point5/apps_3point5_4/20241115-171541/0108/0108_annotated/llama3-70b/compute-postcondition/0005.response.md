Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The replacement is done only once. The value of `char` is unknown, but it is a small English letter. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet once, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet once, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
