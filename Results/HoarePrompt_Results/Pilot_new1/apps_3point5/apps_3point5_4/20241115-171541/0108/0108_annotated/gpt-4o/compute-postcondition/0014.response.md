Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` may or may not be incremented based on the comparison of `s[i]` and `target[j]`. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, `j` is incremented by 1. In all cases, the program updates the state of `j` based on the comparison of `s[i]` and `target[j]`.***
