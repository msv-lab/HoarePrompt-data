Correctness: True

Explanation: The program iterates through each character in the alphabet and replaces occurrences of that character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. It then checks if the resulting string contains all the characters in the alphabet. If it does, it prints the resulting string, otherwise it prints -1. The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the expected output.
