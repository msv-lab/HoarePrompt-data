Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to check if a number contains at most `k` different digits and calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy this condition. The program then reads the input values for `l`, `r`, and `k`, calculates the total sum using `func_2`, and prints the result modulo `998244353`.

The program iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r` and checks if each number satisfies the condition of having at most `k` different digits by using the `func_1` function. If a number meets the condition, it is added to the total sum modulo `998244353`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases, it can be considered correct.
