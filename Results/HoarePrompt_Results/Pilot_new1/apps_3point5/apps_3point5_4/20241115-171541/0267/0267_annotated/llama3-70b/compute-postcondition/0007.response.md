Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary to store intermediate results. If the key (n, k) exists in dp, the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables. If k equals 0, the function returns 0. n is less than 10 to the power of k**
