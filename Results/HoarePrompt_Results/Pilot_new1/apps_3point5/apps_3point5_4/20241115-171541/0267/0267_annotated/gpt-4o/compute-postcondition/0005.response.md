According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to `num + 1` and `l` should remain less than or equal to `r`.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, initially 0. `num` is equal to `l + 1`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
