According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 3. Since `i` is 3 and the loop runs while `i` is less than `k`, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 10, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 4, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the provided formula**
