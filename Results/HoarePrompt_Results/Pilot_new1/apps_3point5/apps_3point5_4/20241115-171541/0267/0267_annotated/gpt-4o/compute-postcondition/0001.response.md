According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. For the loop to execute, the range from `l` to `r` inclusive must have at least one element. Since `total_sum` is 0, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
