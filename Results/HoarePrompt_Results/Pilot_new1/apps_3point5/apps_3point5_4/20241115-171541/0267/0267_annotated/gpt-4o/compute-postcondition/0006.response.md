Example Answer:
The value of `num` is calculated as `l + 1`, where `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Then, `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and taking the modulo `MOD`. The output state will be the updated value of `total_sum` after the operation.
Output State: **`total_sum` is an integer, updated value after performing the operation**
