According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with dp[(n, k)] updated according to the given formula, i is 4**
