The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l`, `r`, and `k` are integers satisfying 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. The function calculates the result of (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. The functionality involves invoking the `count` function with specific parameters and performing arithmetic operations on the results.
