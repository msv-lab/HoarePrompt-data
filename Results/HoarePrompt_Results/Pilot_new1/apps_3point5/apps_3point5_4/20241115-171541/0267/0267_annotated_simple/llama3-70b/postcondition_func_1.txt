Functionality: The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary used to store intermediate results. 

The function checks for three cases:
Case 1: If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0 without making any changes to `n`, `k`, or `dp`.
Case 2: If the tuple `(n, k)` is already present in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]` without making any changes to `n`, `k`, or `dp`.
Case 3: Otherwise, the function calculates and updates the value in `dp[n, k]` based on the given formula and returns it.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` to store intermediate results. It returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]` based on the conditions mentioned in the cases.
