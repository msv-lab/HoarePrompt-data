Output State: **If k is greater than 1, the loop will execute k - 1 times and update dp[(n, k)] according to the given formula. If k is 1 or less, the loop won't execute. After the loop executes, n remains a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with dp[(n, k)] updated, and i is equal to k - 1.**
