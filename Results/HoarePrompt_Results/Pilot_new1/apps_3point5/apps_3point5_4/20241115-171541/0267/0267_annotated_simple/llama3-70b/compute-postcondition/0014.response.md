According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 1. Since `i` is less than `k`, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with dp[(n, k)] updated according to the given formula, i is 3**
