According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1. Since the loop iterates from 1 to k-1, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be k-1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` has been updated based on the given expression, i is k-1**
