The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, otherwise prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative, then prints 'YES', otherwise prints 'NO'. The function covers all possible scenarios based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
