Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input split by spaces and converted to integers. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` can be any integers within the given range. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9**
