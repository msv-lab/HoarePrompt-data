Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. The value of `c` is not equal to 0. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed, and the variables remain unchanged. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed, and the variables remain within the specified range. All possible edge cases and conditions are covered in the postcondition.***
