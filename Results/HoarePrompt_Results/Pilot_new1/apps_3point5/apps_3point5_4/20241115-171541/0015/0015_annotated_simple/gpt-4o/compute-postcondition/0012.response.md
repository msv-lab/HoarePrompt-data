Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with the newly input values. `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This covers all possible scenarios where the program can either print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the specified conditions, ensuring all edge cases are accounted for.***
