Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, `total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4. The output state is: `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is the total number of fruits obtained by multiplying `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is the total number of fruits obtained by multiplying `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4**
