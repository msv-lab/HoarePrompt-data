Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes three integer inputs representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has.
- It then calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the division constraints (1 lemon for every 2 apples and 4 pears).
- Finally, it computes the sum of the minimum number of lemons and the two largest numbers from the set {a, b, c} and prints the result.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case, ensuring that Nikolay can cook the compote with the correct ratio of fruits. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
