Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given ratios. The min_lemon variable is calculated by finding the minimum of the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and one-fourth of the number of pears. Then, the total number of fruits is calculated by multiplying the min_lemon with the respective ratios and adding them up. This logic follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
