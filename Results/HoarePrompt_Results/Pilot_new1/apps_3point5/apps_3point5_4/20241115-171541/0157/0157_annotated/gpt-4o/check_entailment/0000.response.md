Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote by considering the ratio of 1:2:4. The code correctly determines the maximum number of lemons based on the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. Then, it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum lemons with their corresponding values (1, 2, and 4) and prints the result. The code handles cases where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote, as indicated in the problem description. The annotations also accurately describe the functionality of the code, aligning with the problem description. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified.
