Correctness: False

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the calculation of `min_lemon`. The code calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. However, this calculation does not ensure that the fruits are in the required ratio of 1:2:4. 

For example, consider the input:
a = 2
b = 3
c = 2

According to the problem description, Nikolay should be able to use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears to cook the compote. However, the code calculates `min_lemon` as 1 (minimum of 2, 3//2, 2//4), which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description, making the correctness as False.
