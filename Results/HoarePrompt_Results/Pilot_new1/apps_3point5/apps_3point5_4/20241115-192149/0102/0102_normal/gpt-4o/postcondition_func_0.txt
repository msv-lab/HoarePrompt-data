The function func_1 accepts an integer n between 0 and 99 and returns the string representation of n based on specific conditions. If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the string representation from the `ones` list. If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation from the `teens` list. For n between 10 and 99, if n is divisible by 10, it returns the string representing the tens place from the `tens` list. If n is not divisible by 10, it returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place from the `tens` list, a hyphen, and the string representing the ones place from the `ones` list. The function handles all boundary cases and edge cases within the specified range and conditions.
