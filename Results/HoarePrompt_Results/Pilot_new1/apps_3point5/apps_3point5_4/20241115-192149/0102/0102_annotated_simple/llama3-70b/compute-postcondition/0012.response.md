Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is less than 10, the program prints the corresponding value from the 'ones' array. If `s` is between 10 and 19 (inclusive), the program prints the corresponding value from the 'teens' array. If `s` is 20 or greater, the program prints the concatenation of the corresponding value from the 'tens' array and the 'ones' array, separated by a hyphen if the remainder of `s` divided by 10 is not 0. The postcondition covers all cases and edge scenarios for the given program fragment.***
