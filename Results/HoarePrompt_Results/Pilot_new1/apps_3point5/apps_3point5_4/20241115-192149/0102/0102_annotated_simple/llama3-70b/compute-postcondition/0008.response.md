Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value at the index `s - 10` of the list `teens`. Since `s` is an input integer between 10 and 19, the index `s - 10` will be between 0 and 9, inclusive. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input integer, and the value of `s` is greater than or equal to 10. The value of `s` is less than 20.
Output State: **`s` is an input integer, and the value of `s` is greater than or equal to 10. The value of `s` is less than 20**
