Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer, and the value of `s` is greater than or equal to 10. If `s` is less than 20, the program prints the corresponding value from the 'teens' array based on `s - 10`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 20, the program prints the concatenation of the corresponding value from the 'tens' array based on `s // 10` and the corresponding value from the 'ones' array based on `s % 10`, separated by a hyphen if `s % 10` is not equal to 0. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
