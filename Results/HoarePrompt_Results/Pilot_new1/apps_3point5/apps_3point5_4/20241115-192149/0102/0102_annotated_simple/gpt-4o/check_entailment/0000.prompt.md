You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven',
    'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    if (0 <= n <= 9) :
        return ones[n]
        #The program returns the string representation of the number 'n' in the ones place
    else :
        if (11 <= n <= 19) :
            return teens[n - 10]
            #The program returns the string representation of the number `n` in the list `teens`
        else :
            if (10 <= n <= 99) :
                if (n % 10 == 0) :
                    return tens[n // 10]
                    #The program returns the string representing the tens place of the integer `n`
                else :
                    return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of the integer 'n' in words.
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer where 10 <= s <= 99, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from zero to ninety, and `n` is an integer between 10 and 99. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `n`. The postcondition covers all edge cases including n being a multiple of 10, n being in the teens range, and n being any other two-digit number.
            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is an integer where 10 <= s <= 99, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, and `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from zero to ninety. The integer `n` is between 10 and 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`. If `n` is in the teens range, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens`. For any other two-digit number, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `n`. The postcondition covers all edge cases for the given ranges of `n` and the appropriate representations are returned based on the conditions met.

The integer `n` is between 10 and 99. If `n` is in the range of 11 to 19, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens`. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`.

The integer `n` can be any value between 0 and 99. If `n` is in the range of 0 to 9, the function returns the corresponding string from `ones`. If `n` is in the range of 11 to 19, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens`. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`. For any other two-digit number, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `n`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the given ranges of `n`, ensuring that the appropriate representations are returned based on the conditions met.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
