Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the input values after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n` and `a` are unknown, so after execution, `a` will contain n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n**
