Example Answer:
The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the integer 1 in the list `a`. The list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, so the index of 1 in the list will be the position of 1 in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`**
