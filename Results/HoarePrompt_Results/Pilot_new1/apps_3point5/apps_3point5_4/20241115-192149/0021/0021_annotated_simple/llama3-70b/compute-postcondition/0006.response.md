Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist` and prints the result. 
- `max_dist` is `n - 2` 
- `min_dist` is the minimum value between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`
- `pos1` is 0
- `posn` is `n - 1`

Since `pos1` is 0 and `posn` is `n - 1`, `min_dist` is the minimum value between `abs(0 - (n - 1)) - 1` and `n - 2`, which simplifies to `min_dist` being the minimum value between `n - 1` and `n - 2`, resulting in `min_dist` being `n - 2`.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- n is an input integer
- a is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n
- pos1 is 0
- posn is n-1
- max_dist is n-2
- min_dist is n-2

Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, pos1 is 0, posn is n-1, max_dist is n-2, min_dist is n-2**
