Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by taking input, finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, calculating the maximum possible distance between them after one swap, and then printing the result. The logic used in the program is correct and will work for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program handles the scenario where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array, and in that case, it performs an unnecessary swap to maximize the distance between them.
