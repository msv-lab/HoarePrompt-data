The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the preconditions that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then performs some operations based on these preconditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on a list `a` of n distinct integers from 1 to n, where n is an integer between 2 and 100.
