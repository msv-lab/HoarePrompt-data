Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by taking the input of the size of the permutation and the elements of the permutation. It then calculates the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculates the distances between these elements and the ends of the array. Finally, it prints the maximum distance achievable by performing one swap. The logic of the program seems correct and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
