Example Answer:
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, which is 0 in this case. Therefore, `dist3` is 0. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is `n-1`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `n-1`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n-1` and `n-1`, `dist3` is 0**
