Correctness: **True**

The code reads the input correctly, stores the bus routes information in a list of tuples, calculates the minimum time for a bus to arrive at the target time, and prints the index of the bus that arrives earliest. The code follows the problem description for every potential case provided in the examples. The annotations also accurately describe the state of the program at different points, helping to understand the flow of the code. Since the code works as expected for all cases mentioned in the problem description and the annotations do not hint at any edge cases that are not covered, the correctness of the code is true.
