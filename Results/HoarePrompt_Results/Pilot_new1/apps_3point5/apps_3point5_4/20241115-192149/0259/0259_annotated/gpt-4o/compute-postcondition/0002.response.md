According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the min_wait_time is positive infinity and chosen_route is -1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, min_wait_time should be positive infinity, chosen_route should be -1, and i should be 0.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
