According to the code, the loop will execute n times. The loop depends on the variable `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer. At the start of the loop, `buses` is an empty list, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect that. Additionally, since `_` is used as a placeholder variable, it does not impact the loop execution. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer satisfying constraints, `buses` is an empty list**
