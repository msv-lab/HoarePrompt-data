Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`. If the source of bus route `i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the given program fragment, including the boundary values and edge cases.***
