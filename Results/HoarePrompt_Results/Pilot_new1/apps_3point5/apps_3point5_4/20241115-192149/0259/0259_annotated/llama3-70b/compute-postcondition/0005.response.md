According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer satisfying constraints, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)` appended to it, where `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting, `n` is the previous value incremented by 1**
