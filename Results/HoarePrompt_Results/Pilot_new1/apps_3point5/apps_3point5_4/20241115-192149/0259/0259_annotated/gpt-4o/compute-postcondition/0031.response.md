Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, where `t` is not defined in the initial state. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. The output state after running the code is not directly calculable without the value of `t`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the updated minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[i]**
