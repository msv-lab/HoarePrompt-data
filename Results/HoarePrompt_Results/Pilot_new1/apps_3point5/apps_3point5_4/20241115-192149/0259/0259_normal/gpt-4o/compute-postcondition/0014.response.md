Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is a positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the source of the ith bus route, d_i is the destination of the ith bus route. If s_i >= t, then wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If s_i < t and (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, wait_time is set to 0. Otherwise, if s_i < t and ((t - s_i) % d_i) != 0, wait_time is determined as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases related to the values of s_i, t, and d_i. Additionally, after entering the if condition, wait_time is less than min_wait_time.**
