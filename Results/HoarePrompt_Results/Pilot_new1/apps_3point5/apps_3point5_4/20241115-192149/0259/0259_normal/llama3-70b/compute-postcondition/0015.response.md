According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start, `min_time` is positive infinity and `ans` is -1. So for the loop to be executed, the buses list must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list.
State: **`min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, buses is a list of tuples with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list**
