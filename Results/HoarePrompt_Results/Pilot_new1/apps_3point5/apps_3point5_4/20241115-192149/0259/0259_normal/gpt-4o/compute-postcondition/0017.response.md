According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, and chosen_route is set to i + 1 where i is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is set to i + 2 where i is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time.**
