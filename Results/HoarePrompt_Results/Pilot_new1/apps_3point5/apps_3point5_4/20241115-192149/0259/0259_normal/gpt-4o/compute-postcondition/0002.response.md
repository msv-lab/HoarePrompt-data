According to the code, the loop will execute n times based on the range(n). Therefore, the loop will execute as long as n is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the initial values are `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
