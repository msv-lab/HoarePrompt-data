Output State: **If n is 0, the loop does not execute. If n is greater than 0, the loop iterates over each bus route in bus_routes. For each iteration, s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the current bus route. If s_i >= t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If s_i < t and (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, wait_time is set to 0. Otherwise, wait_time is determined as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. After each iteration, min_wait_time is updated to the minimum wait time among all bus routes, and chosen_route is updated to the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. At the end of the loop, the output state includes the final values of min_wait_time, chosen_route, and the relationships between the variables based on the bus routes and their wait times.**
