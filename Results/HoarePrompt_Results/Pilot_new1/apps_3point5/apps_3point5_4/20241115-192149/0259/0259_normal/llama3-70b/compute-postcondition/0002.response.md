According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `buses` being an empty list does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is an empty list**
