Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the source of the ith bus route, d_i is the destination of the ith bus route. s_i is less than t. The difference between t and s_i is divisible by d_i, wait_time is 0**
