According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The loop does not depend on any specific variables other than `n`. Before the loop starts, `buses` is an empty list, so it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` is an empty list**
