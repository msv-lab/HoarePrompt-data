Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values, stores them in a list of tuples, and then iterates through the list to find the bus route that Serval will use based on the given conditions. The logic used to calculate the time and determine the bus route is correct. The program outputs the correct bus route index according to the problem description for all the provided examples. Additionally, there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the code.
