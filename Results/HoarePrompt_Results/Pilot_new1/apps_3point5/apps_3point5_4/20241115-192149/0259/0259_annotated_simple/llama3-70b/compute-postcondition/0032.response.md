Output State: 
If n is between 1 and 100, and buses contains at least one tuple (s, d), the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, min_time will hold the minimum time calculated from (t - s) % d, ans will be the index of the tuple with the minimum time plus 1. If there are multiple tuples with the same minimum time, ans will hold the index of the first occurrence. If n is less than 1 or greater than 100, or buses is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and min_time will remain positive infinity, and ans will stay as -1.
