According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` contains tuples including the newly appended tuple (s, d)**
