Example Answer:
No variables are affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` is an empty list**
