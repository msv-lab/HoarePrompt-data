According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0 and `i` should be initialized to 0.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
