Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time` are all updated based on the conditions provided. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
