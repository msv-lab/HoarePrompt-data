According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the loop variable `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `_` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` contains tuples including the newly appended tuple (s, d), `_` is incremented by 1**
