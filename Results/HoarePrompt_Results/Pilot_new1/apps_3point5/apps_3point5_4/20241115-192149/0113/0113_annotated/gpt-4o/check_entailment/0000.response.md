Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` calculates the k-rounding of n by finding the minimum positive integer x that ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n. The code uses the formula x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)) to calculate this value, where multiplier is determined by 10 ** k. The math module is used to calculate the greatest common divisor.

All the provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code, and the annotations also align with the problem description. The code returns the expected output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the code is true.
