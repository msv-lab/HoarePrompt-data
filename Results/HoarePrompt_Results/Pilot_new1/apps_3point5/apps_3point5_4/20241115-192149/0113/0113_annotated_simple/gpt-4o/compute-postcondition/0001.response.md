Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `n` multiplied by `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and the value of `k` is a positive integer between 0 and 8, which determines the value of `multiplier` as 10^k. The `math.gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. Therefore, the output state is `n` and `k` remain positive integers within the specified range, and `multiplier` is 10 raised to the power of `k`. `x` is assigned the result of `n` multiplied by `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` remain positive integers within the specified range, `multiplier` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, `x` is assigned the result of `n` multiplied by `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`**
