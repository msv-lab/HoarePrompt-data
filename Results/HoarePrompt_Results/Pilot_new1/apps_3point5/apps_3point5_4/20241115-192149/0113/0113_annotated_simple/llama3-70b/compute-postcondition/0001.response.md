Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned as 10 to the power of `k`. Given that `k` ranges from 0 to 8, `x` can take values from 1 to 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100000000.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100000000**
