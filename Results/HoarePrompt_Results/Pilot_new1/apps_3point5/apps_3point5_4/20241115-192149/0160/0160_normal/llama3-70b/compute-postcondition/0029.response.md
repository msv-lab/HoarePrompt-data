According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `gcd` and `N`. If `N` is at least 2 and the loop condition is met, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if N is at least 2, after the execution of the if statement, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i` where i * i is not equal to gcd. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the conditions are that N is at least 2 and the loop condition is still met. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If N is at least 2, `max_divisor` has been updated, other variables remain unchanged.**
