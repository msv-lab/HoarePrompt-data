Postcondition: ***If N is at least 2, after the execution of the if statement, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i` where i * i is not equal to gcd. This ensures that `max_divisor` is correctly updated in scenarios where gcd % i == 0 and i * i != gcd. In all other cases, including when N is less than 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
