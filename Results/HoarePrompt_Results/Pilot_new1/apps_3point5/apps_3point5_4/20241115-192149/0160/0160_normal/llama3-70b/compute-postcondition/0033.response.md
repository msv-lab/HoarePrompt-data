Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers N and K from the input, followed by a list of integers A. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A. After that, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of the gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor calculated. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value.**
