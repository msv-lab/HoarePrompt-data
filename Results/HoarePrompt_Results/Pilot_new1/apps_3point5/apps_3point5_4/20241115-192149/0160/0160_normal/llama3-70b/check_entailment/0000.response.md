Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers N and K from the input, followed by a list of integers A, which matches the problem description.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A, which is the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
- The code then finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of the gcd, which is a valid approach to finding the maximum possible positive integer.
- Finally, it prints the maximum divisor calculated, which is the expected output based on the problem description.
- The code handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description.
- The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct for all potential cases.
