According to the code, the loop can execute if `gcd` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `max_divisor` is dependent on `N` and the elements in list `A`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `N` must be at least 2, `max_divisor` should be the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`, and `gcd` should be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **If N is at least 2, then `max_divisor` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1**
