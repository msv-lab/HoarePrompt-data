Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates through all numbers up to the square root of the gcd to find the maximum divisor that can divide every element in A. The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
