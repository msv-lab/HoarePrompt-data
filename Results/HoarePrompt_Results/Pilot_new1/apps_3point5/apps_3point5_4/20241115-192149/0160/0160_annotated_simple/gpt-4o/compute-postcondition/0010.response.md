According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2, and the loop has processed up to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. To execute one more time, the loop needs to process the next value of `i`, which would be `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` and check if `x` is divisible by this new `i`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the upper bound of the loop.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
