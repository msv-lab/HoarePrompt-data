Postcondition: ***N is an integer, gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, i is 3. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd divided by i. If the condition i * i != gcd is not met, then there is no change in the values of N, gcd, i, and max_divisor.***
