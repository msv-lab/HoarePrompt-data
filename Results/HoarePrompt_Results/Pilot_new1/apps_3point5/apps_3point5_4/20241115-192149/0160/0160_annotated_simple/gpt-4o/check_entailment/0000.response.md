Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `lst`. This is essential for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A` after the operations.
2. Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly generates all the divisors of a given integer `x` and returns them in sorted order. This is necessary for determining the factors that can divide every element of `A` after the operations.
3. Both functions are implemented correctly and fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The logic in the functions aligns with the problem statement, ensuring that the program can determine the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A` after the operations.
