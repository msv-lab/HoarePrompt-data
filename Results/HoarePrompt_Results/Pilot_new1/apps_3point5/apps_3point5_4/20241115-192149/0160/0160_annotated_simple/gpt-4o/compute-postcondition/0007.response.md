Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`, which contains factors of `x` up to 2. Since `i` is 2, it will be added to the set `divisors`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 2.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 2**
