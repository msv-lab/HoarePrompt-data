Postcondition: ***N is an integer, gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, i is 3. If gcd % i is equal to 0 and i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd divided by i. If gcd % i is not equal to 0, or if i * i is equal to gcd, there is no change in the values of N, gcd, i, and max_divisor.***
