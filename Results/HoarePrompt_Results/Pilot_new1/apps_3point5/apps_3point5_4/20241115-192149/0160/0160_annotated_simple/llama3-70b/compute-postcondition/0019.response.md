According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A`, and `i` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `i` is currently 1, it should be adjusted to 2 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **N is an integer, gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, i is 2**
