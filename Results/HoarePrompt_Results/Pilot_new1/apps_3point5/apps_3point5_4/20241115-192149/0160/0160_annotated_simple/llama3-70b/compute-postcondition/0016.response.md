Output State: **N is 2 or greater, gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, i is 1. If N is less than 2, gcd is the initial value of A[0], max_divisor is updated to be the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i where gcd is divisible by i, and the square of i is not equal to gcd.**
