According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1 and the result of `x // i`. The values of `x`, `i`, and the square root of `x` remain unchanged after the if statement. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1 and the result of `x // (i + 1)`. The values of `x`, `i + 1`, and the square root of `x` remain unchanged**
