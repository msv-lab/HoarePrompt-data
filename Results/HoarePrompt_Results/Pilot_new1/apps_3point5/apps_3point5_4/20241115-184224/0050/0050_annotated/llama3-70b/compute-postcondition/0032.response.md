According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least the largest element in `s`, `shares` contains the total number of shares, `r` is greater than or equal to the current element in `s` at the start of the loop. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `m` should be greater than the current value of `i`.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least the largest element in `s`, `shares` contains the total number of shares, `r` is greater than or equal to the current element in `s` at the start of the loop**.
