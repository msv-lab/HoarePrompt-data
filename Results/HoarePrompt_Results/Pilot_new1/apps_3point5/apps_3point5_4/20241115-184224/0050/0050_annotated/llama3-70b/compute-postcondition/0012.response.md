Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is any positive integer, `shares` is an integer. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the result of the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop or if statement is exited.***
