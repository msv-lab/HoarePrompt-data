Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where the input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and assigned to `n`, `m`, and `r` respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are constrained by the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
