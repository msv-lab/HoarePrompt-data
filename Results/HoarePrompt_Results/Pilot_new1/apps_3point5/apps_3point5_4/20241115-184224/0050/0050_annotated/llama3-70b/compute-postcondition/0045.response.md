The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the sum of the products of two lists `s` and `b`, where the lists `s` and `b` are generated based on the input parameters `n`, `m`, and `r` following certain rules. The function follows the constraints: **Precondition**: **n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000**.
