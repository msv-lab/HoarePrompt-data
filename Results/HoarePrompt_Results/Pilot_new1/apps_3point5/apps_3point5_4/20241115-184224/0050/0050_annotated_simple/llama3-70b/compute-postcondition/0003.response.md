Example Answer:
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the list `s` are unknown, but after sorting, the list `s` is rearranged in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space**
