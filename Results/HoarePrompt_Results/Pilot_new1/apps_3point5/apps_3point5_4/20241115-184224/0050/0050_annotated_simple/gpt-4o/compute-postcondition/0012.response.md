Postcondition: ***n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; s_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= n, m; s is a list of integers obtained from input(); b is a list of integers obtained from input(); min_buy_price is the minimum value in the list s; max_sell_price is the maximum value in the list b. If max_sell_price is less than or equal to min_buy_price, the program prints r. Otherwise, max_shares is calculated as r divided by min_buy_price, remaining_bourles is the remainder of r divided by min_buy_price, and total_bourles is computed as max_shares multiplied by max_sell_price plus remaining_bourles. The program then prints total_bourles.***
