According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain the same**
