Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly identifies the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. It then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial bourles and determines the remaining bourles after buying those shares. Finally, it calculates the total bourles after selling all the shares at the maximum sell price. The logic provided in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
