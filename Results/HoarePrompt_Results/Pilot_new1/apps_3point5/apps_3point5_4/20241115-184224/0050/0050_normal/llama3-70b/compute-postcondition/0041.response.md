Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `shares` and `b[i]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If shares is 0, `r` remains greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
