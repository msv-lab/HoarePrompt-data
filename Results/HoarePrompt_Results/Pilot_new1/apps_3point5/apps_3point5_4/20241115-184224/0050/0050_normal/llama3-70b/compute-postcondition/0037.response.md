According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop needs to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0**
