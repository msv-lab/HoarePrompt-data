Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are now determined based on the input provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
