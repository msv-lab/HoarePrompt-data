Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the program prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of the division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. The program then prints the value of `total_bourles`, covering all edge cases and summarizing the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes.***
