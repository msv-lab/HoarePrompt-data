The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from the input, followed by two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it computes the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buy price, calculates the remaining currency after buying those shares, and finally determines the total currency after selling the maximum shares at the maximum sell price. The function then prints the total currency. The function does not have a return value.
