Example Answer:
Initially, `a` is the previous value of `b`, and `b` is the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b`. After executing `a, b = b, a % b`, `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b`. 
Output State: **a is the previous value of the remainder of the division of the previous values of a and b, b is the remainder of the division of the previous values of a and b**
