According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `sequence[i]` and `sequence[k - 2]` are either incremented by 1 or remain the same based on the previous value of `remainder`, `remainder` is decremented by 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i - 1` and `remainder` needs to be decremented by 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sequence[i]` and `sequence[k - 2]` are either incremented by 1 or remain the same based on the previous value of `remainder`, `remainder` is decremented by 4, `i` is adjusted to `i - 1`**
