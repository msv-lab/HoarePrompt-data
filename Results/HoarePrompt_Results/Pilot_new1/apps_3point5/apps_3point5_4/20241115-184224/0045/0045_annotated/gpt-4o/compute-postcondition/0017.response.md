Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is greater than n, `i` is one less than the current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration. If the remainder is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues execution, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, `remainder` is decremented by 1**
