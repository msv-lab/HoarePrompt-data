Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. `min_sum` is greater than n. `i` is the current value at the end of the last iteration + 1. `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 if remainder is not 0. `remainder` is decremented by 1 if remainder is not 0. If remainder is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop.***
