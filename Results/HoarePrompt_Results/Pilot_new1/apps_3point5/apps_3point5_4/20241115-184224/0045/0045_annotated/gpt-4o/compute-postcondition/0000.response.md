Example Answer:
`min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` is a positive integer. The value of `min_sum` is calculated based on the value of `k`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `k`, the output state is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is calculated based on the value of k.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is calculated based on the value of k**
