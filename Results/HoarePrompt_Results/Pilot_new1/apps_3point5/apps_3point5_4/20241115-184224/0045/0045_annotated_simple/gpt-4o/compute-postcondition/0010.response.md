Postcondition: ***`min_sum`, `n`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`, `i`, `k` are as described in the precondition. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of the variables after the execution of the if statement.***
