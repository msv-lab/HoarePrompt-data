Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is a helper function that can be used to find the maximum greatest common divisor of a sequence of numbers, which is required in the problem description. The function logic is correct and will work for all inputs, ensuring that the main program can find the correct sequence of positive numbers with the maximum greatest common divisor.
