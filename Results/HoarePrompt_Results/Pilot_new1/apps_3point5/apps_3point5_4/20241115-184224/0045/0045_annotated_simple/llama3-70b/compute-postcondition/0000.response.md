Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, the new values of `a` and `b` will be updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations**
