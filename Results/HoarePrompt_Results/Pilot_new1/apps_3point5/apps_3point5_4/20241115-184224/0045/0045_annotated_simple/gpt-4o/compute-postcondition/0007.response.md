According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`. Since the loop is iterating from `k - 1` to `0`, `i` should be set to `k - 1` at the start. 
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `n` is the input number, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)`, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is greater than 0**
