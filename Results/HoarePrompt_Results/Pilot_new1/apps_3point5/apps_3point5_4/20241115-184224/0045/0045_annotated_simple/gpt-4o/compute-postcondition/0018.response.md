According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum`, `n`, `d`, `remainder` are decreased by 2, `sequence` has the value at index `i` incremented by 1, `i` is decreased by 1, `k` remains the same. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop breaks out. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`min_sum`, `n`, `d`, `remainder` are decreased by 2, `sequence` has the value at index `i-1` incremented by 1, `i` is decreased by 1, `k` remains the same**
