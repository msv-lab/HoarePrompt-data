Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings and removes any leading zeroes.
- It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints the corresponding symbol '<', '>', or '=' based on the relationship between the two numbers.
- The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. It correctly handles cases where `a` is less than `b`, `a` is greater than `b`, and when `a` is equal to `b`.
- The output hints also confirm that the code is functioning as expected and that the output symbols are correctly printed based on the comparison of `a` and `b`.
