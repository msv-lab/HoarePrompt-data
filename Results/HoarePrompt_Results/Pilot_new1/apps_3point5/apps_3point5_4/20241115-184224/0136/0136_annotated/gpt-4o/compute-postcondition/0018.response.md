Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. `a` is greater than `b` in value. If `a` was initially an empty string, it has been updated to '0'. If `b` was initially an empty string, it has been set to '0'. The length of `a` is not greater than the length of `b` and `a` is greater than `b`***
