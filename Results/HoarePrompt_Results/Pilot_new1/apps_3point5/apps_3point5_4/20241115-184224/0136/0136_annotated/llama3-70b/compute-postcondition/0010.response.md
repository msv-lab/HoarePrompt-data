Postcondition: ***a, b are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros. If a equals b, the program prints '='. If a is less than b, the program prints '<'. If a is not equal to b and a is greater than or equal to b, the program prints '>'. This accounts for all possible scenarios when comparing a and b as integers represented by strings.***
