Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated by removing any leading zeros from the second element of the list `data`. The variable `a` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros**
