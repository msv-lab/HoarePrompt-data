Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If the integer value of `a` is greater than the integer value of `b`, the program prints '>'. If the integer value of `a` is less than the integer value of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the integer value of `a` is equal to the integer value of `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` was initially an empty string, it has been updated to '0'. If `b` was initially an empty string, it has been set to '0'. The length of `a` is not greater than the length of `b`. In all cases, the program correctly compares the integer values of `a` and `b` and outputs the corresponding comparison result.***
