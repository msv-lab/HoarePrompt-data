Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing leading zeros. The variable `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. The other variable `b` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
