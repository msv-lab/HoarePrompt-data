Example Answer: 
The variable `b` is assigned the input value after removing leading zeros using the `lstrip()` function. The initial state assigns the input value to variable `a` after removing leading zeros. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is assigned the input value after removing leading zeros, `b` is assigned the input value after removing leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the input value after removing leading zeros, `b` is assigned the input value after removing leading zeros**
