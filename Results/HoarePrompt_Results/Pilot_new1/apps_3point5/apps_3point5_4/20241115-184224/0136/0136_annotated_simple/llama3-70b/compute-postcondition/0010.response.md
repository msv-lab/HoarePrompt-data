Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned input values after removing leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. The program executes correctly for all possible cases where `a` and `b` are not equal, covering both the '<' and '>' outcomes.***
