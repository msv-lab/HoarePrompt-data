Correctness: True

The program correctly handles the input of two very long integers with leading zeros. It compares the values of the integers after removing leading zeros and prints the appropriate symbol '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison. The logic in the code covers all possible cases where the integers are not equal, ensuring the correct output for each case.
