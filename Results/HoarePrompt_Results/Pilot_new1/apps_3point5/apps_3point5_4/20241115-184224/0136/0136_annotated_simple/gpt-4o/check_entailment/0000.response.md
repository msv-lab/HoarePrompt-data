Correctness: True

The program takes two non-negative integers as input, removes any leading zeros, and compares them. It correctly outputs "<" if the first number is less than the second, ">" if the first number is greater than the second, and "=" if they are equal. The logic of comparing the numbers based on their lengths and values is implemented correctly. The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and handles them appropriately.
