Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two very long integers a and b as input.
2. It removes any leading zeroes from both a and b.
3. Then it compares the lengths of a and b, if they are not equal, it prints the appropriate symbol.
4. If the lengths are equal, then it compares the actual values of a and b as strings and prints the appropriate symbol.
5. The program correctly handles the case where a and b are equal, a is less than b, and a is greater than b.
6. The logic provided in the program matches the problem description for all potential cases.
