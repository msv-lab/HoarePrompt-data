The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and calculates the greatest common divisor of their initial values. If `b` is 0 at the beginning, the function returns the value of `a`. If `b` is not 0, the function iteratively calculates the greatest common divisor until `b` becomes 0, and then returns the resulting value of `a`.
