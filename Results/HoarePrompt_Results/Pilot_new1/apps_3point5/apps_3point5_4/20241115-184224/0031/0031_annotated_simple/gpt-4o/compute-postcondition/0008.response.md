According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is assigned the value of shifting 1 left by n, numerator is assigned the value 1, denominator is assigned the value 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
