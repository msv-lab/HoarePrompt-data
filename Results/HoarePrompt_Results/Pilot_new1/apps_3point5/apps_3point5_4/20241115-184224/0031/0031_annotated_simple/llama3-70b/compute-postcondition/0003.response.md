According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If k is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, so they already satisfy the conditions for the loop to execute. Additionally, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
