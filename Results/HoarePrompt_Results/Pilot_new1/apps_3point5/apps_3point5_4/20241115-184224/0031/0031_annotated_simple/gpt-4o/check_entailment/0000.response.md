Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days.
2. The program handles the case where k is greater than the total number of days in a year (2^n) by printing 1 1.
3. The functions func_1 and func_2 are logically implemented and perform the required calculations as described in the problem statement.
4. The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prints the irreducible fraction A/B modulo 10^6 + 3.
