Output State: 

The loop calculates the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range from 0 to k-1 and stores it in numerator, while updating denominator by multiplying it by total_days each time. If k is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and numerator and denominator remain as 1. 
After the loop execution, `numerator` is the product of (total_days - k) to (total_days - 1), `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
