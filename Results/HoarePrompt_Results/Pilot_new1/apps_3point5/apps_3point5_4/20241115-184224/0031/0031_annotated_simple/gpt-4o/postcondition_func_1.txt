The function func_2 accepts two parameters n and k, both integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates the values of p_shared, A, and B based on the values of numerator and denominator. It then calls func_1 with A and B as parameters, performs some calculations, and prints the final results after applying modulo operations.
