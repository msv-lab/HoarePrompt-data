Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, but the initial state of `p_total` is not given. Therefore, the output state is: numerator is the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, denominator is the product of all total_days modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, p_no_shared is either 1 or the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, p_shared is assigned the value of A, and B is assigned the value of p_total.
Output State: **numerator is the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, denominator is the product of all total_days modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, p_no_shared is either 1 or the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, p_shared is assigned the value of A, and B is assigned the value of p_total**
