Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the total days in Udayland as 2 raised to the power of `n`.
- It then iterates `k` times to update the `numerator` and `denominator` values accordingly.
- After the loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, divides both by this value, and returns the remainders of the division of `numerator` and `denominator` by (10^6 + 3).
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints agree with the code. No edge cases are identified where the code does not work as expected.
