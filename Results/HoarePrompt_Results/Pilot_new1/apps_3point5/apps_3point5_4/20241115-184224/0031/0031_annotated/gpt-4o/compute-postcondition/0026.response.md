Output State: **After the loop executes, `MOD` remains 1000003, `total_days` remains 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` contains the product of all `(total_days - i)` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` contains the product of all `total_days` modulo `MOD`, `i` is the last value of the loop, `k` is greater than 0, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `A` and `B`, `A` is divided in-place by `g`, `B` is divided in-place by `g**
