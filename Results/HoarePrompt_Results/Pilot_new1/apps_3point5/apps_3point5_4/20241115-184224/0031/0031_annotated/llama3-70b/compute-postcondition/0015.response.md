Output State: If k is greater than or equal to 0, gcd is the greatest common divisor of the product of (total_days - 1) times (total_days - 2) times ... times (total_days - k) and the product of total_days times (total_days - 1) times ... times (total_days - k), and numerator is divided by gcd. If k is less than 0, gcd is the greatest common divisor of 1 and 1, and numerator is divided by gcd.
