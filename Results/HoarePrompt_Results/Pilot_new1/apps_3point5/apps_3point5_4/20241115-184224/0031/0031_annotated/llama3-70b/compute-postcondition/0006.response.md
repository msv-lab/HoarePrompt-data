According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated by multiplying the previous value of `numerator` with (`total_days` - `i`), `denominator` is updated by multiplying the previous value of `denominator` with `total_days`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `i` needs to be adjusted to 1 as it is less than `k`.
State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated by multiplying the previous value of `numerator` with (`total_days` - 1), `denominator` is updated by multiplying the previous value of `denominator` with `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
