According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, and `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` modulo `MOD`**
