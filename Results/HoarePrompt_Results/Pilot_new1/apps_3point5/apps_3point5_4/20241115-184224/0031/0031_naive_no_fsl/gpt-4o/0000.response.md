Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days and k people being interviewed.
2. The program uses the provided formula to calculate the probability as an irreducible fraction A/B and prints the values modulo 10^6 + 3.
3. The program handles the edge case where k is greater than 2^n by printing 1 1, as it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday.
4. The program uses a gcd function to find the greatest common divisor and ensures that A and B are coprime before printing the final result.
5. The program correctly handles large inputs within the specified constraints.
