Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. It does this by simply calculating the absolute difference between x and y, which represents the number of seconds needed to reduce the side length from x to y. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
