Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2). Since x and y are integers where 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, the result will always be 1 because the difference between x and y will always be an odd number. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, and the result of the expression is always 1.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, and the result of the expression is always 1**
