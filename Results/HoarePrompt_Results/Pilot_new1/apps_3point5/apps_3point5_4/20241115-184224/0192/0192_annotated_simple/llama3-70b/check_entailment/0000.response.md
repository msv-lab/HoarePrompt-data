Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which represents the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y. This logic is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. The program handles the calculation of the minimum number of seconds required accurately.
