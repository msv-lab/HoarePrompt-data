Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `n`. If `n` is 2 or 3, the function returns `n` itself. If `n` is equal to 4, the function returns 4. For all other values of `n` that are greater than or equal to 2 but not equal to 2, 3, or 4, the function returns 0.***
