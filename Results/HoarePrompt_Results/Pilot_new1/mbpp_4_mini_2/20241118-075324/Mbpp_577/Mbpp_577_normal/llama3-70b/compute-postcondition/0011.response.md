Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is 2 or 3, the function returns `n`. If `n` is equal to 4, the function returns 4. For all other values of `n` that are greater than or equal to 2 but not equal to 3 (i.e., `n` can be 2, 4, or any integer greater than 4), the function returns 0.***
