Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to find the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n`. However, it does not correctly implement the logic needed to achieve this. 

Here are the issues with the program:

1. The program only considers specific cases for `n < 2`, `n == 2`, `n == 3`, and `n == 4`. For any `n` greater than 4, it incorrectly returns `0`, which is not the correct last digit of the factorial for those numbers. For example:
   - For `n = 5`, the factorial is `5! = 120`, and the last digit is `0`.
   - For `n = 6`, the factorial is `6! = 720`, and the last digit is `0`.
   - For `n = 7`, the factorial is `7! = 5040`, and the last digit is `0`.
   - For `n = 10`, the factorial is `10! = 3628800`, and the last digit is `0`.

2. The program does not handle the cases for `n >= 5` correctly, as it does not compute the last digit of the factorial for these values. It simply returns `0` for all `n > 4`, which is incorrect.

3. Additionally, the program does not account for negative integers, which should ideally be handled, even if the factorial is not defined for them in the traditional sense.

Overall, the program fails to provide the correct last digit of the factorial for many valid inputs, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
