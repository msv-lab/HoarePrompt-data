Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of that factorial (i.e., `factorial % 10`). However, the implementation for calculating the factorial is missing, which means that if `n` is less than 5, the function will not return the correct last digit of the factorial. Instead, it will raise an error due to the uninitialized `factorial` variable. **
