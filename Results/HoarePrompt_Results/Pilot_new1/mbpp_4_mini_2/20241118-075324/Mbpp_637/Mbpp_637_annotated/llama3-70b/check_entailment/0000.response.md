Correctness: **True**

The provided program, `func_1`, checks whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price` and returns a boolean value accordingly. The problem description states that the function should determine if there is "no profit and no loss", which is accurately represented by the condition `cost_price == selling_price`. 

The annotations confirm that the function simply compares the two values and returns `True` if they are equal, which aligns perfectly with the requirement of having no profit (selling price greater than cost price) and no loss (selling price less than cost price). 

Since the function directly addresses the problem description without missing any edge cases or additional logic, and there are no examples provided that would indicate a failure in this logic, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential inputs.
