To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description, which asks for a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the volume.

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi \times r^2 \times h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

Now let's evaluate the provided program:

```python
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```

1. **Correctness of the formula**: The program uses the correct formula to calculate the volume of a cylinder.
2. **Input types**: The function does not explicitly check the types of `radius` and `height`. If either of these values is negative, the volume would not make sense in the context of a physical cylinder. The problem description does not specify how to handle negative inputs.
3. **Import statement**: The code uses `math.pi`, but it does not include an import statement for the `math` module. This will lead to a `NameError` if the function is called without importing `math`.

Given these points, we can find a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

- If the function is called with negative values for `radius` or `height`, it will return a negative volume, which is not physically meaningful.
- Additionally, if the function is called without importing the `math` module, it will raise an error.

Since there are cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
