Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle cases where the radius or height is negative. The volume of a cylinder cannot be negative, and the function should ideally check for such invalid inputs. For example, if we call `func_1(-1, 5)` or `func_1(10, -5)`, the function will still compute a volume using the negative value, which is not meaningful in the context of calculating the volume of a cylinder. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect as it does not account for negative inputs.
