Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, the function should accept the radius and height of a cylinder and return the volume, which is valid only for non-negative real numbers. However, the program does not handle cases where either `radius` or `height` are negative.

The annotations state that the function returns the volume calculated as \( \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \), which is accurate, but they fail to mention the requirement that both `radius` and `height` must be non-negative. This omission is significant because if a negative value is passed (e.g., `func_1(-1, 5)`), the function will still execute and return a volume, which is mathematically incorrect for a physical cylinder.

Thus, since the program does not account for negative inputs and could return an invalid volume in such cases, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
