The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are positive real numbers. After executing the function body, it returns a positive real number calculated for the volume based on the provided `radius` and `height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the calculated volume based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both positive real numbers, and returns the calculated volume based on these inputs.**
