The variable `volume` is assigned the value of the expression `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. Since `radius` and `height` are positive real numbers, the calculation will yield a positive real number for `volume`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `radius` is a positive real number, `height` is a positive real number, and `volume` is a positive real number calculated from the formula.

Output State: **`radius` is a positive real number, `height` is a positive real number, and `volume` is a positive real number calculated from the formula.**
