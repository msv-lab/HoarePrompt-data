Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative real number parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume of a cylinder using the formula `volume = Ï€ * radius^2 * height`. There are no checks for negative values or invalid inputs, which could lead to incorrect results if negative values are passed.**
