Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are expected to be non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume of a cylinder calculated as π * radius² * height. However, the function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` is negative, which could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior. There are also no checks for the validity of the input types, which could result in a runtime error if non-numeric values are provided. **
