To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

The problem description states that we need to write a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the volume. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is given by:

\[ \text{Volume} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \]

Now, let's look at the provided program:

```python
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cylinder calculated as π * radius² * height
```

### Analysis:

1. **Correctness of the formula**: The formula used in the program matches the mathematical formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is correct.

2. **Input Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases such as:
   - Negative values for radius or height. In the context of a physical cylinder, negative dimensions do not make sense.
   - Zero values for radius or height. While mathematically the volume would be zero, it might not be meaningful in a practical sense.

3. **Missing Import**: The program uses `math.pi` but does not import the `math` module, which will lead to a `NameError` when the function is called unless the module is imported.

### Conclusion:

Since the program does not handle negative or zero values appropriately and lacks the necessary import statement, we can conclude that there are cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
