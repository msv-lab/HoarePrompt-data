Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst, tup)` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list. 

This implementation will work for all potential cases, including:
- An empty list and a non-empty tuple.
- A non-empty list and an empty tuple.
- Both the list and tuple being empty.

No edge cases or potential inputs have been identified that would cause the function to fail to meet the problem description, thus confirming its correctness.
