Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle edge cases where `lst` or `tup` could be `None`. According to the problem description, the function should add a tuple to a list. However, if either `lst` or `tup` is `None`, the operation `lst + list(tup)` will raise a `TypeError`. 

The annotations mention that the function does not handle edge cases such as `lst` being `None` or `tup` being `None`, which directly influences the reasoning that the program is incorrect. This means that there are potential cases where the program will not work as expected, specifically when `None` values are passed as arguments.

For example:
- If `lst` is `None` and `tup` is `(1, 2)`, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
- If `lst` is `[]` and `tup` is `None`, the function will also raise a `TypeError`.

Since the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, it is considered incorrect.
