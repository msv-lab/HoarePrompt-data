The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. `lst` is a list, and `tpl` is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns a new list that is formed by concatenating `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl`, which are converted to a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that combines the elements of both. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a tuple tpl, and returns a new list formed by concatenating lst with the elements of tpl converted to a list.**
