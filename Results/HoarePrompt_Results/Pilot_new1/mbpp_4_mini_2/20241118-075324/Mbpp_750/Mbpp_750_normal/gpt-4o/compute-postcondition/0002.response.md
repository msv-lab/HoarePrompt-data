Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is formed by concatenating `lst` with the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. It does not handle cases where `lst` is not a list or `tpl` is not a tuple, but assumes they are valid inputs as per the function's design. **
