The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned `False`, and `j` is 4. Therefore, `is_prime[4]` is set to `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (greater than 4) and `is_prime` (with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, and `is_prime[i]` as True for `i` equal to 2). The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 4; `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False; `j` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4; `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False; `j` is 4**
