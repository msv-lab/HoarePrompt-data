To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the current state and the loop structure.

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(i * i, n, i):`. This means that the loop will start at `i * i`, which is `3 * 3 = 9`, and will continue until `j` reaches `n`, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 3) on each iteration.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is at least 12.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is currently 15.

3. **Next Iteration Conditions**: 
   - The loop will execute again if `j` (the next value of `j`) is less than `n`. 
   - The next value of `j` will be `15 + 3 = 18`.

4. **Adjustment of States**:
   - Since `j` is currently 15, and the next value will be 18, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 18 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 18.

5. **Final State**: 
   - We keep `is_prime` unchanged because the loop does not modify the list in this context, and we only adjust `n`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments lead to the following state:

State: **`n` is greater than 18, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, `is_prime[15]` is False, `i` is 3, `j` is 18**
