The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned to `False`. Since `j` is 9, this means that `is_prime[9]` is set to `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, and `is_prime[9]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is at least 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, and `is_prime[9]` is set to False**
