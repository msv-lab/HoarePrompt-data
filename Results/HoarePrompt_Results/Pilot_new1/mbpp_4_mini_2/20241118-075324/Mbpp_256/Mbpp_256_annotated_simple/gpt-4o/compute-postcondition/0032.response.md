The code assigns `False` to the index `j` of the list `is_prime`. The value of `j` is 24, so `is_prime[24]` is now set to `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, and since `is_prime[24]` was not previously mentioned, we can assume it was either `True` or `False`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 24, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[16]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, and `is_prime[20]` is set to False, and `is_prime[24]` is now False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 24, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[16]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime[20]` is set to False, and `is_prime[24]` is now False**.
