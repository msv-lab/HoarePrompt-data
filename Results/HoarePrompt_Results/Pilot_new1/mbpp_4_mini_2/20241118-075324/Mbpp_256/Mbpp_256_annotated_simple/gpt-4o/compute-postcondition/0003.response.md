The code initializes a list `is_prime` with `True` values, with a length equal to `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function would have returned 0, but since we are only initializing the list now, we need to consider the value of `n`. 

If `n` is 0, then `is_prime` would be an empty list. If `n` is 1, it would also be an empty list. If `n` is 2, `is_prime` would contain one element, which is `[True]`. If `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` would contain `n` elements, all set to `True`.

Since the output state needs to reflect the initialization of `is_prime`, the output can be summarized based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` initialized to all True values.**
