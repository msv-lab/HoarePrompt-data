According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 16 and `n` is at least 17. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to calculate the next value of `j`, which will be `j + i`. Since `i` is 4, the next value of `j` will be 16 + 4 = 20. 

Now, we need to check if this new value of `j` (which is 20) is less than `n`. Given that `n` is at least 17, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 20.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to 20.
- `n` should be updated to be greater than 20.

State: **`n` is greater than 20, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[16]` is set to False**
