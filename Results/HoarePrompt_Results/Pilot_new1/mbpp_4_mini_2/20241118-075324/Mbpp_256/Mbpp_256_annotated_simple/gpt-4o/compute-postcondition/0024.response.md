The loop is designed to mark multiples of `i` (which is 3) as not prime in the `is_prime` list, starting from `i * i` (which is 9) and continuing up to `n`. The loop increments `j` by `i` each iteration.

If `n` is at least 9, the loop will execute at least once, marking `is_prime[9]` as False. Subsequent iterations will continue to mark other multiples of 3 as False, specifically `is_prime[12]`, `is_prime[15]`, and so on, until `j` reaches `n`.

If `n` is less than 9, the loop will not execute at all, and the values of `is_prime` will remain unchanged except for the initial conditions.

Output State: **If n is at least 9, `is_prime` will have `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, and all multiples of 3 from 9 up to but not including n marked as False. If n is less than 9, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False.**
