The code sets `is_prime[j]` to False. Since `j` is `4 + 2i`, the previous value of `is_prime[j]` is set to False as per the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `4 + 2i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `j` is `4 + 2i`, and `is_prime[j]` is False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `4 + 2i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `j` is `4 + 2i`, and `is_prime[j]` is False**
