According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the starting value `i * i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is 4, `i * i` equals 16. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 16. 

Given that `n` is at least 9, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than 16. Therefore, we can set `n` to be at least 17. 

Additionally, `j` will start at `i * i`, which is 16, and will increment by `i` (which is 4) until it reaches `n`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 17, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 4, `j` is 16**
