According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than `j + i`, which implies that `j` is less than `n`. 

The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i * i` and increments `j` by `i` in each iteration. Since `j` is currently `4 + i`, we need to ensure that `j` is adjusted to allow for another iteration.

To prepare for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by `i`. Thus, the new value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `4 + i + i` or `4 + 2i`. 

Since `n` is already greater than `j + i`, we do not need to change the state of `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than `4 + 2i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `j` is `4 + 2i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
