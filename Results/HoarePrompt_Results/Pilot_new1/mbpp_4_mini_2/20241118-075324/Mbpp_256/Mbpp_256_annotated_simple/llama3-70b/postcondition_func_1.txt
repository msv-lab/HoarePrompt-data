The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 (including 0 and 1). If `num` is 2 or greater, it checks for divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If any such integer divides `num` evenly, it returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not prime. If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
