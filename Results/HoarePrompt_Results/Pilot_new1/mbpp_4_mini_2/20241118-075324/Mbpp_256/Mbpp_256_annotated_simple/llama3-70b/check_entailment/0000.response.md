To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and the annotations.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a non-negative number and return the count of prime numbers less than that number.

### Annotated Program:
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - Initializes a count to 0.
   - Iterates through numbers from 2 to `n-1`.
   - Increments the count for each prime number found using the `is_prime` function.
   - Returns the count.

2. **Function `is_prime(num)`**:
   - Returns False if `num` is less than 2.
   - If `num` is 2 or greater, it checks for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`.
   - Returns True if `num` is prime.

### Analysis:
- The main function `func_1` correctly handles the case when `n` is less than 2, as it will return 0 (since no primes exist below 2).
- For `n = 2`, the loop does not execute, and it also correctly returns 0.
- For `n > 2`, the function counts the primes correctly by checking each number up to `n-1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case `n = 0`**: The function will return 0, which is correct because there are no prime numbers less than 0.
- **Case `n = 1`**: The function will return 0, which is correct because there are no prime numbers less than 1.
- **Case `n = 2`**: The function will return 0, which is correct because there are no prime numbers less than 2.
- **Case `n = 3`**: The function will return 1, which is correct because the only prime number less than 3 is 2.
- **Case `n = 4`**: The function will return 2, which is correct because the prime numbers less than 4 are 2 and 3.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all potential edge cases correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, there are no examples where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
