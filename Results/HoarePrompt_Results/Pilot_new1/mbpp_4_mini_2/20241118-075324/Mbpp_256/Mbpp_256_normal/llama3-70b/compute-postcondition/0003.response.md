According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop is designed to execute when `num` is 2 or greater, as it starts iterating from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False, and the loop will not execute. 

To ensure the loop can execute, `num` must be at least 2. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 2, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2**
