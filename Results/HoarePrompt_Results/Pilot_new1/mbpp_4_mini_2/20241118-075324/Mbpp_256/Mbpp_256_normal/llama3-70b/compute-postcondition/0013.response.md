According to the code, the loop iterates over a range that starts at 2 and ends at `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop variable `i` is currently 4, which means that the last value of `i` used in the loop was 4. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the upper limit of the range, which is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. 

Given that `num` is greater than or equal to 4, we can deduce the following:
- If `num` is exactly 16, then `int(num ** 0.5)` is 4, making the upper limit `5`. In this case, the loop could execute one more time with `i` being 5.
- If `num` is greater than 16, `int(num ** 0.5)` would be greater than 4, allowing `i` to be incremented to values greater than 4.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be greater than or equal to 16 to allow `i` to be incremented to 5, and `i` will be incremented to 5.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 5**
