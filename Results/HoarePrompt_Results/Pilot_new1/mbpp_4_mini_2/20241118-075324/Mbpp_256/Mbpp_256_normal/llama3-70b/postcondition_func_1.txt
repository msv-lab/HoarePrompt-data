The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns False if `num` is less than 2 (including 0 and 1). If `num` is 2 or greater, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If it finds such a divisor, it returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number. The function does not handle negative integers, which may lead to unexpected behavior if such values are passed.
