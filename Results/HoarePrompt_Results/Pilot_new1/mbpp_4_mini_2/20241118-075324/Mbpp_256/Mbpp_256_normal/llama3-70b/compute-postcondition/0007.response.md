According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 2 up to `int(num ** 0.5)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `num` is 2 or greater. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition for the next value of `i`, which would be 3.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. Thus, we need to ensure that `num` is such that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

If `num` is 2, then `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` equals 2, which means the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be greater than 2, making `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` at least 3.

Thus, `num` must be adjusted to be greater than 2, and `i` should be updated to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`num` is greater than 2, `i` is 3**
