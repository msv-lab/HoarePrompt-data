Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the function returns False. If `num` is 0 or 1, the loop does not execute and the function returns False. If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any `i`, the loop completes without returning, indicating that `num` is a prime number. After the loop, if it executed, `i` will be equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.**
