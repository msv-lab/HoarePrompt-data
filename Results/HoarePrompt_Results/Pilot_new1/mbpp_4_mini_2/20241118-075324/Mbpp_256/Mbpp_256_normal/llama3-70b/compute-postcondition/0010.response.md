According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `num`. The loop iterates with `i` starting from 2 up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `num` is greater than 2. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` can be incremented. Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Additionally, we need to ensure that `num` is still greater than or equal to `4` (since `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing).

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be 4.
- `num` should be greater than or equal to 4 (which is implied since `num` is greater than 2).

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4**
