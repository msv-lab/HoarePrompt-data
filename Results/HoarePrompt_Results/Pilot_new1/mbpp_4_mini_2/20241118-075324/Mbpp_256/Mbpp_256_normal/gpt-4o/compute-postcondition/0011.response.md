According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 6, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 6. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value calculated by `j = j + i`, which means `j` should become 8 (6 + 2).

Since `n` is greater than 6, it will still hold true that `j` is less than `n` after the adjustment. Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `j` and the corresponding value of `is_prime[j]`, which is now `is_prime[8]` (though we don't have information about its value).

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 8, `is_prime[4]` is now False, `is_prime[6]` is now False, `is_prime[8]` is unknown**
