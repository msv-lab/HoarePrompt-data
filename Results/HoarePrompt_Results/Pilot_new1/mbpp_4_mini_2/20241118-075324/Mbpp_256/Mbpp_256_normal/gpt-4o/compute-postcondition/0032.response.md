The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`. Since `j` is 24, `is_prime[24]` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `is_prime[16]`, `is_prime[20]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 24, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime[16]` is set to False, `is_prime[20]` is set to False, and `is_prime[24]` is now set to False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 24, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime[16]` is set to False, `is_prime[20]` is set to False, `is_prime[24]` is set to False**
