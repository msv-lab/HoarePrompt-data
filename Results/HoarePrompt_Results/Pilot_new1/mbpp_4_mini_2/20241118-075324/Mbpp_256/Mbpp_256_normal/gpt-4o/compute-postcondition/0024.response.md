Output State: **`is_prime[j]` is set to `False` for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to but not including `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 9, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is exactly 9, the loop executes only once and sets `is_prime[9]` to `False`. If `n` is less than 9, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged.**
