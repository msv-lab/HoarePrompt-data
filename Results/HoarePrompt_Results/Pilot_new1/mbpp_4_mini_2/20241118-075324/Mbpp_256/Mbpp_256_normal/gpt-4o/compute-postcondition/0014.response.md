Output State: **`is_prime[j]` is set to False for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to but not including `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for those indices. In the case where `i` is 2, the loop will execute for `j` values of 4, 6, 8, etc., marking them as not prime until `j` reaches or exceeds `n`.**
