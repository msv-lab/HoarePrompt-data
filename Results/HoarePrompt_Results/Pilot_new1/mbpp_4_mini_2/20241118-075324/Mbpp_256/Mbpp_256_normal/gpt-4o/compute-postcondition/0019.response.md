According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 9, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 9. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to calculate the next value of `j`, which is `j + i`. Since `j` is currently 9 and `i` is 3, the next value of `j` will be `9 + 3 = 12`. 

Now we need to ensure that this new value of `j` is still less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Given that `n` is greater than 9, it must also be greater than 12 for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` is now 12 and that `n` must be greater than 12.

State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and `is_prime[9]` is set to `False`**
