Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 9 and `i` is 4. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` (which is 16) up to but not including `n`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False. If `n` is less than or equal to 16, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 16, then `is_prime` will have all multiples of `i` (i.e., 16, 20, 24, ...) marked as False up to the largest multiple of `i` that is less than `n`.***
