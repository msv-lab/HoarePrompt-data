According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 9. 

To determine if the loop will execute again, we need to calculate `int(n ** 0.5)`. Since `n` is greater than 9, we can infer that `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 3 (the square root of 9). However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

For `i` to continue iterating, we need to check if `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 4. If `n` is greater than or equal to 16, then `int(n ** 0.5)` would be at least 4 (since the square root of 16 is 4). 

Thus, in order for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure:
1. `n` must be at least 16 (to ensure `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 4).
2. `i` will increment to 5 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 5**
