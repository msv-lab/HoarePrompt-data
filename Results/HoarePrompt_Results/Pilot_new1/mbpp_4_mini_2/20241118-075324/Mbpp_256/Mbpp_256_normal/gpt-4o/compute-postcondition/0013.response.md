According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is greater than 6,
- `i` is 2,
- `j` is 8.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 8 and `n` is greater than 6, we need to ensure that `j` is updated accordingly. The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `8 + 2 = 10`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to 10, and it must be ensured that `n` is greater than 10. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 10, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 10, `is_prime[4]` is now False, `is_prime[6]` is now False, and `is_prime[8]` is now False**
