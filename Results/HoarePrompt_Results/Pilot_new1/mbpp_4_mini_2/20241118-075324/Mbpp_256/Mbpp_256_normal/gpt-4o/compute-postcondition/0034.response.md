Output State: **`is_prime[j]` is set to False for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to but not including `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than `i * i`, then `j` will take values in the sequence `16, 20, 24, ...` until it reaches the first multiple of `i` that is greater than or equal to `n`.**
