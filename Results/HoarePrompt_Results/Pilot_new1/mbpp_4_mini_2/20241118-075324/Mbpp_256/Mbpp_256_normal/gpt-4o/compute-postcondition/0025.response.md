Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 9 and `i` is 3. If `is_prime[i]` is True, all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to but not including `n` are set to False in the `is_prime` array. If `n` is exactly 9, `is_prime[9]` is set to False. If `n` is greater than 9, the loop sets `is_prime[j]` to False for all multiples of 3 from 9 up to but not including `n`. If `is_prime[i]` is False, the `is_prime` array remains unchanged.***
