Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to but not including `n`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False for those indices. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for those indices. In the specific case where `i` is 2, the loop will mark even numbers starting from 4 as not prime until `j` reaches or exceeds `n`.***
