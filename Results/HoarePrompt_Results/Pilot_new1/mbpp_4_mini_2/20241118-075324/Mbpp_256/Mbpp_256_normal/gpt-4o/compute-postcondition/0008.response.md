The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`, and since `j` is 4, this means that `is_prime[4]` is now `False`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `is_prime[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 4, and `is_prime[4]` is now False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 4, and `is_prime[4]` is now False**
