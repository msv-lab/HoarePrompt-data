To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop and the current state.

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(i * i, n, i):
```

This loop will iterate starting from `i * i` and will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`, incrementing `j` by `i` in each iteration.

Given the current state:
- `n` is greater than 4
- `i` is 2
- `is_prime[i]` is true (indicating that 2 is a prime number)
- `j` is 4
- `is_prime[4]` is now False (indicating that 4 is not a prime number)

Now, let's analyze the loop conditions:
1. The starting point of the loop is `i * i`, which is `2 * 2 = 4`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.
3. The current value of `j` is 4.

Since `j` is currently 4, the next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which means `j` will become 4 + 2 = 6 in the next iteration. 

We need to ensure that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 4, we can deduce that `n` must be adjusted to ensure that `j` can be less than `n`. Specifically, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 6.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 6, and `is_prime[4]` is now False**
