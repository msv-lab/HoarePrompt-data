According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. The loop starts with `j` equal to 16 and increments `j` by `i` (which is 4) in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 17, `i` is 4, and `j` is 16. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value, which is `j + i`. Therefore, `j` will become 20 (16 + 4).

Now we need to check if this new value of `j` (which is 20) is still less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 17, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 20.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 20, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[16]` is set to False**
