According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `n` and `i`. The loop will execute if the starting value `i * i` is less than `n`, as the range function will generate numbers starting from `i * i` up to (but not including) `n`, incrementing by `i`. 

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2, the starting point for `j` would be `2 * 2 = 4`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 4. 

Since `is_prime[i]` is true, it indicates that `i` (which is 2) is a prime number, but this does not affect the execution of the loop directly.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 4 and that `j` starts at 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 4**
