According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. We need to ensure that `3` is still less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. This means that `n` must be at least `3 * 3 = 9` for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be incremented to 3.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 9.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3**
