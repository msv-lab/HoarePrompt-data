You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is exactly 2, then `count` is 0. If `n` is greater than 2, then `count` is the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n-1`.
    return count
    #The program returns 0 if n is 2, otherwise it returns the number of prime numbers between 2 and n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts an integer `n` and counts the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n-1`. It returns 0 if `n` is 2, and for any value of `n` greater than 2, it returns the count of prime numbers in that range. If `n` is less than 2, the function does not explicitly handle this case, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#Function 2:
def is_prime(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`num` is a non-negative integer. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is 2 or greater, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None).
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the function returns False. If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop checks for divisibility of `num` by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any of these integers, the loop completes without returning, and the function implicitly returns None. Therefore, after the loop, if it executes, `i` will be the last integer checked, which is `int(num
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that 'num' is a prime number.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if `num` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. It returns `True` if `num` is a prime number. If `num` is 2 or greater and not divisible by any integers in that range, it will return `True`, but if `num` is less than 2, it will return `False`. The function does not explicitly handle the case where `num` is exactly 2, but it will return `True` correctly since 2 is a prime number.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
