According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `num` is an integer greater than 2. 

To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition for the loop: `i` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. Since `num` is greater than 2, the value of `int(num ** 0.5)` will be at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to 4. However, we also need to ensure that `num` is such that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 4, which means `num` must be at least 16 (since `sqrt(16) = 4`).

Thus, the adjusted states should reflect that `num` is at least 16, and `i` is now 4.

State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4**
