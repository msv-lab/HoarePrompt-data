The function accepts an integer `n` and counts the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n-1`. It returns 0 if `n` is 2, and for any value of `n` greater than 2, it returns the count of prime numbers in that range. If `n` is less than 2, the function does not explicitly handle this case, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
