According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is at least 2, we need to ensure that `i` has a value such that `i * i < n`. 

Since `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, it implies that `i` must be a prime number within that range. 

For the loop to execute:
1. `i` must be defined and a prime number.
2. `i * i` must be less than `n`.

Since `is_prime[2]` is True, we can set `i` to 2, which gives us `i * i = 4`. For the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 4.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `i` is 2 (the first prime number).
- `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `i` is 2**
