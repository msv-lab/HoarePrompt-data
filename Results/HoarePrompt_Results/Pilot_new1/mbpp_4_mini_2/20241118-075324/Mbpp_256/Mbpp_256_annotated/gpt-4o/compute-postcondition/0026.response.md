According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to the upper limit of the loop, which is `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `int(n)`, which means it has reached or exceeded the square root limit for the next iteration. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `int(n ** 0.5)` will be less than or equal to `n`, and thus `i` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `int(n ** 0.5)`, and the upper limit of the loop remains the same. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `i` is equal to int(n ** 0.5)`**
