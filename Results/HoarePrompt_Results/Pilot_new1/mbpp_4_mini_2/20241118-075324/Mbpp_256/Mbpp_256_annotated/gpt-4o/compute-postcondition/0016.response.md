According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop is designed to iterate from `2` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `2`, and `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. Since the loop increments `i` with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to the next integer value.

1. If `i` was the last value of the previous iteration, it must be incremented by 1 to allow the loop to execute again.
2. We also need to ensure that `i` is still within the bounds of `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we can assume that `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`, it needs to be incremented to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `i` is equal to int(n ** 0.5) + 1**
