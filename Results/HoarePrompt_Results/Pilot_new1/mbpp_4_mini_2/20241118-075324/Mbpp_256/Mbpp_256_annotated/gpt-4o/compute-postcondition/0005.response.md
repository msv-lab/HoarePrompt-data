According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to execute for values of `i` starting from `2` up to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `2`, as the range would be `range(2, 2)` if `n` is `1`, which means the loop would not execute at all. 

Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to `2`, as that is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1, i` is 2**
