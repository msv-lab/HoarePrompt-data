Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False, where `j` takes values in the form of `i * i + k * i` for non-negative integers `k`. If `i` is greater than or equal to sqrt(n), the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices `j` in the range. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged.***
