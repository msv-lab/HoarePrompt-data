According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop iterates from `i * i` to `n` in steps of `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is greater than 4
- `i` is 2
- Therefore, `i * i` is 4.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` starts at `i * i` (which is 4) and increments by `i` (which is 2), the next value of `j` would be 6 (4 + 2). 

To ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must be greater than 6. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `n` needs to be greater than 6.
- `j` needs to be set to 4 for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False for an unspecified `j`.**
