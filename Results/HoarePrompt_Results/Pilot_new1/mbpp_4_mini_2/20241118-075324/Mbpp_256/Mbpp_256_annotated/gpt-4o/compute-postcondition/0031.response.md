According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False for `j = i * i + i`. Therefore, the value of `j` at the end of the last iteration would be `i * i + i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` is now `i * i + i` and must be less than `n`. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we do not need to change `n`, but we do need to set `j` to `i * i + i` for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i * i + i`**
