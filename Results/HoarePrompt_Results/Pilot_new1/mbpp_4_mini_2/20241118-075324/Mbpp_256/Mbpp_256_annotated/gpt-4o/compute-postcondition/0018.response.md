The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`, indicating that the number `j` is not a prime number. The variable `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that `j` is a value in the range from `2` to `n-1`. Therefore, the state of `is_prime` changes for the specific index `j`, while the other variables remain unaffected. The output state reflects the change in the `is_prime` array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2; `is_prime[j]` is False for a specific index `j`, and `i` is less than sqrt(n)**
