Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, and `i` is equal to int(n). If `is_prime[i]` is True, then for all indices `j` that are multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False. If `i` is greater than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices in that range.***
