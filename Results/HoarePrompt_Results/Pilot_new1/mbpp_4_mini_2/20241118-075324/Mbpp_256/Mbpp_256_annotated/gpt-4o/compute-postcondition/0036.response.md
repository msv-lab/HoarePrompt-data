According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Since the loop iterates from `2` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, if we assume the last value of `i` was `int(n ** 0.5)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be such that `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` is still less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`. This implies that `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` can take on the value `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, as `sqrt(3)` is approximately 1.73, and `int(1.73) + 1` equals 2, which allows for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`.**
