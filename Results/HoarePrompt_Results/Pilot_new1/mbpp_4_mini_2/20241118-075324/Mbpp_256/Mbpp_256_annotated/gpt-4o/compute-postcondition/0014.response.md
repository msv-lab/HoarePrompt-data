Output State: **`is_prime[j]` is set to False for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, where `j` is a multiple of `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices from `2` to `n-1`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged.**
