The code assigns the value `False` to `is_prime[j]`. Given the initial state, we know that `is_prime[j]` was previously `False`, and the assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated index `j + i`, `j` is less than `n`, and `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated index `j + i`, `j` is less than `n`, and `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`**.
