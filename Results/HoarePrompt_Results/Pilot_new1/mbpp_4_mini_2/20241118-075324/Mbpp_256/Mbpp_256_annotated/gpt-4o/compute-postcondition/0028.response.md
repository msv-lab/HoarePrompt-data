The code sets `is_prime[j]` to `False`. The value of `j` is defined as `i * i`, where `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`. Since `is_prime[i]` is `True` for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, the assignment will mark the index `j` in the `is_prime` list as `False`, indicating that `j` is not a prime number. The values of `n`, `is_prime`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `i` is less than sqrt(n), and `is_prime[j]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `i` is less than sqrt(n), and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
