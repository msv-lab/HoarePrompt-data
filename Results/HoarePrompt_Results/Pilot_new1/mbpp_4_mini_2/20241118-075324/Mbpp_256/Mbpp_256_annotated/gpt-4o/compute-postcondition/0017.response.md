According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range starting from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. 

To ensure the loop executes, the starting point `i * i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is at least 2 and `i` is equal to `n`, we can deduce that `i * i` will be greater than or equal to `n` when `i` is equal to or greater than the square root of `n`. 

Since `i` is equal to `n`, `i * i` will equal `n * n`, which is certainly greater than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `sqrt(n)` or `n` must be adjusted to be greater than `i * i`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` must be less than `sqrt(n)` to allow `i * i` to be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `i` is less than sqrt(n)**
