The code initializes a list `is_prime` with `n` elements, all set to `True`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function would have returned 0, but since the code snippet provided does not include a return statement, we will consider the case where `n` is greater than 2. In this case, `is_prime` will be a list with `n` elements, all set to `True`. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `True`**
