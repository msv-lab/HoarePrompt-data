Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to check if a given tuple contains any `None` values. However, the implementation is incorrect because it returns `True` when there is at least one `None` value in the tuple, which does not align with the problem description that asks to check if the tuple has any `None` value or not.

The function `func_1` is using `any()` to return `True` when it finds a `None` value, which means that it indicates the presence of a `None` value instead of confirming its absence. The problem description implies that the function should return `True` if there are no `None` values in the tuple and `False` if there are any.

For example:
- Input: `(1, 2, 3)` should return `True` (no `None` values).
- Input: `(1, None, 3)` should return `False` (contains a `None` value).

Since the function does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description for all potential cases, it is incorrect.
