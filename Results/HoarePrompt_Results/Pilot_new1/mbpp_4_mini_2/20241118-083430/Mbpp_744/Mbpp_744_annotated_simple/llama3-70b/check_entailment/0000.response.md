Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to check if a given tuple contains any `None` values. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` is incorrect based on the problem description. The function uses `any(x is None for x in tup)`, which returns `True` if any element in the tuple is `None`, and `False` otherwise. 

The problem description asks to check if the tuple has any `None` value, which implies that the function should return `True` if there is at least one `None` value and `False` if there are none. The function currently does this correctly, but the annotation suggests that it returns `True` when it finds a `None`, which is not the expected output based on the problem description. 

Additionally, the function does not explicitly handle the case of an empty tuple. Although `any()` will return `False` for an empty iterable, the problem description does not clarify how the function should behave in this case. Therefore, we can consider the function to be incomplete or not fully aligned with the problem description.

For example, when we pass an empty tuple `()` to the function, it will return `False`, which might not be the expected behavior since the problem description does not specify how to treat an empty tuple.

Thus, there are potential cases where the program does not behave as expected based on the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
