The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a student's name and each value is a tuple containing two floats (student_height, student_weight). The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight respectively. After executing the function body, the function returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter and return a dictionary of students based on their height and weight compared to the specified minimum values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary student_data of student names and their heights and weights, and two floats min_height and min_weight. It returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
