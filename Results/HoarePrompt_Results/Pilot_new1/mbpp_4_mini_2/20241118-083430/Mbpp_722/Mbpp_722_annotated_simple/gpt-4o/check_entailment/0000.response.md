Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It filters a dictionary of students based on their height and weight compared to the given minimum values. 

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`.
- It uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over each student in `student_dict`.
- For each student, it checks if both the height and weight are greater than or equal to the specified minimum values.
- If both conditions are met, the student's name and their corresponding height and weight are included in the resulting dictionary.

Given the logic implemented in the code, it accurately filters students based on the specified criteria. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail to meet the requirements. For example:

1. If `student_dict` is empty, the function correctly returns an empty dictionary.
2. If all students are below the minimum height and weight, it returns an empty dictionary.
3. If some students meet the criteria and others do not, only the qualifying students are included in the output.

Since the function handles all potential cases as described, the program is correct.
