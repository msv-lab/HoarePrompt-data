The function accepts a dictionary `student_data`, where each key is a student's name and the value is a tuple containing their height and weight. It also accepts two float values, `min_height` and `min_weight`. The function returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with each student's name as the key and their (height, weight) tuple as the value. If no students meet the criteria, it returns an empty dictionary.
