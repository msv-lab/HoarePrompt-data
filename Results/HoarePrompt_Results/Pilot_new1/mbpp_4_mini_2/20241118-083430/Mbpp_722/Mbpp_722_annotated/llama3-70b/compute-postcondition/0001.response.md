The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a student's name, and each value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight. The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are float values representing the minimum height and weight thresholds, respectively. After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with each student's name as the key and their (height, weight) tuple as the value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student data and two float values for minimum height and weight, returning a dictionary of students who meet or exceed the specified height and weight thresholds.**
