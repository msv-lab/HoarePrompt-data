The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a string (representing a student name) and each value is a tuple of two floats (representing the student's height and weight). The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum required height and weight, respectively. After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary of student data along with minimum height and weight requirements, and return a filtered dictionary of students who meet these criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight, returning a dictionary of students whose height and weight meet or exceed the specified minimums.**
