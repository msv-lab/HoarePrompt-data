The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names and values are tuples of two floats representing the student's height and weight. The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats that represent the minimum height and weight thresholds, respectively. After executing the function body, the function returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and whose weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The keys of this returned dictionary are the student names, and the values are their corresponding (height, weight) tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of students with their height and weight, along with minimum height and weight thresholds, and returns a dictionary of students who meet or exceed these thresholds.**
