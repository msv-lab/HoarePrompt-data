Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements, and `i` is `len(lst) - 1`. If the last element of `lst` is greater than the element before it (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), the function returns False. If `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]`, the function does not return anything, implying that the condition is not met and no action is taken.***
