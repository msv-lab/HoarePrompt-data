Output State: **If `lst` is a list with at least 2 elements, the loop checks if each element is greater than the next. If any element `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False. If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and no return occurs, implying that the list is either empty or contains a single element. In such cases, the state of the program remains unchanged, and no comparison is made.**
