To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, let's analyze the function `func_1(lst)`.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. This means that for a list to be considered sorted, each element must be less than or equal to the next element. Empty lists and lists with a single element are considered sorted.

### Annotations:
1. The function returns `True` if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns `False`.
2. The function handles empty lists and lists with a single element by returning `True`, as these are considered sorted by definition.

### Code Analysis:
The code uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to check if every element in the list is less than or equal to the next element:

```python
return all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))
```

- For an empty list (`lst = []`), `len(lst) - 1` becomes `-1`, and the range will be empty. Thus, `all()` will return `True` as there are no elements to violate the condition.
- For a list with a single element (`lst = [x]`), again `len(lst) - 1` is `0`, and the range will be empty, so `all()` will return `True`.
- For lists with multiple elements, the condition `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]` is checked for each pair of adjacent elements.

### Edge Cases:
- An example of a sorted list: `[1, 2, 2, 3]` should return `True`.
- An example of an unsorted list: `[3, 2, 1]` should return `False`.
- An example of a list with negative numbers: `[-3, -2, -1]` should return `True`.
- An example of a list with duplicates: `[1, 1, 1]` should return `True`.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to check if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order and handles edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists appropriately. The annotations confirm that the function is intended to return `True` for sorted lists and handle special cases as described.

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The function is correct because it accurately checks for sorted order in all cases, including edge cases mentioned in the problem description.
