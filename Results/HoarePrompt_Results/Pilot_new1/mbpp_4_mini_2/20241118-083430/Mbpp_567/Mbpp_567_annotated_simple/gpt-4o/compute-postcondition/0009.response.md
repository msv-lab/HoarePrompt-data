Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements. If the last element of `lst` (i.e., `lst[len(lst) - 1]`) is greater than the second last element (i.e., `lst[len(lst) - 2]`), the function returns False. If the last element is less than or equal to the second last element, there is no return value, and the program continues execution.***
