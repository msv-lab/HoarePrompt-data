The function accepts a list `lst` and checks if it is in non-decreasing order. It returns `False` if any element is greater than the next one, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the list is in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. Additionally, if the list has fewer than 2 elements, it does not explicitly return anything, which means it defaults to returning `None`, although it should be considered as trivially sorted.
