Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It uses the `all()` function combined with a generator expression that iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next one. 

The logic implemented in the function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It generates pairs of adjacent elements in the list.
2. It checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
3. If all pairs satisfy this condition, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. If any pair fails the condition, it returns `False`.

The program handles various edge cases:
- An empty list is considered sorted.
- A list with one element is also considered sorted.
- It correctly identifies lists that are sorted in ascending order, as well as lists that contain duplicate elements.

No potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
