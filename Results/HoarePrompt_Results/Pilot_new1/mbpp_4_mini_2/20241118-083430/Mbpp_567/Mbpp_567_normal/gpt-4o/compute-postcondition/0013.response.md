The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. If `lst` has at least 2 elements, the function checks if each element is greater than the next one. If any element is found to be greater than the next one, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order. If all comparisons satisfy the condition (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next), the function completes without returning, which implies an implicit return of `None`. If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the function also implicitly returns `None`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of comparable elements `lst` and return `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; if not, it returns `False`, and if the list has fewer than 2 elements, it implicitly returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, returns True if lst is sorted in non-decreasing order, returns False if lst is not sorted, and implicitly returns None if lst has fewer than 2 elements.**
