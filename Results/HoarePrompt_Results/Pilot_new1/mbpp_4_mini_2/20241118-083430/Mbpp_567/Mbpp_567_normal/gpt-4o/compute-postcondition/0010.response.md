According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, where `k + 1` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. This means that `i` is currently less than `len(lst) - 1`, allowing the loop to execute one more time. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, which means that `i` will now be `k + 2`. Additionally, since `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to `k + 2`.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is `k + 2`**
