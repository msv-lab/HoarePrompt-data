The provided program is designed to check if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The code uses the `all()` function to evaluate whether each element in the list is less than or equal to the next one. 

### Initial Assessment
1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(lst)` iterates through the list `lst` and checks if every element is less than or equal to the next one. This aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should check if the list is sorted.
2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - An empty list should return `True` since there are no elements that violate the sorted order.
   - A list with a single element should also return `True` for the same reason.
   - A list with duplicate elements should return `True` as they do not violate the non-decreasing order.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function returns `True` if all elements are in non-decreasing order and that it handles edge cases such as empty lists returning `True`. 

### Agreement Between Code and Output Hints
The output hints accurately reflect the functionality of the code. The code correctly identifies sorted lists, including edge cases such as empty lists and lists with single or duplicate elements.

### Conclusion
Since the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the output hints agree with the code's behavior for all tested cases, I cannot find any example where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly checks if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order, including handling edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists, which all return `True`.
