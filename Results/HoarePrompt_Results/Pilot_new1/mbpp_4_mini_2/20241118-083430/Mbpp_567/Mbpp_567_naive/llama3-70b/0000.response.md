Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It uses a generator expression with the `all()` function to verify that for every pair of consecutive elements in the list, the previous element is less than or equal to the next element. 

The function handles all potential cases:
1. An empty list is considered sorted.
2. A list with one element is also considered sorted.
3. For lists with multiple elements, it correctly checks the order of all elements.

Since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
