Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it does not account for lists that are empty or contain a single element. 

For example:
- An empty list `[]` should be considered sorted, but the function would not return True for this case.
- A list with a single element `[5]` should also be considered sorted, but again, the function would not return True for this case.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
