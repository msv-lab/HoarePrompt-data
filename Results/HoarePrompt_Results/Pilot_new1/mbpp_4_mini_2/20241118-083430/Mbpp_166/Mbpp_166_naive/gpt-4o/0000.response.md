To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem Description**: Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum((1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0))
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
```

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Understanding XOR and Evenness**:
   - Two integers will XOR to an even number if both are even or both are odd. This is because:
     - Even XOR Even = Even
     - Odd XOR Odd = Even
     - Even XOR Odd = Odd

2. **Counting Pairs**:
   - The code correctly counts the number of even integers (`even_count`) and odd integers (`odd_count`) in the list.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of even integers using the combination formula \( C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2 \).
   - It also calculates the number of pairs of odd integers similarly.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The program returns the total number of pairs that can be formed from both even and odd counts.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the expected output should be `0` since there are no pairs.
- **Single Element List**: If the input list contains only one element, the expected output should also be `0`, as one element cannot form a pair.
- **All Even or All Odd**: The program should handle lists where all elements are even or all elements are odd correctly.

### Testing Edge Cases
- For an empty list `[]`, the function returns `0`, which is correct.
- For a single element list `[1]`, the function also returns `0`, which is correct.
- For a list with all even numbers, say `[2, 4, 6]`, the function calculates pairs correctly as `3` (i.e., pairs are (2,4), (2,6), (4,6)).
- For a list with all odd numbers, say `[1, 3, 5]`, the function calculates pairs correctly as `3` (i.e., pairs are (1,3), (1,5), (3,5)).

### Conclusion
The program seems to handle all the cases correctly as described. It counts pairs of integers that XOR to an even number accurately.

Correctness: **True**.
