According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will iterate from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`. Since `i` is currently 0, the starting point for `j` will be `1`. 

For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`, which translates to `len(nums)` being greater than `1`. Given that `nums` is a list with at least one element, this condition implies that the list must have at least 2 elements for the loop to run.

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `j` will be the last index that is processed in the loop. However, since we are verifying the state before the loop starts, we don't need to set `j` yet. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than 1, and `j` will start at 1.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
