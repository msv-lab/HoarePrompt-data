Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), then `count` is incremented by 1. If they have different parity, `count` remains unchanged. Additionally, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `len(nums)` is greater than 3.***
