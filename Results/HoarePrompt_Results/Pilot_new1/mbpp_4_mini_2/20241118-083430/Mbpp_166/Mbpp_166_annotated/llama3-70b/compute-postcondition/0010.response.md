The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it is indicated that it will increase by 1 if the bitwise XOR of `nums[0]` and `nums[2]` is even. Since the specific values of `nums` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact impact on `count`. However, we know that `count` will be increased by 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
