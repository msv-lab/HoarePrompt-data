Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, and `i` is 0. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity. If the XOR is odd, `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
