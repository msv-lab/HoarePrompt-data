According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` can take on a value within the range defined by `i + 1` and `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is `i + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `i + 3`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the length of `nums` is greater than `i + 3` to allow for this increment.

Given that the length of `nums` is currently greater than `i + 2`, we need to adjust it to ensure it is greater than `i + 3`. 

State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity, `nums` has a length greater than `i + 3`, `j` is `i + 3`**
