Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity. If `nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is 1, the loop will execute at least once for `j` starting from 2. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged. If there are no pairs with the same parity, `count` will remain unchanged after the loop completes.**
