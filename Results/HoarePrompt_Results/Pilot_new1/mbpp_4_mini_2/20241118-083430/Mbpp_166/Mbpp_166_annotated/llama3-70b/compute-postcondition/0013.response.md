Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity, `i` is 0, `j` varies from 1 to len(nums) - 1. If `nums` has only one element, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, `count` will be incremented for each pair of elements that have the same parity.**
