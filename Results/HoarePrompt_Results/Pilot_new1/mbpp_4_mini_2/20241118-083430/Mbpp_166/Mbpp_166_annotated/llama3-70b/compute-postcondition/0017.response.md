The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` represents the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity, and given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the previous value of `count` is not specified but is assumed to be a non-negative integer. Therefore, after execution, `count` increases by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity plus 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `nums` has more than 2 elements, and the integers nums[1] and nums[2] have the same parity.**
