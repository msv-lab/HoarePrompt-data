Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is incremented by 1 if the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, which occurs when both integers are either even or odd. If the XOR is odd, `count` remains 0. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged at 0 and 1, respectively.***
