The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `lst` and the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from `lst`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return the total number of combinations of choosing 2 even integers and 2 odd integers from that list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 even integers and the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from lst.**
