To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description, which states that we need to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Analysis of XOR and Evenness
1. The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd.
2. Therefore, to count pairs that XOR to an even number, we can:
   - Count pairs of even integers.
   - Count pairs of odd integers.

### Breakdown of the Program
1. **Counting Even and Odd Integers**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of even integers (`even_count`) and odd integers (`odd_count`).

2. **Calculating Pairs**:
   - It calculates the number of pairs of even integers using the combination formula \( C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - It does the same for odd integers.

3. **Returning the Total Count**:
   - Finally, it returns the sum of the pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers.

### Testing the Program
The provided assertions check the following cases:
- `func_1([5, 4, 7, 2, 1])` should return 4.
- `func_1([7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11])` should return 9.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` should return 1.

### Verification of Assertions
- For the first case:
  - Even integers: 4, 2 (1 pair)
  - Odd integers: 5, 7, 1 (3 pairs: (5,7), (5,1), (7,1))
  - Total pairs: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)
  
- For the second case:
  - Even integers: 2, 8, 0 (3 pairs: (2,8), (2,0), (8,0))
  - Odd integers: 7, 1, 5, 11 (6 pairs: (7,1), (7,5), (7,11), (1,5), (1,11), (5,11))
  - Total pairs: 3 + 6 = 9 (Correct)

- For the third case:
  - Even integers: 2 (0 pairs)
  - Odd integers: 1, 3 (1 pair: (1,3))
  - Total pairs: 0 + 1 = 1 (Correct)

### Edge Cases
We should also consider edge cases:
- An empty list `func_1([])` should return 0 since there are no pairs.
- A list with one integer `func_1([1])` or `func_1([2])` should also return 0 since at least two integers are needed to form a pair.

### Conclusion
Since the program correctly counts the pairs of integers that XOR to an even number for the provided test cases and correctly handles the edge cases, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
