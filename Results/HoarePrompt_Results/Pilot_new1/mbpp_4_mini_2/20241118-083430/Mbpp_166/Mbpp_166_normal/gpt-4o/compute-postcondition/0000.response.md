The code calculates the number of even integers in the list `lst` by using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. The variable `even_count` is assigned the total count of even numbers found in `lst`. The previous state of `lst` is not specified, but it is a list of integers. Therefore, the output state will reflect the count of even integers in `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst**
