Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd, `i` is such that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`. If the bitwise XOR of nums[i] and nums[j] is even, then `count` is increased by 1, indicating that the pair consists of either two even integers or two odd integers. If nums[i] and nums[j] are of different parity, `count` remains unchanged.***
