Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), then `count` is increased by 1. If they have different parity, `count` remains unchanged. The length of `nums` is greater than `i + 1`, ensuring that `j` is always valid.***
