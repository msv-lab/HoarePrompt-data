According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i + 1` and will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. 

Given that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, it means there are elements in `nums` to iterate over. At the start of the loop, `j` should be equal to `i + 1`, which is the first value it will take during the iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to `i + 1` and that `count` is the number of pairs calculated before the loop starts.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd, `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`**
