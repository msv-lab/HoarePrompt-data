Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even (indicating that both integers are either even or odd), `count` is increased by 1. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are of different parity, `count` remains unchanged.***
