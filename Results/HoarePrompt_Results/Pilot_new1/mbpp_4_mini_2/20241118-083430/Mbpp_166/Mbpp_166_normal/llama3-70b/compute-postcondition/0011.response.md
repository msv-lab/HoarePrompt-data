Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This accounts for the cases where `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are both even, both odd, or one is even and the other is odd, ensuring all scenarios related to the parity of the XOR operation are considered.***
