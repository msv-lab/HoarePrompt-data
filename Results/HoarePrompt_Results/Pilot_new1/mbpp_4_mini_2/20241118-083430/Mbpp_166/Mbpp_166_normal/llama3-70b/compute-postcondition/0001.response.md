According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment with each iteration until it reaches `len(nums) - 1`. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 integer, and `i` should be initialized to 0. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
