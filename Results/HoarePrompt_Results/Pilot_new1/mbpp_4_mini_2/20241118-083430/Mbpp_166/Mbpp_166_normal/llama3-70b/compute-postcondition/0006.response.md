According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to the length of `nums`. The loop starts with `j` set to `i + 1`, and it will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. This means that `i + 1` must be less than `len(nums)`, which indicates that `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`. 

Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, we can deduce that `len(nums)` is at least 2. To ensure that the loop can execute again, `len(nums)` needs to be greater than `i + 1`, meaning we need to adjust the state accordingly.

Thus, the updated state should reflect that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`. Additionally, since `j` will be incremented for the next iteration, `j` should be set to `i + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, j is i + 1, len(nums) is greater than i + 1**
