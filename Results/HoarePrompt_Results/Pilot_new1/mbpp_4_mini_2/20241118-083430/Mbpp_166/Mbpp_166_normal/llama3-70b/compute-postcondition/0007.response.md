The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`nums`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `j` is `i + 1`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `j` is `i + 1`, and `count` is increased by 1**
