Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd, `i` is less than `len(nums)`, `j` is `i + 1`, and the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, indicating that both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).***
