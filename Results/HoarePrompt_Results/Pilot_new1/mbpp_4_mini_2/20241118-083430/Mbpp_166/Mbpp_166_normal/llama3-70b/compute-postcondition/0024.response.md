Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `count` is increased by 1. Given that `i` is such that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is guaranteed to be `i + 2`. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have different parity, `count` remains unchanged.***
