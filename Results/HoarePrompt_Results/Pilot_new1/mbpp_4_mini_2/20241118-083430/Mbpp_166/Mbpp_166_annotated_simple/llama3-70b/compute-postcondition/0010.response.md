The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The values of `nums` and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least `i + 2` integers, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least `i + 2` integers, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1**
