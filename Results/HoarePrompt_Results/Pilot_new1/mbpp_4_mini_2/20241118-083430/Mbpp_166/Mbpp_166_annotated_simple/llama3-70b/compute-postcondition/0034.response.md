Postcondition: ***`count` remains unchanged unless the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, in which case `count` is incremented by 1. Given that `len(nums)` is greater than `k + 2` and `j` is `k + 2`, if the XOR condition holds true, `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains the same.***
