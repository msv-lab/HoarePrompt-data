According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop starts at `j = i + 1`, which means that `j` will be `1` if `i` is `0`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Given that `nums` has at least 1 integer, `len(nums)` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

Since `i` is currently `0`, we can confirm that `j` will start at `1`, and as long as `len(nums)` is greater than `1`, the loop will execute. Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `len(nums)` is greater than 1. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
