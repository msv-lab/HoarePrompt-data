Postcondition: ***`count` represents the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `j` is `i + 2`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity (both even or both odd), then `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.***
