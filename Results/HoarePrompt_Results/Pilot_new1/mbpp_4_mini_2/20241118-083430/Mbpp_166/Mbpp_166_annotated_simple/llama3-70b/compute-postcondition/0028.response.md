According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `len(nums)`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `len(nums)`; since it is given that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will take on the value of `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `count` remains unchanged, `i` is `k + 1`, and `j` starts at `i + 1`, which is `k + 2`. 

State: **`count` is unchanged, `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is k + 1, `j` is k + 2**
