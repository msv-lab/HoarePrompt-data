Postcondition: ***`count` represents the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, indicating that both numbers are either even or odd. If the condition `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0` holds true, then `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `nums` and the relationship between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` remain unchanged.***
