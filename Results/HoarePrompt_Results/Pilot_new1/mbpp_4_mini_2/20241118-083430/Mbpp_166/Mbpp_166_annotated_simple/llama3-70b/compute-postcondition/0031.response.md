Postcondition: ***`count` remains unchanged unless the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, in which case `count` is incremented by 1. `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, with `i` being `k + 1` and `j` being `k + 2`, ensuring that both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are valid elements within the list.***
