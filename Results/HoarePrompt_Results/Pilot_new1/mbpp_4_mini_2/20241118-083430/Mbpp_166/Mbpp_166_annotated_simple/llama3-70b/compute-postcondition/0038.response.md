According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `len(nums)`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k + 3` and `len(nums)` is greater than `k + 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `k + 4`. Therefore, `len(nums)` must also be greater than `k + 4` to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`count` remains unchanged, `j` is `k + 4`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `k + 4`**
