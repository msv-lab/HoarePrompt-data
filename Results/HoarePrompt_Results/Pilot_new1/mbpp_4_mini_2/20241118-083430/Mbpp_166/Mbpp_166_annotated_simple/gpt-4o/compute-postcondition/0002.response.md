The variable `even_pairs` is assigned the value of `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `even_count` is used directly for the calculation. The previous values of `even_count` and `odd_count` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation of `even_pairs` based on the current value of `even_count`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst, and `even_pairs` is calculated as even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2**
