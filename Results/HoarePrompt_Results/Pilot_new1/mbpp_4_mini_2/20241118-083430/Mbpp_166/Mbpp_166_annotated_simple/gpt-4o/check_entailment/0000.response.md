To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic behind it.

### Problem Description
The task is to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Understanding XOR and Evenness
1. The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are even or both integers are odd.
2. Thus, we need to count:
   - The number of pairs of even integers.
   - The number of pairs of odd integers.

### Analyzing the Program
```python
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)  # Count of even numbers
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count  # Count of odd numbers
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2  # Pairs of even numbers
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2  # Pairs of odd numbers
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs  # Total pairs that XOR to an even number
```

### Breakdown of the Code
1. `even_count` counts how many integers in the list are even.
2. `odd_count` is derived from the total length of the list minus the `even_count`.
3. `even_pairs` calculates the number of ways to pick 2 even integers from `even_count`.
4. `odd_pairs` calculates the number of ways to pick 2 odd integers from `odd_count`.
5. The function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`.

### Verification of Logic
- The calculations for `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` are correct based on combinatorial mathematics (choosing 2 items from a set).
- The program correctly identifies pairs of integers that XOR to an even number based on the properties of even and odd integers.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. If the list is empty (`[]`), the function should return `0` since there are no pairs.
2. If the list contains one element (e.g., `[1]` or `[2]`), the function should also return `0` since a pair cannot be formed.
3. If the list contains all even or all odd numbers, the function should still correctly count the pairs.

### Conclusion
I can think of no cases where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements. The logic is sound, and the implementation adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number for all potential cases.
