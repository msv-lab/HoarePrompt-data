The variable `odd_pairs` is assigned the value of `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `odd_count` is taken from the initial state, and it is used to calculate `odd_pairs`. The other variables (`lst`, `even_count`, and `even_pairs`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables after the assignment.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is calculated as even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2, and `odd_pairs` is calculated as odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2**
