According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, and `first_char` is the first character of `s`. 

Since `char` is the current character being iterated over, and we need the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be adjusted to the next character in the string `s`. If `first_char` is the first character of `s`, then after the last iteration, `char` must be the last character of `s` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `char` needs to be set to the next character after the current `char`, and the iteration index should reflect that.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the next character in `s**.
