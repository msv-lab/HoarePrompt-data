Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the character that follows `first_char` in `s`. If `char` is different from `first_char`, the function returns False. If `char` is the same as `first_char`, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).***
