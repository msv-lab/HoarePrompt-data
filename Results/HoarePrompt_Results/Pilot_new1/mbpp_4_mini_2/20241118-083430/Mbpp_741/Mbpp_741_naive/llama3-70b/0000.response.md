Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set. A set only contains unique elements, so if the length of the set is 1, it means all characters in the string are identical. 

This implementation correctly handles various cases:
- For an empty string `""`, the set will be empty, and the length will be 0, which is consistent with the idea that there are no characters that differ.
- For a string with one character, e.g., `"a"`, the set will contain one element, so the length will be 1, indicating all characters are the same.
- For a string with multiple identical characters, e.g., `"aaaa"`, the set will also contain one element, and the function will return `True`.
- For strings with different characters, e.g., `"abc"`, the set will have a length greater than 1, and the function will return `False`.

In all potential cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
