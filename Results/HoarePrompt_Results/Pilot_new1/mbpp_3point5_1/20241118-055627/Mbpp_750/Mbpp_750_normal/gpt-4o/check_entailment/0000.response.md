Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input and concatenates them into a new list where the elements of `lst` appear first followed by the elements of `tpl`. The code simply returns the result of concatenating the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl` converted to a list using the `list()` function. The code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
