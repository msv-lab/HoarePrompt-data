Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it to the original list `lst`. The resulting list is then returned, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. The code annotations also confirm that the program returns the concatenation of the list `lst` and the elements of tuple `tup` as a list, further supporting the correctness of the code. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
