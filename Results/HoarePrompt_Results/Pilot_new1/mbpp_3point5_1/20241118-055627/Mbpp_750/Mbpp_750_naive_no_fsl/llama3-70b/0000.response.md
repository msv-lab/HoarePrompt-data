Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input and concatenates the elements of the tuple to the list. The program correctly converts the tuple to a list using `list(tup)` and then concatenates it with the original list `lst`. This implementation satisfies the problem description for all potential cases, as it adds the given tuple to the given list as required.
