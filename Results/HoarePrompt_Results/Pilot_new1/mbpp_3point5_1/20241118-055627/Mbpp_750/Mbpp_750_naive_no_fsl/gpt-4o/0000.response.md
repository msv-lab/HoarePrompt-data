Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, converts the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`, and then concatenates it with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. The program then asserts that the output of the function matches the expected result for three different test cases. In all cases, the function correctly adds the tuple elements to the list and returns the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
