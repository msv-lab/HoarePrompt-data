Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The program only returns 0, 2, 3, or 4 for any input, which does not accurately represent the last digit of the factorial of the given number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120, so the last digit should be 0, but the program would return 0 instead of 0.
