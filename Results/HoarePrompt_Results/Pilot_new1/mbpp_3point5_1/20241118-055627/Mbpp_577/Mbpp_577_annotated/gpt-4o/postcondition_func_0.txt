The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If n is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. Otherwise, for n less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the factorial. The variable `factorial` is initialized to 1 for n less than 5. The code accurately performs the factorial calculation and returns the last digit for n less than 5. However, there is a missing case description in the annotation where n is exactly 5, which should also return 0 based on the current implementation.
