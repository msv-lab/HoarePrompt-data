The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n`, where the factorial is initialized to 1, and updates it by multiplying it with each integer from 1 to `n`. Finally, the function returns the last digit of the calculated factorial. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `n` is less than 5, it calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0. If n is less than 5, it calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the factorial.**
