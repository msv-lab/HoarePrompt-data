Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0. If n is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of n by multiplying each integer from 1 to n and returns the last digit of the calculated factorial. The code does not handle cases where n is negative, and it does not return a specific value for these cases.**
