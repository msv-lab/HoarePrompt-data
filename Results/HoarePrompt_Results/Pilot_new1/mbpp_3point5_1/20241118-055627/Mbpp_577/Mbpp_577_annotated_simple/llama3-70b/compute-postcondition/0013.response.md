The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. After executing the function body, if `n` is less than 2, the function returns `n`. If `n` is equal to 2 or 3, the function returns `n`. If `n` is equal to 4, the function returns 4. For all other cases where `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` greater than or equal to 0 and return different values based on the specified conditions for `n`.
