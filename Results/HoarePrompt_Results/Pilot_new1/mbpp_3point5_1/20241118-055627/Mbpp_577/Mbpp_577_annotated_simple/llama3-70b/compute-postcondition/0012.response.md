Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If n is less than 2, the function returns n. If n is equal to 2 or 3, the function returns n. If n is equal to 4, the function returns 4. For all other cases where n is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that the function handles all edge cases and provides the expected results based on the specified conditions.***
