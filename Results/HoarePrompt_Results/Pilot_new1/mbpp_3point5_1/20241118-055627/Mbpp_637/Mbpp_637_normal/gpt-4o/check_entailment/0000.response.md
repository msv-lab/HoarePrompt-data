Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price` and returns True if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, otherwise it returns False. The code is correctly implementing the problem description for all potential cases. The provided test cases also confirm that the code is working as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
