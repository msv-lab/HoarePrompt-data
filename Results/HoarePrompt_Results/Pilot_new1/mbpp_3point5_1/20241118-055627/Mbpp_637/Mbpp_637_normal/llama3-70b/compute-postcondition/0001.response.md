The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cost_price` and `selling_price`, both of which are integers representing the cost price and selling price of an item. After executing the function body, if the cost price is equal to the selling price, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters representing the cost price and selling price of an item, and return True if the cost price is equal to the selling price. If they are not equal, it returns False.
