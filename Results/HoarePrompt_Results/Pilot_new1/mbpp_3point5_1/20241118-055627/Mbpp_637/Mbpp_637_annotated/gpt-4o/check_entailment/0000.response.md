Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters representing the cost price and selling price of an item. It then checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price and returns True if they are equal, otherwise it returns False. This matches the problem description accurately.

The annotations also confirm that the program returns True only when the cost price is equal to the selling price, which aligns with the problem description. Since there are no cases provided where the program would not work as expected, and the code and annotations both support the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed to be True.
