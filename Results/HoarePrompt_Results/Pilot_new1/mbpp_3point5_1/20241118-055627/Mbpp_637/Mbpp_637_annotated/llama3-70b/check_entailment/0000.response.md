Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price and returns True if they are equal, otherwise it returns False. The problem description asks for a function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss, which is exactly what the code is doing. The annotations also confirm that the program returns True if the cost price is equal to the selling price. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations, and there are no cases provided where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is True.
