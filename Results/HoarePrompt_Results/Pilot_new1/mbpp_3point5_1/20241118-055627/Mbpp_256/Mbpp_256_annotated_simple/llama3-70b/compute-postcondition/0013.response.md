According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the next integer after the previous value, and `num` is not divisible by the new `i` value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next integer after the current value.

State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the next integer after the previous value, `num` is not divisible by the new `i` value**
