Output State: **If num is less than 2, the loop does not execute and there are no changes to the variables. If num is greater than or equal to 2, the loop iterates through the range from 2 to the square root of num (inclusive). If num is divisible by any i in this range, the function returns False. If num is not divisible by any i, the loop completes without altering the variables.**
