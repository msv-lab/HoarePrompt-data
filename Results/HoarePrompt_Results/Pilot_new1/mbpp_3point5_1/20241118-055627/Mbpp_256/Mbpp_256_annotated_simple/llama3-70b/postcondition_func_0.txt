The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n and calculates the number of prime numbers between 2 and n-1. The function iterates through numbers from 2 to n-1, checks if each number is prime using the is_prime function, and increments a count for each prime number found. Finally, it returns the total count of prime numbers. However, the code does not handle the case where n is less than 2, resulting in the function not executing the loop. This missing functionality should be considered in the summary.
