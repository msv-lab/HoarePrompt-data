The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case 1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any alterations.

Case 2: If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop iterates through the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). If `num` is divisible by any `i` in this range, the function returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any `i`, the loop completes without altering the variables.

Case 3: The program returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number based on the above cases. If `num` is less than 2, it returns False. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2 and not divisible by any number in the specified range, it returns True.
