Output State: **If n is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute and all elements in is_prime remain True. If n is greater than 2, the loop iterates through the range of 2 to the square root of n and sets all multiples of i as False in the is_prime list. After the loop executes, is_prime contains True for prime numbers and False for composite numbers up to n.**
