According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than `n - i + i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n - i + i`, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with certain elements set to False. To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is less than `n - i + i` holds true. In this case, we need to increment `j` by `i` to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n - i + i + i`, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with certain elements set to False**
