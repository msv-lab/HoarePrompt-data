The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns the sum of elements in the 'is_prime' list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, the function returns the sum of elements in the 'is_prime' list.
