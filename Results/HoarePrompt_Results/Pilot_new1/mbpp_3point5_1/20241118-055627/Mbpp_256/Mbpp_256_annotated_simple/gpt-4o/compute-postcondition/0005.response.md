According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 2. Before the loop starts, the initial state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to True, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are set to False**
