According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. In this case, `j` is dependent on `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`. Before the loop starts, the state should be adjusted so that `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, and `j` is set to `i * i` for the loop to execute.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, and the element at index 3 in `is_prime` is False, `j` is `i * i`**
