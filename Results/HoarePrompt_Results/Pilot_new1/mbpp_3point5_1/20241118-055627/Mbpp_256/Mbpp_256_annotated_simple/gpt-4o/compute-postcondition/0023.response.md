According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `(i+1) * (i+1)`, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, the element at index 3 in `is_prime` is False, `j` is `(i+1) * (i+1) + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be less than `n`. Since `j` is `(i+1) * (i+1) + i`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the new value of `j`. So, the new value of `i` will be 4. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `(i+1) * (i+1)`, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, the element at index 3 in `is_prime` is False, `j` is `(i+1) * (i+1) + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
