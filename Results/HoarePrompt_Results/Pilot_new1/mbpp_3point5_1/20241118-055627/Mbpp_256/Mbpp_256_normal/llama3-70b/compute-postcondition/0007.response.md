According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous square root of `num`.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the next integer after int(num ** 0.5)**
