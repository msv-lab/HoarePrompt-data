According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is the next integer after `num + 1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. 
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`**
