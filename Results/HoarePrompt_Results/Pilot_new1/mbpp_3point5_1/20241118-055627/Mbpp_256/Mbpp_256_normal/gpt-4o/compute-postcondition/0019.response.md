According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, `i` is a value that satisfies the loop range conditions, and all values in `is_prime` except for `is_prime[j]` are unchanged and set to True. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted such that it is within the range specified. This means `j` needs to be incremented by `i`. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, `i` is a value that satisfies the loop range conditions, all values in `is_prime` except for `is_prime[j]` are unchanged and set to True, `j` is incremented by `i`**
