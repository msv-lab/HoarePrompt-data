According to the code, the loop will execute again if there exists an integer `i` such that `i * i < n` and `is_prime[i]` is True. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i < n`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `i` should be the smallest integer greater than the current `i` such that `i * i < n` and `is_prime[i]` is True. Additionally, the value of `is_prime[j]` should be set to False for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the current `i` such that `i * i < n`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False for the next iteration**
