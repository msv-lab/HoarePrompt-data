Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`, the loop iterates through the multiples of `i` starting from `i*i` up to `n` and marks the corresponding indices in `is_prime` as False. If `i` is greater than the square root of `n`, the loop won't execute.***
