Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` correctly handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 2 by returning 0.
- It then uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to calculate prime numbers up to `n` and returns the sum of boolean values in the list `is_prime`.
- The code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, ensuring that all prime numbers less than the given non-negative number are correctly identified and counted. 
- The code covers all potential cases and provides the expected output for each scenario described in the problem statement.
