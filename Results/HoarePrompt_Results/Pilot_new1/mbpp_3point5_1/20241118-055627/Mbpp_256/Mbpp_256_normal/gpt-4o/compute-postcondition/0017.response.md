According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. The loop will iterate over the range starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step size of `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be adjusted to a value that satisfies the loop range conditions. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, `i` is a value that satisfies the loop range conditions**
