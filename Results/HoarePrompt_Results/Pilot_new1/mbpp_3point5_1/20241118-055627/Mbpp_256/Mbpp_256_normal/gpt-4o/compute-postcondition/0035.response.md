Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True. If `i` is a prime number, then the loop will mark all multiples of `i` as not prime in the `is_prime` list. The loop will execute as long as `i * i < n`. If `i` is not a prime number, the loop will not execute. The postcondition covers the scenario where `i` is a prime number and the loop updates the `is_prime` list accordingly, as well as the scenario where `i` is not a prime number and the loop does not modify the `is_prime` list.***
