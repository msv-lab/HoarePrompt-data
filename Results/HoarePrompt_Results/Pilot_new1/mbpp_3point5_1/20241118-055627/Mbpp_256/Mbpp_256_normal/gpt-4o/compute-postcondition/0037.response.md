Output State: 
- If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, maintaining the initial state of `is_prime`.
- If `n` is 2 or greater, after the loop executes, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True. For each prime number `i` less than or equal to the square root of `n`, all multiples of `i` within the range of `i * i` to `n` (exclusive) are marked as False in the `is_prime` list. The loop will not execute if `i * i >= n`. 
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n` to mark their multiples as False in `is_prime`. 
- The final output state ensures that `is_prime` accurately represents the primality of numbers up to `n`.

Output State: **If n is less than 2, the loop doesn't execute and is_prime remains with is_prime[0] and is_prime[1] set to False. If n is 2 or greater, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] and is_prime[1] are True, and multiples of prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of n are marked as False.**
