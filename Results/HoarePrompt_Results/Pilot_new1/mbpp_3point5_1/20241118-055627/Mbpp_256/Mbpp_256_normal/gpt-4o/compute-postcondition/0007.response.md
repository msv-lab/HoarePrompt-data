According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is used in the loop range calculation, it needs to be adjusted accordingly. The loop will execute if `i` is such that `i * i < n`. Before the loop starts, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, and the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True. To ensure the loop executes, `i` should be set to the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i < n`.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that `i * i < n`**
