According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i * i < n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True. The loop will not execute if `i * i >= n`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than or equal to the square root of `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`**
