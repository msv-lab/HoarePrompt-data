Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 3. For any value of `j` where `i * i <= j < n` and `j` is a multiple of `i`, `is_prime[j]` is False. If `i` is greater than the square root of `n`, the loop does not execute.***
