According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `j` is less than `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated value of `j + i`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to a value greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, since `i` is 4, the new value of `j` should be at least `i * i + i` to satisfy the loop condition. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 4, `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, `is_prime[16]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated value of `j + i`**
