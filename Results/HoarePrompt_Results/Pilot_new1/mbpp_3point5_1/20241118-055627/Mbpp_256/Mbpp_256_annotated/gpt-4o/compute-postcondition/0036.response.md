According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 4. Since the loop is iterating over `i` from 2 to the square root of `n`, the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1. No changes need to be made to the `n` variable. The `is_prime` list should be updated based on the multiples of `i` to mark them as False. 
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with updated values, `i` is 5**
