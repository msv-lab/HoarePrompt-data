According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than `i * i` and `i` is greater than 2. Additionally, `j` should be within the range of `n` and be a multiple of `i`. Before the loop starts, the initial value of `i` is 4, so `i` meets the condition. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than or equal to 16 (since `i * i = 4 * 4 = 16`) and `j` should be equal to `i * i`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to 16.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 4, `j` is 16**
