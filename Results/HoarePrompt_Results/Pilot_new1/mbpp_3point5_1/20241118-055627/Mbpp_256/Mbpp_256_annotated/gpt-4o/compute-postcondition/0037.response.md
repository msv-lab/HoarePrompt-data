Output State: 
- If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and the function returns 0.
- If `n` is greater than 2, after the loop executes, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`. The loop iterates through the range from 2 to the square root of `n`, marking multiples of `i` as False in the `is_prime` list. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the loop does not execute. After the loop completes, `is_prime` will have updated values for multiples of `i` less than `n`.
