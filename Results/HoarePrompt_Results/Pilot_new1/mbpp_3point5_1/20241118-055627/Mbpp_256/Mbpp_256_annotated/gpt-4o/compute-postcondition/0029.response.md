According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 16. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 4, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[16]` is False**
