Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is less than or equal to 2, it returns 0. For n greater than 2, it generates a list 'is_prime' of boolean values where True indicates a prime number. The function then calculates the sum of these boolean values in the 'is_prime' list and returns the result. If n is less than or equal to the square of i during the loop execution, the loop will not mark multiples of i as False. **
