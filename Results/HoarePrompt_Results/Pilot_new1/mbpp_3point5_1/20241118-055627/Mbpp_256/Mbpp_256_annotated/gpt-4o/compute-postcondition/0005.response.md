According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 2. Before the loop starts, `n` being a non-negative integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2. Additionally, since the loop starts from 2, the value of `i` at the beginning of the loop should be 2. 
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to True, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2**
