According to the code, the loop can execute if `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. The loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `num`, so `num` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is a non-negative integer, so it already meets the condition. 
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4**
