According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, the next `i` value should be considered. Since `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next `i` value should be the current `i` value plus 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the `i` value.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**
