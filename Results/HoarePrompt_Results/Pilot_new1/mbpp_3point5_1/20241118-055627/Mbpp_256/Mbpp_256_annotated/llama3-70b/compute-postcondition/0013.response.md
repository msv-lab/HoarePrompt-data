According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, and `i` has been incremented by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again since it is within the range specified in the loop. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2**
