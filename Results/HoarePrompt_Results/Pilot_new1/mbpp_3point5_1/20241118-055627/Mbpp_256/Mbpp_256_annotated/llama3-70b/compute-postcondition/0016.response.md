The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. In all other cases where `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the program does not alter the state of `num`.

If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If `num` is greater than or equal to 4, the loop checks if `num` is divisible by `i` where `i` ranges from 2 to the square root of `num` rounded up. If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `num` and `i`.

If the program reaches the end of the loop without returning False, it returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number by checking if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num` rounded up. If `num` is less than 2, it returns False. If `num` is a prime number, it returns True.
