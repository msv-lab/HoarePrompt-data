Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines a nested function `is_prime` that correctly determines if a number is prime.
2. The main function `func_1` correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`.
3. The program iterates through numbers from 2 to n-1 and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function.
4. The program returns the count of prime numbers, which fulfills the problem description.
5. The program handles the case when n is less than 2 by correctly returning 0 prime numbers, as there are no prime numbers less than 2.
