After executing the function body, the program returns the volume calculated based on the given `radius` and `height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the calculated volume based on these parameters. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative numbers, radius and height, and returns the calculated volume based on these parameters.**
