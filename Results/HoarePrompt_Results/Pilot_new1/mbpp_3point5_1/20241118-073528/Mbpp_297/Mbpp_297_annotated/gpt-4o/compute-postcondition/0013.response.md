Example Answer:
The `item` is appended to the `flat_list`. The `flat_list` will now have the `item` added to its elements. The `nested_list` and other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration with the addition of the new item.**
