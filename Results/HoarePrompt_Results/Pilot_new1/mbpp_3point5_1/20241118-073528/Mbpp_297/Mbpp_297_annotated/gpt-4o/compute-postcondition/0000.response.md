Example Answer:
The list `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, `flat_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, `flat_list` is an empty list**
