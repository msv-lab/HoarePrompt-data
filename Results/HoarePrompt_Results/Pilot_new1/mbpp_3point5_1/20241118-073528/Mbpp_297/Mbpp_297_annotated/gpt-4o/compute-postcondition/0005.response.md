Example Answer:
The value of `item` is appended to `flat_list`. Since `item` is the first item in `nested_list` and it is not a list, `item` is added to `flat_list`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list contains the value of item, item is the first item in nested_list and is not a list**
