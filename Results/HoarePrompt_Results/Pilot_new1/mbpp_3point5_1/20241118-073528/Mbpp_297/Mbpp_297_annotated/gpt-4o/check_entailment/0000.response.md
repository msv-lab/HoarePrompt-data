Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the function to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively flattens all nested lists within the input list and returns a single flattened list as expected. The annotations also confirm that the code handles all possible cases of nested lists and non-list items, ensuring that the output is always flattened correctly. Additionally, the annotations mention that the code correctly handles the case where the input nested_list is empty, which is in line with the problem description. Overall, the code matches the problem description and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation.
