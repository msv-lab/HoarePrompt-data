Example Answer:
The `func_1` function is called with the parameter `item`, and the return value of `func_1(item)` is then extended to the `flat_list`. The `nested_list` remains unchanged. The output state is: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration after extending with the return value of `func_1(item)`.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration after extending with the return value of `func_1(item)`**
