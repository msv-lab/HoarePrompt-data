According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more items left in the nested_list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, and flat_list contains all the elements of nested_list flattened. The program ensures that all elements of nested_list are flattened into flat_list. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next item in the nested_list needs to be processed. If the next item is a list, it should be flattened using func_1(item) and added to flat_list. If the next item is not a list, its value should be added to flat_list.

State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration**
