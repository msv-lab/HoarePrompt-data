The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a list that may contain nested lists. After executing the function body, the program returns `flat_list`, which is the flattened version of `nested_list` after applying the `func_1` function to all nested lists. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list` that may contain nested lists and return a flattened version of the input list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a list that may contain nested lists. It returns `flat_list`, which is the flattened version of `nested_list` after applying the function to all nested lists.**
