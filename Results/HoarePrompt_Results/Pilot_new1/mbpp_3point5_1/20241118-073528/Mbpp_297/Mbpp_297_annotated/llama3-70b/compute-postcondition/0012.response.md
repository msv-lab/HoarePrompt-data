Example Answer:
`element` is the third element in `nested_list`. `func_1` is a function that takes `element` as input and returns a list. The list returned by `func_1(element)` is then extended to `flat_list`. The previous values of `nested_list`, `element`, and `flat_list` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the third element in nested_list, flat_list is extended by the list returned from func_1(element).
Output State: **nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the third element in nested_list, flat_list is extended by the list returned from func_1(element)**
