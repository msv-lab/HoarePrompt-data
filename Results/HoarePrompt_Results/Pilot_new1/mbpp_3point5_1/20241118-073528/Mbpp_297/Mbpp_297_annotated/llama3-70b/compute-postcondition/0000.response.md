Example Answer:
The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, flat_list is an empty list.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, flat_list is an empty list**
