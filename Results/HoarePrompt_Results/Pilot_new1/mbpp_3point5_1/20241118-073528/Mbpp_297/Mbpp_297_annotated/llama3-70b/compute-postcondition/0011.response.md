According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more elements left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the second element in nested_list. So for the loop to execute one more time, the nested_list must still have at least two elements and the element should be the third element in nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the third element in nested_list**
