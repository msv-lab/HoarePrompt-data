According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the third element in nested_list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the nested_list must have at least 3 elements, and element should be the fourth element in nested_list. 

State: **nested_list is a list with at least three elements, element is the fourth element in nested_list**
