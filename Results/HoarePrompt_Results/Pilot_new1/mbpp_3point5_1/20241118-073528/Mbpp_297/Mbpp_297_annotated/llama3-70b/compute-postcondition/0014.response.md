Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the third element in nested_list. If element is a list, flat_list is extended by the list returned from func_1(element). If element is not a list, flat_list is updated to include the element value. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios when the if-else block is executed, ensuring the integrity of the variables and their relationships.***
