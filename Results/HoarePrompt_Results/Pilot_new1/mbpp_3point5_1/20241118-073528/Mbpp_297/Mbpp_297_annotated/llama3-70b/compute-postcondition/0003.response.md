Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with the `element` as an argument, and the return value is extended to `flat_list`. The initial state shows that `element` is the first element of `nested_list`, which means `func_1` is applied to the first element of `nested_list`. Therefore, the output state is: nested_list is a list with at least one element, element is the first element in nested_list, flat_list is populated with the result of func_1 applied to the first element.
Output State: **nested_list is a list with at least one element, element is the first element in nested_list, flat_list is populated with the result of func_1 applied to the first element**
