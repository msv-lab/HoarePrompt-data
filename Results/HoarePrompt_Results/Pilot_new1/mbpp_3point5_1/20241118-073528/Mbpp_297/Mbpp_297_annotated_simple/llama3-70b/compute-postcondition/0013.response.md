Example Answer:
The element is appended to the `flat_list`. If the element is a list, `func_1(element)` is called and the result is added to `flat_list`. The previous values of `nested_list` and `flat_list` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 2 elements, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 2 elements, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list**
