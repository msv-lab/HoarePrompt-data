Example Answer: 
The `func_1` function is called with the `element` as an argument, and the return value is appended to the `flat_list` using the `extend` method. Since `element` is a list, `func_1` may process this list and return a new list. The `flat_list` will be updated with the returned list. Therefore, the output state is: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)`.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)`**
