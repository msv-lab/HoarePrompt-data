According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `nested_list` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, the `nested_list` is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 2 elements, and `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if `element` is a list, or the appended element if `element` is not a list.

To execute the loop one more time, the `nested_list` must still contain more elements to iterate over. Additionally, the `flat_list` should be updated based on the type of the next `element` in the `nested_list`.

State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 2 elements, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list**
