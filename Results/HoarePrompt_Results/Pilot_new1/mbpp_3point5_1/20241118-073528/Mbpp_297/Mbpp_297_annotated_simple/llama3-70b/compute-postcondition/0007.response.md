According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements left in the `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, and `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list. If element is not a list, `flat_list` contains the appended element. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `nested_list` needs to be considered. If the next element is a list, it should be processed by `func_1` and added to `flat_list`. If the next element is not a list, it should be directly appended to `flat_list`.
State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list**
