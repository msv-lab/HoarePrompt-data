Postcondition: ***nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 3 elements. If item is a list, flat_list is extended with the return values of func_1(item). If item is not a list, flat_list has an additional element from item. The postcondition covers all possible cases when the if else block executes, ensuring the integrity of nested_list and flat_list after the execution.***
