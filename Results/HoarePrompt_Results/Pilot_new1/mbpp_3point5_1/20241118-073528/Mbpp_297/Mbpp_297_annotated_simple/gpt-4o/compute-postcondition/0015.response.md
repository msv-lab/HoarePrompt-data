According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements within the nested_list. If there are more elements left in the nested_list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 3 elements. The postcondition ensures the integrity of nested_list and flat_list after the execution. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the nested_list must have more than 3 elements.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with more than 3 elements, flat_list is updated according to the postcondition**
