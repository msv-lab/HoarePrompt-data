Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively iterating through the elements of the list. The program checks if each element is a list, and if so, it recursively calls the function on that element until all nested lists are flattened. The program then appends the non-list elements to the flat_list. This logic covers all potential cases of nested lists and correctly flattens them.
