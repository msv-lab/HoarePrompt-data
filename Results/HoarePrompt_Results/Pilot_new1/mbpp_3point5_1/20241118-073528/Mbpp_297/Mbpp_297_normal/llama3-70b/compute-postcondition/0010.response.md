Postcondition: ***nested_list contains more elements. If the next element in nested_list is a list, func_1 is applied to the element and the result is appended to flat_list. If the next element is not a list, it is directly appended to flat_list. The modification of flat_list is appropriately handled based on the type of the next element in nested_list, ensuring that all elements are correctly added to flat_list.***
