Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that contains at least 1 element, flat_list is a list. If the first element in nested_list is a list, flat_list contains the elements returned by func_1(element). If the first element in nested_list is not a list, flat_list contains the appended element. The program handles the case where the first element in nested_list is either a list or not, ensuring that flat_list is appropriately modified based on the type of the first element.***
