According to the code, for the loop to execute, the nested_list must have at least 1 element. Since flat_list is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. At the beginning of the loop, the element should be the first element in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a list that contains at least 1 element, flat_list is an empty list, element is the first element in nested_list**
