According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `nested_list`. If there are still elements left in the `nested_list`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 3 elements. The state of `flat_list` depends on the type of `item` - if `item` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`, and if `item` is not a list, `item` is appended to `flat_list`.

To execute the loop one more time, the next `item` in `nested_list` needs to be considered. If the next `item` is a list, `flat_list` will be extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. If the next `item` is not a list, it will be appended to `flat_list`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 3 elements, `flat_list` is a list.**
