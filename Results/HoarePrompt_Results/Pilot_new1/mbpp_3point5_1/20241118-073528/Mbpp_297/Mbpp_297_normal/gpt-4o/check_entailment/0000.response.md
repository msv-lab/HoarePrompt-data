Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and recursively flattens the nested list structure to return a flat list containing all the elements from the nested lists. The code iterates through each item in the input list, and if the item is a list, it recursively calls the `func_1` function on that list. If the item is not a list, it appends the item to the `flat_list`. This process continues until all nested lists are flattened.

The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly handles nested lists and returns a flat list with all elements from the nested lists. The code also passes the provided test cases, confirming its correctness. The output hints also correctly describe the functionality of the code, which further supports the correctness of the program.
