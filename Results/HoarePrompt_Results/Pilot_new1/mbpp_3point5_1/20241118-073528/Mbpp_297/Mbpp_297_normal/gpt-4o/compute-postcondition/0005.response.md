Example Answer:
The `item` which is the first element of `nested_list` is appended to `flat_list`. Since `item` is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`. After execution, `flat_list` will contain the `item` that was in `nested_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains the `item` that was in `nested_list`, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`, and `item` is not a list.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains the `item` that was in `nested_list`, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`, and `item` is not a list**
