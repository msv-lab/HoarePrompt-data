Example Answer:
The `item` is appended to `flat_list`. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. Since we don't have information about the content of `item` or the function `func_1`, we can only state that `item` is appended to `flat_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` is a list with `item` appended.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` is a list with `item` appended**
