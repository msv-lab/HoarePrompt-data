Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function that takes a string as input and replaces all spaces in the string with '%20'. The code annotations also confirm that the program returns the input string with spaces replaced by '%20. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, and upon reviewing the code and annotations, it seems like the code covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the code is true.
