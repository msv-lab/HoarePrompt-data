Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that takes two lists as input, converts them to sets to remove duplicates, then uses the XOR operator (^) to find the symmetric difference between the two sets, and finally returns the sorted result as a list. This logic correctly implements the problem description of getting the difference between two lists. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected.
