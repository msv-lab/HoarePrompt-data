Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input lists have duplicate elements. When there are duplicate elements in the input lists, the `index` method used in the lambda function may not give the correct order of elements in the result list. For example:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 2, 3], [3, 2, 2]) == [1]
```
In this case, the expected output should be `[1]` but the program will return `[3]` due to how the `index` method works with duplicates.
