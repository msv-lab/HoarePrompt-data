Example Answer:
The set `diff_elements` is assigned the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`. This operation returns a new set containing elements that are present in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both. The values of `list1`, `set1`, and `set2` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`list1` is unchanged, `set1` contains unique elements from `list1`, `set2` contains unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` contains elements that are in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both**
