Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes two lists, finds the symmetric difference between them, sorts the result list based on the index of elements in the concatenation of the two input lists, and returns the sorted result list. The annotations also confirm that this is the intended behavior of the code. There are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description and the annotations provided.
