Example Answer:
The `result_list` is assigned the list of elements in `diff_elements`. The `diff_elements` contain elements that are in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both. Therefore, the `result_list` will contain these differing elements. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`list1` is unchanged, `set1` contains unique elements from `list1`, `set2` contains unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` contains elements that are in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both, `result_list` contains the elements in `diff_elements`**
