Example Answer:
The set `set1` is created by converting `list1` into a set. The elements in a set are unique, so duplicates are removed. The output state will be that `list1` remains unchanged, while `set1` contains the unique elements from `list1`.
Output State: **`list1` is unchanged, `set1` contains unique elements from `list1`**
