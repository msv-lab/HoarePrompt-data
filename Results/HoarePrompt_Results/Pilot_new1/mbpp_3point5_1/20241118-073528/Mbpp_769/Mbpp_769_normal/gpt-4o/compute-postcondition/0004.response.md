Example Answer:
The `result_list` is sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`. The order of elements in `result_list` is determined by the position of elements in the concatenated list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing unique elements, `result_list` is a list containing elements unique to either `set1` or `set2` sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing unique elements, `result_list` is a list containing elements unique to either `set1` or `set2` sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`**
