The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both.
