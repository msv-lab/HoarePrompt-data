Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly implements the XOR operation on the sets created from `list1` and `list2` to get the elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. The code aligns with the problem description and there are no edge cases where the code does not behave as expected. The output hints also agree with the code and further confirm that the function is correctly implemented.
