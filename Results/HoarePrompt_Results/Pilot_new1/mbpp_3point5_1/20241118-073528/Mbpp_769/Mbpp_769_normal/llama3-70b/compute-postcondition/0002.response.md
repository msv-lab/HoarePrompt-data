Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. It then returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. The function correctly implements the XOR operation on the sets created from `list1` and `list2` to achieve this. **
