Example Answer:
The `symmetric_difference` method returns a new set containing elements that are present in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both. The variable `diff_elements` is assigned this new set. The previous values of `list1`, `list2`, `set1`, and `set2` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from the elements in `list1`, `set2` is a set created from the elements in `list2`, and `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are present in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from the elements in `list1`, `set2` is a set created from the elements in `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are present in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both**
