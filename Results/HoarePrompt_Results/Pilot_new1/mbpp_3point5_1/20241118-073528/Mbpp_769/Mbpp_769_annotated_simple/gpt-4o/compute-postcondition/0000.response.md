Example Answer: 
A set named `set1` is created from the elements in `list1`. The values of `list1` and `list2` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists, and `set1` is a set created from the elements in `list1`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, and `set1` is a set created from the elements in `list1`**
