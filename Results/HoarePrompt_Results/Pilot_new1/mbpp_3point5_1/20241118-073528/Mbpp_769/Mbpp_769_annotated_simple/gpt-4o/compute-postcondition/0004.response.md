Example Answer:
The `result_list` is sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`. The sorting is done in ascending order. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from the elements in `list1`, `set2` is a set created from the elements in `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are present in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both, `result_list` is a list of elements in `diff_elements` sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from the elements in `list1`, `set2` is a set created from the elements in `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are present in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both, `result_list` is a list of elements in `diff_elements` sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`**
