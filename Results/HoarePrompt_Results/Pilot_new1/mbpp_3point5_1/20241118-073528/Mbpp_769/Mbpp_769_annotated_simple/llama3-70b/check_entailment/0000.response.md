Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function correctly implements the logic to get the difference between two lists. It first converts the lists to sets to remove duplicates, then uses the XOR operator (^) to find elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. Finally, it sorts the resulting list before returning it. The function works as expected for all potential cases and follows the problem description.
