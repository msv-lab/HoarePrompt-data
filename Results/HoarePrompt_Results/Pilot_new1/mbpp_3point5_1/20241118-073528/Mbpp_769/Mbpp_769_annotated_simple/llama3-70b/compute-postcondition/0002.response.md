Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, which are lists. It then returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. The function correctly implements this by utilizing set operations to find the symmetric difference between the two lists and then sorting the result. It covers the case where both lists are empty by returning an empty list. **
