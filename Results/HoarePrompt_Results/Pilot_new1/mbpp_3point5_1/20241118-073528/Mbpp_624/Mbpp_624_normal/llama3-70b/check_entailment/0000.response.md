Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple one-liner that uses the `upper()` method in Python to convert a given string to uppercase. The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the uppercase version of the string `s`. There are no edge cases to consider here, and the code directly aligns with the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the function is correctly implemented as it precisely describes the functionality of the code.
