Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. The annotations also confirm that the program indeed returns the uppercase version of the input string. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations, and there are no potential cases mentioned where the code might fail, we can conclude that the code is correct.
