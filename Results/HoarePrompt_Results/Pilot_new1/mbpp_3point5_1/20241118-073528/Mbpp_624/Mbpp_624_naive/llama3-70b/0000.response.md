Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` simply calls the `upper()` method on the input string `s`, which converts all characters in the string to uppercase. This is the expected behavior based on the problem description. The `upper()` method in Python is designed to convert all lowercase characters in a string to uppercase, so there are no potential cases where this function would not work as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
