Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple. The issue lies in the fact that the program uses `tup.index(elem)` to find the index of the tuple element, but `index()` method only returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the tuple. If there are multiple occurrences of the tuple element in the tuple, the program will not give the correct number of elements that occur before the tuple element.

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, (3, 4), 5, (3, 4))`, the program will incorrectly return `2` as the number of elements that occur before the tuple element `(3, 4)`, whereas the correct answer should be `3`.
