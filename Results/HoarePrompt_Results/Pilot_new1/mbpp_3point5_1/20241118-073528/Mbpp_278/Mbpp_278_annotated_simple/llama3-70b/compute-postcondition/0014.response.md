Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and iterates through its elements. If the element is a tuple, it returns the index of the first occurrence of that tuple within `tup`. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the function returns the length of `tup`. However, the function does not handle the case where there are nested tuples within `tup` and only checks for direct tuple elements.**
