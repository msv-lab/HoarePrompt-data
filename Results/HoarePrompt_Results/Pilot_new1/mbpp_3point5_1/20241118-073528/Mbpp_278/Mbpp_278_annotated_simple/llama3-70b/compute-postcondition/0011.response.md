Output State: **If `tup` is a tuple with at least one element and that element is a tuple, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the tuple in `tup`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of `tup` and `elem`. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the state of the program variables.**
