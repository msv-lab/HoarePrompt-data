The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing elements, some of which may be tuples. 

Case_1: If the first element `elem` in `tup` is a tuple, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `elem` in `tup`. If `elem` is not a tuple, the function returns None. If there are no tuples in `tup`, the loop does not execute, and the function returns None.

Case_2: The function returns the length of the tuple `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` containing elements, some of which may be tuples. It then checks if the first element is a tuple and returns the index of its first occurrence, or returns None if it is not a tuple. If there are no tuples in `tup`, it returns None. Additionally, the function returns the length of the tuple `tup`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, which is a tuple containing elements, some of which may be tuples. It returns the index of the first occurrence of a tuple in tup, or None if there are no tuples. It also returns the length of the tuple tup.**
