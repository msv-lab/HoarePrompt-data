Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the elements of the input tuple `tup` and returns the index of the first occurrence of a tuple in `tup` if found. If no tuple is found in `tup`, it returns the length of the tuple `tup`. This aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code and further support the correctness of the function. Since the function seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, the correctness is determined to be True.
