Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing elements, some of which may be tuples. It iterates through the elements of `tup` and returns the index of the first occurrence of a tuple in `tup` if found. If no tuple is found in `tup`, it returns None. Additionally, the function returns the length of the tuple `tup`. **

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality:
- If `tup` is an empty tuple, the function will return 0 as the length of the tuple.
- If the first element of `tup` is not a tuple, the function will return None without iterating through the rest of the elements.
