According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements present in the tuple `tup`. If there is at least 1 element in the tuple, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `elem` is the first element in the tuple `tup`.
State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements, some of which may be tuples, `elem` is the first element in `tup`**
