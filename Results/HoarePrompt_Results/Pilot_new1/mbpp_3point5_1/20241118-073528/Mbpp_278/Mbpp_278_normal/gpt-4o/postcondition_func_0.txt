The function func_1 accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing elements of any type. It iterates through the elements of the tuple until it encounters the first tuple element, at which point it stops iterating and returns the number of non-tuple elements it has encountered. If the tuple is empty, the function returns 0.
