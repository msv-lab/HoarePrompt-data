Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem description. The function iterates through the elements of the input tuple `tup` and stops as soon as it encounters the first tuple element. It then returns the count of non-tuple elements encountered before the tuple element. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the examples provided. The output hints also align with the code logic and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Hence, the code is correct.
