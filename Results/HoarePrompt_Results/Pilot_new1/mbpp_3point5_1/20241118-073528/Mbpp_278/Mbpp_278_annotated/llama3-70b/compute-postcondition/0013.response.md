The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing elements, where at least one element is a tuple. 

Case 1: If there is at least one tuple in `tup`, the function will loop through the elements and return the index of the first tuple encountered. If there are no tuples in `tup`, the loop will not execute, and there will be no change in the state of the program variables.

Case 2: The function returns the length of the tuple `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` containing elements, where at least one element is a tuple. It will either return the index of the first tuple encountered or the length of the tuple `tup`.
