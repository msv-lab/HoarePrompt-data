The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers with the same length. The function divides each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2` and returns a list of the results. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers with the same length, perform element-wise division between the elements of the two lists, and return a new list containing the results of the division. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers with the same length, performs element-wise division between the elements of the two lists, and returns a new list containing the results of the division.**
