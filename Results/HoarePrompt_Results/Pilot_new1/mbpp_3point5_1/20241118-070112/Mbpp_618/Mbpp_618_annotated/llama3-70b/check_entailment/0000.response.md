Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately follows the problem description. It takes two lists of numbers as input, checks if they are of the same length, and then divides each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list. The annotations also confirm that the code behaves as described in the problem description. Since there are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct.
