The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a ValueError is raised stating that both lists must be of the same length. Otherwise, the function returns a list of results obtained by dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`.
