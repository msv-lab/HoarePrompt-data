The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers. The length of `list1` is equal to the length of `list2`, and all elements in `list2` are non-zero. After executing the function body, the program returns a list of results after dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list containing the results of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`.
