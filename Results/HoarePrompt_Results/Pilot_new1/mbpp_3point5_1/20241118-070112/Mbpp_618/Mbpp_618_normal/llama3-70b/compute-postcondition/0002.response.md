Postcondition: ***list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, a ValueError is raised stating that both lists must be of the same length. Otherwise, there are no changes to the lists, and the program continues with the same lists of numbers.***
