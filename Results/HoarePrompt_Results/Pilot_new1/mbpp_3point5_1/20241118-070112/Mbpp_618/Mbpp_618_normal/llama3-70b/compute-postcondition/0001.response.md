Example Answer:
The code raises a ValueError with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. The lists list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with different lengths, so the ValueError is raised. The lists list1 and list2 are not modified by this operation.
Output State: **ValueError: Both lists must be of the same length**
