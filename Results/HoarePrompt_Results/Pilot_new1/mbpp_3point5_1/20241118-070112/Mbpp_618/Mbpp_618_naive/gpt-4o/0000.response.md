Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and divides the elements of the lists element-wise using list comprehension and the `zip` function. The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as dividing positive integers, dividing integers where the result is a float, and dividing larger numbers. In all test cases, the function returns the expected output, demonstrating that it correctly divides the elements of the lists element-wise. Since the program passes all the provided test cases and there are no potential cases identified where it would not work as expected, the correctness is True.
