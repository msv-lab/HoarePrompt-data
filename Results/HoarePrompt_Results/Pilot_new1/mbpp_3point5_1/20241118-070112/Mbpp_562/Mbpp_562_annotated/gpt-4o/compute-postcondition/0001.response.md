According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list has at least 1 sublist, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, max_length is initialized to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist and `sublist` is the first sublist in the list with its elements accessible.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list with its elements accessible, `max_length` is initialized to 0**
