Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists. `max_length` is the length of the second sublist in the list. `sublist` is the second sublist in the list. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
