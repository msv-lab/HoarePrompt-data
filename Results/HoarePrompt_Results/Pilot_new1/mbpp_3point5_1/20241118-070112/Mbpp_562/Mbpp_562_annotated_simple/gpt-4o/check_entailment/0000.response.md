Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a list of lists as input and correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the input list. It iterates through each sublist in the input list and updates the `max_length` variable if it finds a sublist with a length greater than the current `max_length`. The function then returns the length of the longest sublist. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it handles the case where the input list is empty by correctly returning 0. Since the program works as expected for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
