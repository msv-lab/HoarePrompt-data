Example Answer:
The variable `max_length` is assigned the length of the `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `list_of_lists` has at least two sublists, the length of `sublist` is guaranteed to be accessible. Therefore, the new value of `max_length` is the length of `sublist`, which is the maximum length among all sublists in `list_of_lists`.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists with at least two sublists, sublist is the second sublist in list_of_lists, max_length is the maximum length among all sublists in list_of_lists**
