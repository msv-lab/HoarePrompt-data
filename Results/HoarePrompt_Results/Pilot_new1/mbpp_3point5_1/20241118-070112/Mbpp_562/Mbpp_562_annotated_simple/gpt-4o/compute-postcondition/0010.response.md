Postcondition: ***list_of_lists is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, sublist is the third sublist in list_of_lists, max_length is the maximum length among all sublists in list_of_lists. If the length of sublist is greater than max_length, then max_length is updated to the length of sublist. In all cases, the values of list_of_lists, sublist, and max_length are maintained as described in the precondition.***
