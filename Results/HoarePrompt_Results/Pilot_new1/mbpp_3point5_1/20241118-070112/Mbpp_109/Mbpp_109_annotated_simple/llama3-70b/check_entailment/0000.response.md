Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly calculates the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. It handles the case where the input string needs to be repeated multiple times to cover the required number of rotations. The function then counts the occurrences of '1's in the substring of the repeated string and updates the count variable accordingly. The final count is returned as the output. The logic seems to align with the problem description for all potential cases.
