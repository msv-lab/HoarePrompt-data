Example Answer:
The variable `temp` is assigned the substring of `s` starting from index `i` up to index `i + len(s)`. Since `s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times, and the value of `i` is 0, `temp` will be the first `len(s)` characters of `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the first `len(s)` characters of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the first `len(s)` characters of `s`**
