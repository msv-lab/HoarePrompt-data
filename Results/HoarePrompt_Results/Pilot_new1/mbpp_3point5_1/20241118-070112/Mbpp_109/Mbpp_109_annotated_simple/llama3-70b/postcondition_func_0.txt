The function func_1 accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It then repeats the string `s` enough times to cover the range of `n`, calculates the occurrences of '1's in substrings of `s` of length equal to the length of `s`, and updates the count variable based on the parity of these occurrences. The function returns the final value of the variable 'count' after executing the loop. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and count remains 0.
