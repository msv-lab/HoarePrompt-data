Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is either 1 or 0. After execution, the new value of `count` will be either 2 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: binary_str is the updated rotated binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is either 2 or 1 based on whether the integer_value is odd or even, _ is 1, integer_value is the integer value of binary_str.
Output State: **binary_str is the updated rotated binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is either 2 or 1 based on whether the integer_value is odd or even, _ is 1, integer_value is the integer value of binary_str**
