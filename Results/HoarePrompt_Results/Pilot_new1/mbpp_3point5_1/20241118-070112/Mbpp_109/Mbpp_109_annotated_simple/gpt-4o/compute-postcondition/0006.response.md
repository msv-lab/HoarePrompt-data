Postcondition: ***binary_str is the rotated binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is either 1 or 0 based on whether the integer_value is odd or even, _ is 0, integer_value is the integer value of binary_str. If the integer_value is odd (integer_value % 2 == 1), then count is increased by 1. Otherwise, count remains unchanged at 0.***
