The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a binary string, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the program returns the updated value of 'count' based on the count of '1's in the substring of 's' starting from index 'i' to index 'i + len(s)' modulo 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the updated value of 'count' based on the count of '1's in the substring of 's' modulo 2.
