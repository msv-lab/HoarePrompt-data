Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`.
- It then repeats the binary string `s` as many times as needed to cover `n` rotations.
- It counts the number of '1's in substrings of length equal to the length of `s` modulo 2.
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.
- The code seems to follow the problem description by counting the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. 
- The output hints also correspond to the code's functionality and do not provide any contradictory information.
