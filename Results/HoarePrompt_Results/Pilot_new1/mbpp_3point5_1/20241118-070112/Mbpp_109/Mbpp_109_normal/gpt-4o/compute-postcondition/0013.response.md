Example Answer:
The code rotates the `binary_str` by moving the last character to the beginning. The new rotated binary string is updated in `binary_str`. The value of `num_rotations` remains greater than the current value. The variables `count` and `integer_value` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0, 1, or 2, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string**
