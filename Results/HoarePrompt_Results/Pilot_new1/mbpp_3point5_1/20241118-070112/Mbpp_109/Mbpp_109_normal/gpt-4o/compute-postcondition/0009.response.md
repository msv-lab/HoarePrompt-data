Example Answer:
The `integer_value` is assigned the decimal value of the `binary_str` after converting it from binary to an integer. The `num_rotations`, `count`, and `binary_str` are not affected directly by this code. If the `integer_value` turns out to be odd, then `count` will be increased by 1. 
Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0 or 1, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string, and if `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1**
