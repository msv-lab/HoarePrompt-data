Example Answer: 
The `binary_str` is rotated by moving the last character to the beginning. The `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, so the rotation continues. The `integer_value` might change based on the new `binary_str`, and if the new `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0 or 1, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string, and if `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0 or 1, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string, and if `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1**
