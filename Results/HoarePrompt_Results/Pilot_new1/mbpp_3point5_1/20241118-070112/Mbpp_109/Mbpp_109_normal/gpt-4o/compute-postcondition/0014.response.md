Example Answer:
The `integer_value` variable is assigned the decimal value of the `binary_str` after converting it from binary to decimal using `int(binary_str, 2)`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0, 1, or 2, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0, 1, or 2, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string**
