According to the code, the loop will execute based on the `num_rotations` variable. If the loop is to execute one more time, `num_rotations` must be greater than the current value. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `num_rotations` should be further increased.
State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1**.
