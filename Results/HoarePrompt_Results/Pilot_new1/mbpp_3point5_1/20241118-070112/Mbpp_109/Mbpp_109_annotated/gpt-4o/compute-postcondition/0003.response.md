Example Answer:
The binary string `binary_str` is converted to an integer value using base 2. The value of `binary_str` is rotated, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, and the value of `count` is 0. The variable `_` is in the range of `num_rotations`, but its specific value is unknown. After execution, the `integer_value` is assigned the integer value of the rotated `binary_str`.
Output State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0, `_` is in the range of `num_rotations`, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str`**
