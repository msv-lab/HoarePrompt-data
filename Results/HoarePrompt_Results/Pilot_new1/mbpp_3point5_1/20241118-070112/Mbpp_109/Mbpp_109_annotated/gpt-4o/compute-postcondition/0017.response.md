According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `_` is in the range of `num_rotations + 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is in the range of `num_rotations + 2`, `binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 3 if `integer_value` is even and 4 if `integer_value` is odd, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str`. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str`. After the if block executes, if `integer_value` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 4 if `integer_value` is even and 5 if `integer_value` is odd. All other variables maintain their initial values and relationships as described in the precondition. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 3 if `integer_value` is even and 4 if `integer_value` is odd, `_` is in the range of `num_rotations + 2`, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str`**
