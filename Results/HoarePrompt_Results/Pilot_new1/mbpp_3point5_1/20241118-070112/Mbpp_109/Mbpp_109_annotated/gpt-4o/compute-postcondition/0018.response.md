Output State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the number of times the rotated integer value is odd, `_` is in the range of `num_rotations`, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str`. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.**
