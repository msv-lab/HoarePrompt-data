Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the line `return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]`. This line is incorrect as it removes the characters between the first and last index inclusive, instead of removing the last occurrence of the character as per the problem description. This means that for cases where the character occurs multiple times in the string, the code will not produce the correct output. 

For example, if we input `func_1('hello', 'l')`, the expected output should be `'heo'` as the first and last occurrence of 'l' should be removed. However, the code will output `'heo'` as it removes all characters between the first and last occurrence of 'l' inclusive, resulting in an incorrect output.
