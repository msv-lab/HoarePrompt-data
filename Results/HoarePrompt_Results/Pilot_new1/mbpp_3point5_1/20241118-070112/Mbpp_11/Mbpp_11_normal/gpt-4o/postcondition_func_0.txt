The function func_1 takes a string `s` and a character `ch` as input. It then finds the first and last index of the character `ch` in the string `s`. If either the first index is -1, the last index is -1, or both indices are the same, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it modifies `s` by removing the character at the first index and the characters between the first and last index (inclusive).
