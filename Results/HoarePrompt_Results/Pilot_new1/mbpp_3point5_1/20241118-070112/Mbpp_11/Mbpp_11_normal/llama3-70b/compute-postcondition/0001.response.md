Example Answer:
`last_occ` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` using the `rfind()` method. If `c` is not found in `s`, `last_occ` will be assigned -1. The states of `s`, `c`, and `first_occ` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found; `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found; `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found**
