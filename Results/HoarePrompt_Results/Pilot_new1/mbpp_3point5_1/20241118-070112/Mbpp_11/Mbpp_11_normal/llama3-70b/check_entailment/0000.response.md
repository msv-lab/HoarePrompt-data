Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the code incorrectly removes all characters between the first and last occurrences of the given character, instead of removing only the first and last occurrences. This means the code does not handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the given character in the string. 

For example, if we have the input string "hello world" and we want to remove the character 'o', the expected output should be "hell world". However, the code will output "hell wrld" because it removes all occurrences of 'o' between the first and last occurrence.
