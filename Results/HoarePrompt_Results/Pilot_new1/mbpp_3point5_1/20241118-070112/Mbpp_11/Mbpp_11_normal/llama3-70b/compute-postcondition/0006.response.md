Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1, the function returns `s` with the characters at the indices `first_occ` and `last_occ` removed. Otherwise, the function returns the original string `s`.***
