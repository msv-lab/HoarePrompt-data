The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `c`, which is a character. The function also returns two values: `first_occ`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, and `last_occ`, which is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1, the function returns `s` with the characters at the indices `first_occ` and `last_occ` removed. Otherwise, the function returns the original string `s`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`. It returns the modified string `s` with characters at the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if both occurrences are found. If `c` is not found, the function returns the original string `s`.**
