Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes in a string `s` and a character `ch`. It finds the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s`, or if the first and last occurrences are the same index, the function returns the original string `s` without any alterations. If the first and last occurrences are different indices, the function returns `s` with the character at the first and last indices removed.**
