The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `c`. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` as `first_occ` or -1 if `c` is not found. It also returns the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` as `last_occ`. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1, the function returns `s` with the character at index `first_occ` and `last_occ` removed. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, the function returns the original string `s`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, returns `s` with the character at the first and last occurrence of `c` removed if both are found. Otherwise, it returns the original string `s`.**
