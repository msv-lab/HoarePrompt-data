Correctness: **False**

The given program does not fully meet the problem description. It removes the first and last occurrence of the given character, but it does not handle the case when the first and last occurrences are the same character. For example, if the input string is "hello" and the character to remove is "h", the program will not remove both occurrences of "h".
