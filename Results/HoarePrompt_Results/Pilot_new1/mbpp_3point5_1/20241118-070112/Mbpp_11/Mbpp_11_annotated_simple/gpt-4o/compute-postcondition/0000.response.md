Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `first_index`. The value of `s` is a string, and the value of `ch` is a character. The output state is: s is a string, ch is a character, first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a character, first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s**
