Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not remove the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string as described in the problem description. 

For example, if we have the input string "hello world" and we want to remove the character 'o', the expected output should be "hell wrld". However, the current implementation of the program will not provide the correct output for this case.
