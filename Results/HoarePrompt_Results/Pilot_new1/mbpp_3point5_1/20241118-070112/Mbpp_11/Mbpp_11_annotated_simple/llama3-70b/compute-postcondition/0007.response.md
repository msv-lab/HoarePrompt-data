The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` which is a string and `c` which is a character. The function also returns two values, `first_occ` which is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, and `last_occ` which is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`. 

If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1, the function returns `s` with the character at the first occurrence of `c` and the character at the last occurrence of `c` removed. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, the function returns `s` unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, find the first and last occurrences of `c` in `s`, and modify `s` by removing the characters at those positions if both occurrences are found. If either occurrence is not found, the function returns `s` unchanged.
