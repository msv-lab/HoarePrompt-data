The function `func_1` takes two parameters, a string `s` and a character `c`. It then finds the index of the first and last occurrences of `c` in `s`. If both occurrences are found, it returns `s` with the characters at those positions removed. If either occurrence is not found, the function returns the original `s` unchanged.
