Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to keep track of the index. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index position. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with `False` and -1. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem description. The function correctly determines if the element is in the array and returns the index position if found.
