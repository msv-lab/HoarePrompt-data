The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list, and `element`, which can be any data type. 

Case_1: If the `element` is present in the `arr`, the function returns True and the index of the `element` in `arr`. If the `element` is not found in `arr`, the function does not return anything.

Case_2: If the `element` is not found in `arr`, the function returns False and -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and if the `element` is present in `arr`, it returns True along with the index of the `element` in `arr`. If the `element` is not found in `arr`, it returns False and -1.
