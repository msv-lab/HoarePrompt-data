Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in an array `arr` and an element `element`, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The function then iterates through the array using the `enumerate` function to access both the index and value at each position. If the value is equal to the element, it returns a tuple with True and the index. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly handles the scenario where the element is found in the array and when it is not found. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
