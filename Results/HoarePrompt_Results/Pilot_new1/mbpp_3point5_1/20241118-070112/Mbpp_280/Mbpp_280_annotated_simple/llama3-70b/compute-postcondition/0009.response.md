Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the index of the third element in `arr`, `x` is the third element in `arr`. If `x` is equal to `elem`, the function returns True and the index `i` of the third element in `arr`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the program fragment.***
