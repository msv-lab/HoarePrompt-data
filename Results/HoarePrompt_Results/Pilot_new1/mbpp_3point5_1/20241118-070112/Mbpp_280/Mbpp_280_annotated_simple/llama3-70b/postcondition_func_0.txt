The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `elem`, which can be any data type. If `elem` is in `arr`, the function returns True along with the index of `elem` in `arr`. If `elem` is not in `arr`, it returns False and -1. The function accurately handles the cases where `elem` is in `arr` and where it is not.
