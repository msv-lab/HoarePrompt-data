Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and an element `element`. If the `element` is found in the list `arr`, the function returns True along with the index of the element. If the `element` is not found, it returns False along with the index -1. **

The code follows the annotations accurately. It checks if the `element` is present in the list `arr` and returns True with the index if found, and False with index -1 if not found.
