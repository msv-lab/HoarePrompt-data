According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, the state of the arr list does not matter. So, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element, and the index is 0 and value is the first element in the list.
State: **Precondition: arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, value is the first element in the list, index is 0**
