Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns True along with the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns False along with -1, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations also confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns True with the index if the element is present, and False with -1 if the element is not found. Since the code and annotations agree with the problem description and cover all potential cases, the correctness is True.
