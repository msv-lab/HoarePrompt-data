Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`. It iterates through the elements of `arr` and checks if `elem` is found. If `elem` is found, the function returns True along with the index `i` where `elem` is found. If `elem` is not found, the function returns False and -1. **

The code matches the annotations and covers the cases where the element is found and where it is not found.
