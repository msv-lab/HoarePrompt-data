Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes in an array `arr` and an element `elem`, then iterates through the elements of `arr` to check if `elem` is found. If `elem` is found, it returns True along with the index `i` where `elem` is found. If `elem` is not found, it returns False and -1. The annotations also confirm this behavior, stating that if `elem` is found, the loop will return True and the index `i`, and if `elem` is not found, it will return False and -1. Since the code matches the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is True.
