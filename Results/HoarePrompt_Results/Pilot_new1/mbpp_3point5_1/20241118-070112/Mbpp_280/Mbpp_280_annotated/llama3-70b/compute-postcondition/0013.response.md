The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `arr` of elements and `elem` of any data type. The function first checks if `elem` is found in `arr`. If `elem` is found, the function returns True along with the index `i` where `elem` is found. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the loop will not execute and no changes will occur to the variables. 

If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function returns False and -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `elem`, and return True with the index `i` if `elem` is found in `arr`. If `elem` is not found, the function returns False and -1.
