Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array using the `enumerate` function to check if the element is equal to any element in the array. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.

The function covers all potential cases as it iterates through the entire array and correctly returns the boolean value and index position as specified in the problem description. It handles the case where the element is not found by returning `False` and -1. Since the program works as expected for all potential cases, the correctness is True.
