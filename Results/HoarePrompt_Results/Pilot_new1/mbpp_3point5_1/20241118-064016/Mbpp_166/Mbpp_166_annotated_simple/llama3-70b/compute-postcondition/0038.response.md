According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 2, `j` is set to `i + 1` where `j` is less than the length of `nums`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 2, `j` is set to `i + 2` where `j` is less than the length of `nums`. The variable `count` has been increased by 1 if the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even.**
