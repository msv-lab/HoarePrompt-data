According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `nums` by 2, and `j` should be set to `i + 1` where `j` is less than the length of `nums`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 2, `j` is set to `i + 1` where `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
