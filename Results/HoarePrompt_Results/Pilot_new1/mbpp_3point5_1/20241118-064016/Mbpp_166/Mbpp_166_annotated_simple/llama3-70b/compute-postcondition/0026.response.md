Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. The loop iterates through all pairs of elements in `nums` starting from index `i` and `j` where `j` is greater than `i`. If the XOR result between the pair of elements is even, `count` is incremented by 1. `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, and `j` is set to `i + 1` where `j` is less than the length of `nums`. If `nums` has only 1 element, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged.**
