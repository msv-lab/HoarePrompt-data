According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `j` must be within the valid range of the list `nums`. This means that `j` should be less than the length of `nums`. Additionally, `j` is defined as `i + 1`, so `i + 1` should also be less than the length of `nums`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `i` should be less than the length of `nums` by 2, `j` should be less than the length of `nums`, and `j` should be equal to `i + 1`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 2, `j` is set to `i + 1` where `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
