Example Answer: 
`odd_pairs` is calculated by multiplying `odd_count` by `odd_count - 1` and then dividing the result by 2. The previous values of `odd_count` are known, so the calculation is straightforward. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in the list, `even_pairs` is the number of pairs that can be formed by selecting 2 even numbers from the list, and `odd_pairs` is the number of pairs that can be formed by selecting 2 odd numbers from the list.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in the list, `even_pairs` is the number of pairs that can be formed by selecting 2 even numbers from the list, and `odd_pairs` is the number of pairs that can be formed by selecting 2 odd numbers from the list**
