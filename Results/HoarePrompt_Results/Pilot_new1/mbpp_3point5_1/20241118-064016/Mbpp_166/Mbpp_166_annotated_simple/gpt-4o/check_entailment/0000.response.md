Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. It calculates the number of even and odd integers in the list and then uses combinatorial logic to count the number of pairs that can be formed. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and there are no edge cases where it does not work as expected.
