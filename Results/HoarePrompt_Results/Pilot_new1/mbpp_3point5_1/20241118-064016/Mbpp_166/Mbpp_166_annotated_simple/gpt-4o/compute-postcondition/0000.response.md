Example Answer: 
The variable `even_count` is assigned the sum of 1 for each element `x` in the list `lst` if `x` is an even number (divisible by 2). The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list**
