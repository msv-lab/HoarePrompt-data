According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, `j` is equal to `i + 3, `count` is an integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums` and `j` needs to be increased by 1. Additionally, if the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is increased by 1.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, `j` is equal to `i + 4, `count` is an integer.**
