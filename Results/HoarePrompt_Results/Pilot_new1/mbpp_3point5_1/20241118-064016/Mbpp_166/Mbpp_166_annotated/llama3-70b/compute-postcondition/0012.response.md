According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of the list `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the XOR operation between elements at indices `i` and `j` results in an even number, `count` is increased by 1, and both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is incremented by 1**
