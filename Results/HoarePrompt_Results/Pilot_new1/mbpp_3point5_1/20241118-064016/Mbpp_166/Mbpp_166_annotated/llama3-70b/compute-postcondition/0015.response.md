According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the valid range of indices in the `nums` list. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be set to `i + 1` at the start of the loop. Additionally, since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, the loop will execute if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. Therefore, the adjusted states are:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`**
