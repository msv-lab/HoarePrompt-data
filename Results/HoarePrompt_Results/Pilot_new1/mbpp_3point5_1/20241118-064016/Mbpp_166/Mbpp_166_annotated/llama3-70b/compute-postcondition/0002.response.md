According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If the list `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. The loop starts from index `i + 1`, so `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `nums` minus 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, `count` remains 0, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 1`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`**
