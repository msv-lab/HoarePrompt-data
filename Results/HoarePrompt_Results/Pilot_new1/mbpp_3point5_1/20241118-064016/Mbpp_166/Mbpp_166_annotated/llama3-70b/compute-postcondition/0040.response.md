According to the code, the loop will execute if `nums` has at least 2 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `nums` minus 2, and `j` needs to be equal to `i + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, and `j` is equal to `i + 1**.
