According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `nums` has at least 1 element. Since the loop iterates over the length of `nums`, the loop will execute if `nums` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `count` is 0. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that `nums` is not empty, and `i` is 0.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
