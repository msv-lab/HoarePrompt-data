Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `count` is incremented by 1 for each such pair. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 1. The program updates `count` based on the XOR operation between elements in `nums` satisfying the condition.***
