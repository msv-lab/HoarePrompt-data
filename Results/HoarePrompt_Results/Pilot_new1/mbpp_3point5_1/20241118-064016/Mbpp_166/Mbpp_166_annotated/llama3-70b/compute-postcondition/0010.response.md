Example Answer:
The value of `count` is increased by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` is increased by 1. The variables `i` and `j` are both incremented by 1, but their initial values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is increased by 1, `i` and `j` are both incremented by 1.
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is increased by 1, `i` and `j` are both incremented by 1**
