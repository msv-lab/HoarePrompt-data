Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `count` is incremented by 1 for each such pair. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 3. After the execution of the if statement, the count variable is updated based on the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. If the result is even, `count` is increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values. The postcondition covers all possible cases including when the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, odd, or any other edge cases that may arise.***
