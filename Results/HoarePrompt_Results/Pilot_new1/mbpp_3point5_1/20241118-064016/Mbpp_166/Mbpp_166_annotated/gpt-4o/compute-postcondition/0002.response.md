Example Answer:
`even_pairs` is calculated by multiplying `even_count` by `even_count - 1` and then dividing the result by 2. The value of `even_count` represents the count of even numbers in the list `lst`. Therefore, the output state is: lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in the list `lst`, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in the list `lst`, and even_pairs is the calculated value based on the count of even numbers.
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in the list `lst`, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in the list `lst`, and even_pairs is the calculated value based on the count of even numbers**
