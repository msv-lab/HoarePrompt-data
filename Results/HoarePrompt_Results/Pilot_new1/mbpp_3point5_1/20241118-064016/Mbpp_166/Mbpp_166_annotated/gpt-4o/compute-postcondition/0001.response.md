Example Answer:
`odd_count` is assigned the value of the length of `lst` minus `even_count`. The value of `even_count` is unknown, but it represents the count of even numbers in the list `lst`. Therefore, the output state is: lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in the list `lst`, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in the list `lst`.
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in the list `lst`, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in the list `lst`**
