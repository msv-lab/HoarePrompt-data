Example Answer:
The variable `even_pairs` is calculated by multiplying `even_count` by `even_count - 1` and then dividing the result by 2. Since we are not provided with the initial values of `even_count`, we cannot determine the exact value of `even_pairs`. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the calculated value based on the provided information.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the calculated value based on the provided information**
