According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i + 1` is less than the length of `nums`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is adjusted such that `i + 1` is less than the length of `nums`**
