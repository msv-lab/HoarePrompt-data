According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is incremented by 1 or 2, `i` is increased by 2, `j` is equal to `i + 1. If the XOR of the elements at index `i` and `j` in `nums` results in an even number, then `count` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums`. Since `j` is initially set to `i + 1`, it should be adjusted to `j` is less than the length of `nums`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is incremented by 1 or 2, `i` is increased by 2, `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
