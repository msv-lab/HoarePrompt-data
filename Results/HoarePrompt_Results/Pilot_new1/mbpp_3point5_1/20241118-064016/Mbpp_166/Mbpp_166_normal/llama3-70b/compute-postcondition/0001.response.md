According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of nums is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, count is 0 and nums is a list of integers, so to ensure the loop executes, count needs to be adjusted to 0, and i is 0.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
