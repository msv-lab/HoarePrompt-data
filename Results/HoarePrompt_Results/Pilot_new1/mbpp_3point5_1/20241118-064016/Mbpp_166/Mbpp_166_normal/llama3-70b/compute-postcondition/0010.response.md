Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `count` may have been increased based on XOR result, `j` is less than the length of `nums`.
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `count` may have been increased based on XOR result, `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
