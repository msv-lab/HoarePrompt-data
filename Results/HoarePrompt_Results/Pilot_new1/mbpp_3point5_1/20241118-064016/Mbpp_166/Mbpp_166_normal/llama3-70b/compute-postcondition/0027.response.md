According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is increased by 1**
