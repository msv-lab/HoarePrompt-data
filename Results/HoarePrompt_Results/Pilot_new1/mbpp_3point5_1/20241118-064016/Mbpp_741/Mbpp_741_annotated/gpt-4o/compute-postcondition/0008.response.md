According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string where `char` is the first character. To execute one more time, the string `s` should have at least one more character after the current `char` being processed. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `s` should have a length greater than 1.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with a length greater than 1 where `char` is the next character after the current one.**
