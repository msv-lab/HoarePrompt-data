The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. 
Case_1: If `s` is an empty string, the function returns True. 
Case_2: If `s` is not empty, the function iterates through each character in `s`. If any character is not equal to the first character of `s`, the function returns False. If `s` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and the function will return False.
Case_3: The function always returns True after the loop, regardless of the content of the string `s`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to always return True.
