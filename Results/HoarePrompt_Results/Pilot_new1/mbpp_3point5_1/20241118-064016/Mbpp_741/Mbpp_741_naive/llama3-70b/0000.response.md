Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if all the characters in the string are the same, otherwise it returns `False`. The code uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicates from the string, and then checks if the length of the set is equal to 1. If all characters are the same, the length of the set will be 1, else it will be greater than 1. This logic covers all potential cases where the characters are either the same or not the same. Since the code correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and there are no potential cases identified where it fails, the correctness is True.
