Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. The function has three cases:

Case 1: If `s` is an empty string, the function returns True.

Case 2: If `s` is a non-empty string and the first character of `s` is `first_char`, then the function will loop through each character in `s`. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function will return False. If `s` is an empty string or the first character of `s` is not equal to `first_char`, the function will return False.

Case 3: The function always returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return True if `s` is empty. If `s` is a non-empty string and the first character is `first_char`, the function will check if all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char` and return True. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function will return False.**
