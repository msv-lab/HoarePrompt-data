Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code appears to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same, which is exactly what the code is doing by checking if the length of the set of characters in the string is equal to 1. This logic correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description. The output hints also align with the code, confirming that it is correct.
