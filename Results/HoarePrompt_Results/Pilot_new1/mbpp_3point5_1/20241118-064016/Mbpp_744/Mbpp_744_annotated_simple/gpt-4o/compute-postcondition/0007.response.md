According to the code, the loop will execute again if the tuple `tup` has more items left to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 items. So for the loop to execute one more time, the tuple `tup` must have at least 3 items.
State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 3 items**
