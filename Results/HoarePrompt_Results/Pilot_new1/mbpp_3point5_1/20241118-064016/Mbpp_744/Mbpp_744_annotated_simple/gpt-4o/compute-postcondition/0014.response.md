Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. It iterates through the tuple and checks if any item is None. If it finds a None item, the function returns True. If the tuple is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns False. If the tuple is not empty and does not contain None, the function returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to check if a tuple contains None and return True in that case, otherwise return False.**
