The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. 

Case_1: If `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item, the function will iterate through the tuple. If any `item` in `tup` is None, the function will return True and the iteration will stop. If no `item` is None, the iteration will finish without any changes to the state of `tup`. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the iteration will not execute.

Case_2: The function returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup`, iterate through the tuple checking for the presence of None, and return True if any item is None. If no item is None, it returns False. If `tup` is empty, the function does not perform any iteration and returns False.
