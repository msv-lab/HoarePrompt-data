Output State: **If `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item, the loop will iterate through the tuple. If any `item` in `tup` is None, the function will return True and the loop will stop. If no `item` is None, the loop will finish without any changes to the state of `tup`. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the loop will not execute.**
