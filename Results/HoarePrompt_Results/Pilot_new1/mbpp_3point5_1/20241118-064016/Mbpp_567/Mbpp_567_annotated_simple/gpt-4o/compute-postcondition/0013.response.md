The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements that can be compared for sorting. If `lst` has at least 2 elements, the function checks if any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If this condition is met, the function returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the list is already sorted, the function does not return anything. If `lst` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return anything.

In addition, the function returns True in Case_2, indicating that the list is sorted. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and check if it is sorted. If the list is not sorted, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True. If the list has less than 2 elements, the function does not return anything. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of elements `lst` and checks if it is sorted. If the list is not sorted, it returns False. If the list is sorted, it returns True. If the list has less than 2 elements, the function does not return anything.**
