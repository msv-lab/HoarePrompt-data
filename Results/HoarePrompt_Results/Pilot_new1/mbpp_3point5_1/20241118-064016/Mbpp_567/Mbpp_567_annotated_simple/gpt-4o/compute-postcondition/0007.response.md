According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is an index less than the length of `lst` minus 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next index. If the element at index `i` in `lst` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, then the function returns False, but in this case, we only need to focus on adjusting `i`.
State: **`lst` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is an index less than the length of `lst` minus 1**
