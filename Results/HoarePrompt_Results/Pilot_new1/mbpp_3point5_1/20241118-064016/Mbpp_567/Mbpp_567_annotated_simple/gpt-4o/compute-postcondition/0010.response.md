According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list with at least 2 elements and `i` is an index less than the length of `lst` minus 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `lst` minus 2, as `i` is currently less than the length of `lst` minus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`lst` is a list with at least 2 elements and `i` is an index less than the length of `lst` minus 2**
