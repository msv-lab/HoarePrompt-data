Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list with at least 2 elements and `i` is an index less than the length of `lst` minus 1. If `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False. In all other cases where `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]`, the program does not modify the list or any other variables.***
