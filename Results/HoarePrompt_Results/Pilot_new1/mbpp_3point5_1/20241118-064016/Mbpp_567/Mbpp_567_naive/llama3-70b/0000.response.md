Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If the next element is smaller or equal to the current one, it continues to the next pair of elements. If at any point the next element is larger than the current one, it returns False. This logic covers all potential cases and correctly determines whether the list is sorted or not.
