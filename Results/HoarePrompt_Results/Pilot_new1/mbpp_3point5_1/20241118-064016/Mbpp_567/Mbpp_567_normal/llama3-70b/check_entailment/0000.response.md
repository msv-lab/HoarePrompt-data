Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and returns True if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If any element is greater than the subsequent element, it returns False. The code handles the case where the input list is empty since the range in the list comprehension will be empty in that case. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description, and there are no edge cases identified where the code would not work as expected.
