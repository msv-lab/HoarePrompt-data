The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. The list `lst` must have a length of at least 2 for the loop to execute. During the loop, if any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns False. If the loop completes without any such comparison, the function returns True. If the length of `lst` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and the function returns True.
