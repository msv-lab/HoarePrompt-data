Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, the function returns True, indicating that the list is sorted. The function logic is correct and covers all potential cases where the list is not sorted.
