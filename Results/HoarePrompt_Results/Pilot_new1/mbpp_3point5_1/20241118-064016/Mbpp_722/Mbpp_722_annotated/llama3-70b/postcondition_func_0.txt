The function func_1 accepts three parameters: student_data, min_height, and min_weight. It then creates a dictionary that includes only the students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. However, the code provided is incomplete as there is a syntax error in the return statement. It seems that the code intends to filter out students based on their height and weight, but due to the syntax error, it will not function as expected.
