The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a student name (string) and each value is a tuple of two floats (student_height, student_weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter out and return a dictionary of students from the input `student_data` whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: student_data, min_height, and min_weight. It returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
