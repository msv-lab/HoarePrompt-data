The function func_1 accepts a dictionary `student_data`, minimum height `min_height`, and minimum weight `min_weight`. It then returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with each key being the student name and the corresponding value being a tuple of their height and weight. However, it seems that there is a syntax error in the code where the dictionary comprehension is not closed properly, potentially causing a syntax error when the function is executed.
