The function func_1 accepts a dictionary of student information, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It then filters the students based on the condition that their height is greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight is greater than or equal to the minimum weight. The function returns a dictionary containing only the students meeting these criteria, along with their corresponding height and weight values.
