The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. It filters the `student_data` dictionary based on the criteria that the student's height must be greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight must be greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The function then returns a new dictionary with only the students meeting these criteria, where the student names are keys and their corresponding height and weight are values.
