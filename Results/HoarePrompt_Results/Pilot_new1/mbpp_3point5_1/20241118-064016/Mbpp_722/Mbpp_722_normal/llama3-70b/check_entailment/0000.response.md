Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to follow the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `student_data`, along with `min_height` and `min_weight` as parameters. It filters the `student_data` dictionary based on the criteria that the student's height must be greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight must be greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The function then returns a new dictionary with only the students meeting these criteria, where the student names are keys and their corresponding height and weight are values.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, there doesn't seem to be any edge cases or scenarios where the code would not work as expected. The logic of filtering students based on height and weight requirements is implemented correctly. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, further supporting the conclusion that the code is correct.
