The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. **Precondition**: `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a student name (string) and each value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight. `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with the student names as keys and their corresponding height and weight as values. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `student_data`, along with minimum height (`min_height`) and minimum weight (`min_weight`) values, and return a filtered dictionary containing only students who meet the height and weight criteria specified.
