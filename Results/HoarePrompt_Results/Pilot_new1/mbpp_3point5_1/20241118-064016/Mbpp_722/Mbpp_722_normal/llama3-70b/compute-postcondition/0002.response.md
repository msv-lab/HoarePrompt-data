Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. It filters the `student_data` dictionary based on the criteria that the student's height must be greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight must be greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The function then returns a new dictionary with only the students meeting these criteria, where the student names are keys and their corresponding height and weight are values.**

The code accurately filters the student data based on height and weight criteria as specified in the annotations. It creates a new dictionary with only the students meeting the conditions. However, one potential edge case not covered in the annotations is when `student_data` is empty or does not contain any students that meet the height and weight criteria. This case should be considered to provide a comprehensive summary of the function's functionality.
