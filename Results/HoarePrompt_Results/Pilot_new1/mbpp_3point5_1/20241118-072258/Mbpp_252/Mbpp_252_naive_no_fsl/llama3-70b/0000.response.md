Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function that correctly converts a complex number to polar coordinates using the `abs` function to calculate the magnitude and the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase angle. The program does not have any edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
