Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns a tuple containing the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`. The code aligns with the problem description as it accurately converts complex numbers to polar coordinates by calculating the absolute value and phase. Additionally, the output hints confirm this behavior by stating that the function returns the absolute value and phase of the input complex number. 

Since the code correctly implements the conversion of complex numbers to polar coordinates as described in the problem statement and the output hints validate this behavior, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
