Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to follow the problem description correctly. The function `func_1` takes a complex number `num` as input and returns its polar coordinates (r, phi) using the cmath library. The assertions provided in the code also seem to match the expected output based on the problem description. Additionally, since the code utilizes the cmath library to calculate the polar coordinates of a complex number, it is likely to handle edge cases and complex numbers accurately. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.
