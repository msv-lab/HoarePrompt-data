Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program defines a function that takes a complex number as input and returns its polar coordinates. The code utilizes the `cmath.polar()` function to convert the complex number to polar coordinates, which aligns with the problem description. Since the code follows the requirements and there are no potential cases identified where it would not work as expected, the program is correct.
