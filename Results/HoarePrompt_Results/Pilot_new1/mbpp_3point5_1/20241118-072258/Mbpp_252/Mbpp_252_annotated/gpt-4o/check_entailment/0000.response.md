Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function that takes a complex number as input and returns its polar coordinates using the cmath library, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations also confirm that the program returns the polar coordinates of the input complex number. Since the code matches the problem description and the annotations, and there are no cases provided where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
