Correctness: **True**

The code defines a function that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them using the `max()` function. The problem description asks for a function to find the maximum of two numbers, which is exactly what the code does. The annotations also confirm that the program returns the maximum value between integers `a` and `b`. Since the code aligns perfectly with the problem description and the annotations, and there are no edge cases provided where the code might fail, we can conclude that the code is correct.
