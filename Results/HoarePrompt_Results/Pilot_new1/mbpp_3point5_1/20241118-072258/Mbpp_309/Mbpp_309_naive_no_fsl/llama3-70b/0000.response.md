Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the maximum of the two numbers using the built-in `max` function. This implementation correctly follows the problem description and will return the maximum of the two input numbers in all cases. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program would not work as expected.
