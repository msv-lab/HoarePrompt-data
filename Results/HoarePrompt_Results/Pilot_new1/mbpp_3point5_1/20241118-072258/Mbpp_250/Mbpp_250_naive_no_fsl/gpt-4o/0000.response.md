Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. The provided test cases cover scenarios where the element is not present in the tuple, where the element appears multiple times, and where the element appears only once. The function returns the correct count of occurrences in each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
