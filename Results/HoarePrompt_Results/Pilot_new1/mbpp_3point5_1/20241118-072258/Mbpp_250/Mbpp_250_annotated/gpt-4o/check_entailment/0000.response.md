Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and then returns the number of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`. The code annotations also confirm that the program returns the count of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple.

Based on the problem description and the code annotations, it is evident that the code meets the requirements and correctly implements the functionality of counting the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected, and all examples align with the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the code is determined to be **True**.
