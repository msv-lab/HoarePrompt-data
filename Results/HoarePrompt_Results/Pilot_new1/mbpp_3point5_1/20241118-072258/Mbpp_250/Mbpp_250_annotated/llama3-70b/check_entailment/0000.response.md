Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and then returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The code annotations also confirm that this is the intended functionality of the program. Additionally, there are no edge cases or potential scenarios mentioned in the annotations that are not covered by the code. Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations, the program is correct.
