The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `element`, which can be any data type. The function returns the number of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and return the number of times `element` appears in `tup`.
