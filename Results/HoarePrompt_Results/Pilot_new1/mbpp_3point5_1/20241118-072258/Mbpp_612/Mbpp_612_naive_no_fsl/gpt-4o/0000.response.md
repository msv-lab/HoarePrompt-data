Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The function then uses list comprehension to extract the first and second elements separately and return them as a list of lists.

The provided test cases cover a variety of input scenarios:
1. Input with strings as elements: [['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']] - Expected output: [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]
2. Input with integers as elements: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]] - Expected output: [[1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]]
3. Input with lists as elements: [[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]], [[5], [6]], [[7], [8]]] - Expected output: [[[1], [3], [5], [7]], [[2], [4], [6], [8]]

All the provided test cases pass successfully, and the function implementation aligns with the problem description for all potential cases. Hence, the code is correct.
