Example Answer:
The code creates a new list `first_elements` by extracting the first element from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements, `first_elements` will contain all the first elements of each sublist. The original list `list_of_lists` remains unchanged.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing all the first elements of each sublist in list_of_lists**
