Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It is supposed to return a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. However, the program is returning two separate lists instead of a list of two lists. 

Example:
Input: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
Expected Output: [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]
Actual Output: [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]

The program is incorrect as it does not return the expected output format.
