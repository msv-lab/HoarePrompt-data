The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the program returns a list containing all the first elements of the sublists and a list containing all the second elements of the sublists. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of lists `list_of_lists` and return two lists—one containing all the first elements of the sublists and another containing all the second elements of the sublists.
