Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to return a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second list has the second element of each sublist. However, the code provided returns two separate lists, one containing all the first elements and the other containing all the second elements. This does not match the expected output as per the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
