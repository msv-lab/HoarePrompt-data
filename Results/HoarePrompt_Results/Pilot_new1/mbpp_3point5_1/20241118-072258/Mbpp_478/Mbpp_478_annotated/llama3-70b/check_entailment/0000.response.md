Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. The code achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string and only keeping the characters that are uppercase using the `isupper()` method. The annotations also confirm that the program returns a new string consisting of only the uppercase characters from the original string 's'. 

After reviewing the code and the annotations, it is evident that the code aligns with the problem description and correctly implements the functionality of removing lowercase substrings from the given string. Additionally, there are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that are not handled by the code. Therefore, the code can be considered correct.
