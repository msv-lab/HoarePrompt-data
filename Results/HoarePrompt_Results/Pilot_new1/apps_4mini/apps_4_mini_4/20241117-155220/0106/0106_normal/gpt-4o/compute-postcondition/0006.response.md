Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are values returned by `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are values returned by `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1, which accounts for all possible values of `floor_a` greater than 1.***
