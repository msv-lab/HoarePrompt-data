To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description thoroughly.

### Problem Description:
The problem involves calculating the minimal time required for Edward to reach Natasha in a round building with multiple entrances, floors, and apartments. The movement involves using stairs or an elevator, and there are specific time costs associated with each type of movement.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**: 
   - This function calculates the block and floor based on the apartment number.
   - It uses integer division and modulo operations to derive the block and floor, which seems correct for the given problem description.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - It extracts the block and floor for both apartments `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the time to exit the current floor, the walking time between blocks (either directly or in reverse), and the time to reach the target floor.
   - The logic for calculating the walking time accounts for the circular nature of the building.

### Output Hints:
- The output hints describe the functionality of both functions correctly. They state that the first function calculates the time to exit, the walking time, and the time to reach the target floor, and the second function returns the block and floor for a given apartment number.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Floor 1 Handling**: The code correctly handles the case when Edward is already on the first floor (`floor_a == 1`), setting `time_to_exit` to 0.
2. **Circular Movement**: The walking time is calculated using the modulo operation to account for the circular nature of the entrances, which is appropriate.
3. **Global Variables**: The `get_location` function relies on `m` and `k` being globally defined, which could lead to issues if they are not set. This is a potential edge case that could cause errors, especially if the function is called independently.

### Conclusion:
While the code logic appears to handle the main requirements of the problem description, the reliance on global variables (`m` and `k`) in the `get_location` function is a significant flaw. If `m` and `k` are not defined globally before calling `get_location`, it will lead to errors. This is a case where the program does not work correctly according to the description, as it assumes certain variables are always available.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the apartment number is less than 1, which could yield unexpected results. 

Given these considerations, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
