To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. **Understanding the Structure**: 
   - The building has `n` blocks (entrances), each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments.
   - The apartments are numbered sequentially across the blocks and floors.
   - Edward's and Natasha's apartments are given by numbers `a` and `b`, respectively.

2. **Location Calculation**:
   - The function `get_location(apartment)` correctly calculates the block (entrance) and floor for a given apartment number using integer division and modulus operations.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the time it takes for Edward to reach the ground floor from his current floor using the lift. If he is on the first floor, the time is zero; otherwise, it includes the lift waiting time and the time taken to descend.
   - The program calculates the time required to walk to Natasha's block both clockwise and counterclockwise and chooses the minimum.
   - Finally, it calculates the time to reach Natasha's floor after arriving at her block.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not account for the scenario where both apartments are on the same floor. In this case, Edward would not need to ascend or descend any floors after reaching Natasha's block.
   - The calculation for the walking time between blocks does not consider that if Edward is in block `n` and Natasha is in block `1`, it should calculate the time correctly for both directions.
   - The time to ascend or descend to the target floor should only be added if Edward is not already on that floor after arriving at Natasha's block.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the case where `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`, `a = 1`, and `b = 2`. Edward is in apartment 1 (block 1, floor 1), and Natasha is in apartment 2 (block 2, floor 1). The expected time should be 15 seconds, as he only needs to walk to the next block. However, the program would incorrectly calculate the time to exit and then add unnecessary floor time, leading to an incorrect result.

Given the above analysis, the program does not handle all cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
