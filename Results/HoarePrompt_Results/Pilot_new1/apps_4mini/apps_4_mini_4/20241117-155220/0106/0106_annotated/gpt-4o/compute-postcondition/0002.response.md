The variable `floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, and since `k` is a positive integer, the division `floor_within_block // k` will yield a non-negative integer. The addition of 1 indicates that the floor number starts from 1 instead of 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` also remain distinct integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`**
