To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description carefully.

### Problem Description Breakdown
1. **Building Structure**: The building has:
   - `n` entrances (blocks).
   - Each entrance has `m` floors.
   - Each floor has `k` apartments.
   - Total apartments = `n * m * k`.

2. **Apartment Numbering**: Apartments are numbered sequentially:
   - The first apartment in the first entrance is 1.
   - The first apartment on the second floor of the first entrance is `k + 1`.
   - The first apartment in the second entrance is `(m * k) + 1`, and so on.

3. **Movement Times**:
   - Moving between floors (up or down) takes 5 seconds.
   - Moving between entrances takes 15 seconds.
   - The elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor.

4. **Edward's Movement**: Edward can exit only from the first floor of his entrance.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
   - This function calculates the entrance (block) and floor based on the apartment number. It seems to correctly identify the block and floor using integer division and modulus operations.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - It retrieves the locations of Edward and Natasha using `get_location`.
   - It calculates `time_to_exit` based on whether Edward is on the first floor or not.
   - It calculates the time to walk directly or in reverse between entrances.
   - Finally, it adds the time to reach Natasha's floor.

### Potential Issues
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the scenario where `a` and `b` are on the same floor in the same entrance. In this case, if Edward is already at the same entrance and floor as Natasha, the program should return 0 seconds, but it does not account for this explicitly.
- **Calculation of Walking Times**: The walking time calculation assumes that the entrances are circular, but the modulo operations might not cover all edge cases accurately, especially if `block_a` is 1 and `block_b` is `n`. 

### Example Case
Consider the input:
```
1 1 1
1 2
```
Here, Edward is in apartment 1, and Natasha is in apartment 2. The program should return an output indicating that it is impossible for Edward to reach Natasha since they are in different apartments. However, since the apartments are distinct and only one entrance exists, the program will incorrectly calculate time based on the logic provided.

### Conclusion
The program does not account for all potential edge cases, particularly when both Edward and Natasha are in the same entrance or on the same floor. Thus, it fails to meet the problem description's requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
