Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, and `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `b_floor`, `a_block`, `b_block` are calculated integer values. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In both cases, `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15, ensuring that `min_block_time` accounts for the absolute difference in blocks and the wrap-around condition based on `n`.***
