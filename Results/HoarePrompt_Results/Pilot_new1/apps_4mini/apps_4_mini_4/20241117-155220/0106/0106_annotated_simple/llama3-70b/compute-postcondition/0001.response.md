The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which accepts two integers separated by a space. The `map(int, input().split())` function converts these two inputs into integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and we have no prior values for `a` and `b` since they are determined by user input. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned integer values from input, where 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are assigned integer values from input.**
