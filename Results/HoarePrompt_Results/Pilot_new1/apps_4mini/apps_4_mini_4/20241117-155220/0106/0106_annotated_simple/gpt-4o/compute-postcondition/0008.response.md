The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the value of `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The values of `block_a` and `block_b` are derived from the function `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)`, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, we can only express the result in terms of the variables involved. 

The calculation involves:
1. The absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` is taken.
2. This difference is subtracted from `n`.
3. The result is taken modulo `n`.
4. Finally, this value is multiplied by 15 to get `reverse_walk_time`.

Since `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot specify a concrete numerical value for `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values from `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15.**
