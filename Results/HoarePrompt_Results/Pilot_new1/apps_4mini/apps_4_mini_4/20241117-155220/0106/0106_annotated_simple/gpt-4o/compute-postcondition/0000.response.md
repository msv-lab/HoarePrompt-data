To determine the output state based on the given initial state and code, we need to analyze the assignment statement.

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 1000.
   - `a` and `b` are integers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`, and `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - The variable `apartment` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code calculates the variable `block` using the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
   - Since `apartment` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot compute a specific value for `block`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The output state will reflect that `block` is calculated based on the undefined variable `apartment`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `block` is calculated based on the undefined variable `apartment`.**
