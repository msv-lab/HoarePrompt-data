Functionality: ** The function accepts five parameters: positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and distinct integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the total time required to exit from the location represented by `a` to the location represented by `b`, considering the time to exit the floor, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The total time is computed as the sum of the time to exit, the minimum walking time (either direct or reverse), and the time to reach the target floor.**
