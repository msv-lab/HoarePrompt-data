To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its implications based on the initial state.

1. The code snippet involves a `print` statement that outputs the result of `min_block_time + min_floor_time`.
2. The initial state mentions that `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`. Depending on their values, it can either be `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` or `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.
3. The `min_block_time` is calculated using the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`, which accounts for the absolute difference in block values and a wrap-around condition based on `n`.
4. Since the initial state indicates that all variables are integers and calculated values, we assume that `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` will yield specific integer results based on their respective calculations.

Thus, the output state will summarize the values of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` as they are printed together.

Output State: **`min_block_time` is calculated based on block values, `min_floor_time` is calculated based on floor values, and the total is printed.**
