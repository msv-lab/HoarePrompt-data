To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to ensure that it accurately calculates the minimum time Edward takes to reach Natasha's apartment based on the problem description.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
   - This function calculates which block (entrance) and floor Edward or Natasha lives on based on their apartment number.
   - The calculations appear to be correct, as it divides the apartment number to determine the block and floor.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the time it takes for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
   - It first determines Edward's location (block and floor) and Natasha's location.
   - It calculates the time to exit the building based on Edward's floor:
     - If he is on the first floor, it takes 0 seconds to exit.
     - If he is on a higher floor, it takes 10 seconds for the elevator to arrive and then `(floor_a - 1)` seconds to descend to the first floor.
   - It calculates the time required to walk to Natasha's block, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
   - Finally, it adds the time to ascend to Natasha's floor.

### Potential Issues:
- The calculation of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` uses the formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`. This is meant to account for the circular nature of the building, but it does not correctly handle the case where `block_a` is greater than `block_b` when walking counterclockwise. The modulo operation could lead to incorrect calculations in certain scenarios.
  
- Specifically, if Edward is in block 1 and Natasha is in block n, the calculation will yield a time that does not account for the correct distance when walking counterclockwise.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the input:
```
n = 3, m = 1, k = 5
a = 1, b = 5
```
- Edward is in block 1, floor 1 (apartment 1).
- Natasha is in block 1, floor 1 (apartment 5).
- The expected time to reach Natasha is 0 seconds since they are on the same floor. However, the program calculates the walking time incorrectly due to the flawed logic in determining the minimum walking time.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues with the walking time calculation, particularly due to the circular nature of the building, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
