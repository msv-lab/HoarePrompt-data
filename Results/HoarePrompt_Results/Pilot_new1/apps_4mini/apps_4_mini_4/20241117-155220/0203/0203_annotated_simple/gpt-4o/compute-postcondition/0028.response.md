The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` has one less element than before, it implies that there was at least one element to pop. The state of `r_queue` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, after executing the code, `d_queue` will have one less element, and `d_index` will hold the value of the element that was removed from the front of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has at least one element, and `d_index` is the value of the popped element from `d_queue`.**
