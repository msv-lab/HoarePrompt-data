According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `fractions` string. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more character left in the `fractions` string after the last iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `fractions` is a non-empty string, and we have processed at least one character. However, we need to determine how many characters have been processed and how many remain.

If `n` is the length of the `fractions` string, and since we know that `n` is a positive integer, we need to adjust the state to reflect that one more character must be processed. Therefore, we need to set `n` to be greater than 1, indicating that there are still characters left in the string for the loop to continue executing.

Additionally, we need to adjust the state of `fraction` to reflect the next character that will be processed in the next iteration. If we denote the current index of the character being processed as `index`, then we will set `fraction` to be the character at `index + 1`.

Thus, the adjusted states would be:
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 1.
- `fraction` should be set to the next character in the `fractions` string.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `fraction` is the next character in the string**
