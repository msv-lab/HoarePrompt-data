The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` has at least 1 element, this operation will successfully retrieve and remove that element. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `d_queue` and the assignment to `d_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has at least 1 element, and `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`**.
