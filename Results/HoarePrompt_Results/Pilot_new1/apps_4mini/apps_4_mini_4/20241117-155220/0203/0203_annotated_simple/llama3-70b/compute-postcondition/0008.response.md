The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `remocrats` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, and `fraction` is not equal to 'D'**
