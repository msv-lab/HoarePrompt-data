The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The initial state specifies that `i` is equal to `n`, which is an input integer between 1 and 200,000. The variable `v` is undefined but is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `d_queue` after appending `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is `n`, and `d_queue` now contains `n`**
