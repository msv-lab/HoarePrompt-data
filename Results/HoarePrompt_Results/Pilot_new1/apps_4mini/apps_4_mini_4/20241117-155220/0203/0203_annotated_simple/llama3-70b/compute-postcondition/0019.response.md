Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', and `n` is the total length of `fractions`. If `fractions` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are 0.**
