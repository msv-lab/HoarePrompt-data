Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of all 'R' characters in `votes`. If `votes` is an empty string, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. The loop will execute `n` times where `n` is the length of `votes`, and if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute at all.**
