Output State: **If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, the loop will execute until one of them is empty. After the loop, `d_queue` and `r_queue` will have fewer elements than initially, depending on the comparisons made between `d_index` and `r_index`. If `n` is 0 (i.e., `votes` is an empty string), the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `d_queue` was initially empty or became empty during execution, the loop will terminate, and `r_queue` will contain the remaining elements, if any. Conversely, if `r_queue` was initially empty or became empty during execution, the loop will terminate, and `d_queue` will contain the remaining elements, if any.**
