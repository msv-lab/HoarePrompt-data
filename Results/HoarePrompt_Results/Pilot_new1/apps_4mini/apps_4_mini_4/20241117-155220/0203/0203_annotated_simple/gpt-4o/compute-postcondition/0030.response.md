The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` has one less element, but the specific values of `d_index` and `n` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value being appended to `d_queue`. However, we can state that the operation modifies `d_queue` by adding a new element based on the calculation of `d_index + n`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (the value `d_index + n` is appended), `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the value of the popped element from `r_queue`**
