Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` have one element less than before. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has one more element, which is `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` has one less element and now has an additional element, which is `r_index + n`. In either case, `r_index` retains the value of the popped element from `r_queue`.***
