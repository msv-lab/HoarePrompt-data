Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one less element, and `r_queue` remains unchanged. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has one more element with the value `d_index + n` appended. Otherwise, `r_queue` has `r_index + n` appended to it, and `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue`, while `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `r_queue`, with the condition that `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`. An error occurs if `d_queue` was empty.***
