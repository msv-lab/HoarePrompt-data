Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `votes`, `i` is `n`, and `v` is `votes[n]`. If `v` is equal to 'D', then `i` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, `i` is appended to `r_queue`. This ensures that all possible values of `v` are accounted for, including cases where `v` may not be 'D', thus guaranteeing that `i` is correctly categorized into either `d_queue` or `r_queue`.***
