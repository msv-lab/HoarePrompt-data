The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and the parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. After executing the function body, it returns a result based on the input string `votes`. 

The specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided information, so we will focus on the parameters and their constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `votes` and return a result based on the content of `votes`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
