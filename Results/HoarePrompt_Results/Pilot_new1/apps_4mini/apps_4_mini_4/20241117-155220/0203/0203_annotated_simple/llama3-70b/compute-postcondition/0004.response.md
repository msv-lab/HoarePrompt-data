According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. For the loop to execute, the `fractions` string must contain at least one character. Additionally, since `depublicans` and `remocrats` are initialized to 0, they will remain unchanged at the start of the loop. The variable `fraction` will take on the value of the first character in the `fractions` string during the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `fractions` must not be an empty string, and `fraction` will be the first character of the `fractions` string.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`**
