Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is non-empty, and `r_queue` may be either empty or non-empty. The loop will execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will have fewer elements than initially, depending on the comparisons made between `d_index` and `r_index`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `r_queue` becomes empty during execution, `d_queue` will contain the remaining elements, if any. Conversely, if `d_queue` becomes empty during execution, `r_queue` will contain the remaining elements, if any.***
