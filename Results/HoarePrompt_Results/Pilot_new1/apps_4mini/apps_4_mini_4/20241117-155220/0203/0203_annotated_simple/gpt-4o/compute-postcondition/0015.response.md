The code `d_queue.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is equal to `n`, which is the length of `votes`. However, the values of `votes` and `d_queue` are not provided. The operation does not change the values of `n`, `i`, or `v`, but it modifies the `d_queue` by appending `i` to it. Therefore, the output state reflects that `d_queue` has been updated with the new value.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `votes`, `i` is `n`, `v` is `votes[n]`, and `d_queue` has been updated with the value of `i`.**
