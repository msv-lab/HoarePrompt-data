According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `fractions` string and the current position in the string. Since `fraction` represents the next character in the string, we need to consider the current state.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `n` is greater than 1, and `fraction` is the next character in the string. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more character left in the `fractions` string after the current `fraction`.

Given that `fraction` is the next character, it implies that the current index is `i`, where `i < n`. To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, meaning that `fraction` should be the next character after the current one.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one more character left in the string, which means `n` should remain the same, and `fraction` should represent the next character after the current one. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 and `n` is greater than 1; `fractions` is a string of length `n`, and `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one.**
