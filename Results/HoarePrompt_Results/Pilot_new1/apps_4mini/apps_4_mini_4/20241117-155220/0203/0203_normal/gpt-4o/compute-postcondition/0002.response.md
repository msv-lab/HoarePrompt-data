The line `d_queue = []` initializes an empty list called `d_queue`. This does not affect the existing variable `n` or the string `votes`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `d_queue` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is an empty list**
