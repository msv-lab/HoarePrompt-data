The value of `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue` by using the `pop(0)` method, which removes that element from `d_queue`. This operation modifies `d_queue`, reducing its length by one. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes in `d_queue` and the assignment to `d_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` remains unchanged**
