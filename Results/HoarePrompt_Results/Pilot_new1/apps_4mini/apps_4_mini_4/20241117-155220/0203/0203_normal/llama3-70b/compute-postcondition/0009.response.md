Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n`. If `fraction` (the first character of `fractions`) is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1, resulting in 1, and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is not 'D', then `depublicans` remains 0, and `remocrats` is incremented by 1, resulting in 1.***
