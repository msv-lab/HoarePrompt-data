Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 and `n` is greater than 1; `fractions` is a string of length `n`, and `fraction` is the next character in the string. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `remocrats` is increased by 1. This ensures that one of the two counters (`depublicans` or `remocrats`) is incremented based on the value of `fraction`.***
