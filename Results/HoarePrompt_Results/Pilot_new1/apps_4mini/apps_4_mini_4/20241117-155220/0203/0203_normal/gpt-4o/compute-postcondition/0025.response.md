The value of `r_index` is used to calculate the new value to be appended to `r_queue`. Since `n` is not specified, it is treated as a variable that can hold any value. The `r_index` is added to `n`, and the result is appended to `r_queue`. The state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` is affected by adding one new element to `r_queue`, but their previous sizes are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `r_queue` and the relationship between `d_index` and `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` is one element smaller, `r_index` is the value of the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, and a new element `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`.**
