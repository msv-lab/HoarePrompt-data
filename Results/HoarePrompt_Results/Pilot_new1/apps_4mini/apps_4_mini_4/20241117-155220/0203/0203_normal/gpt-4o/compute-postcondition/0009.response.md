Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. If the first character of `votes`, `v`, is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the index 0, and `r_queue` remains empty. If `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the index 0, and `d_queue` remains empty.***
