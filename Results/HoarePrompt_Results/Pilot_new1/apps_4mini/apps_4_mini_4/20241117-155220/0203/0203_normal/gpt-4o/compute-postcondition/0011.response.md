The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue` list. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, the value appended will be `n - 1`. The initial state does not affect the other variables, and `d_queue` will now contain one additional element. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` now includes `n - 1`, `r_queue` is a list, `i` is `n - 1`**
