The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. The other variables, `n` and `fractions`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, and `depublicans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0**
