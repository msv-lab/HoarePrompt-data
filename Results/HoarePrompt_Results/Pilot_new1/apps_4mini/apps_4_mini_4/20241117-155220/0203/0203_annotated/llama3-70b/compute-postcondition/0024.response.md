Postcondition: ***`depublicans` and `remocrats` are non-negative integers representing the counts of 'D' characters and non-'D' characters in `fractions`, respectively. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed. If `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, 'R' is printed. In the case where `fractions` is an empty string, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0, and no output is generated.***
