The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to the `d_queue`. The variable `d_index` holds the second element of the original `d_queue`, and `n` is an unknown value. The state of `r_index` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `d_queue` and the unchanged values of `d_index` and `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_index` is the second element of the original `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, `d_queue` is updated to include `d_index + n`**
