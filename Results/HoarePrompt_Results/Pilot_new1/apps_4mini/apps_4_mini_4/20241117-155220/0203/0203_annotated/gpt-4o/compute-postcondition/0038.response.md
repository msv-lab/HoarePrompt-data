Postcondition: ***`d_index` is the second element of the original `d_queue` and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is updated to include `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is updated to include `r_index + n`. The value of `r_index` is updated to the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it is removed.***
