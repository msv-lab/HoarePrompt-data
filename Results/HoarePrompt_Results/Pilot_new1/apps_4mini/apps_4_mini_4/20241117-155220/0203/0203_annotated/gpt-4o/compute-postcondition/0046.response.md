The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting solely of the characters 'D' and 'R'. After executing the function body, it processes the `votes` string and returns a value based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' in the string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `votes`, and return a result based on the counts of the characters 'D' and 'R' in the `votes` string.
