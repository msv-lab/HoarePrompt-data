Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from user input, calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks for duplicate remainders. If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits the program. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, the function does not perform any calculations and directly prints 'Yes'. **
