The code initializes `seen` as an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` retain their previous integer values, and `seen` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `seen` is an empty set**
