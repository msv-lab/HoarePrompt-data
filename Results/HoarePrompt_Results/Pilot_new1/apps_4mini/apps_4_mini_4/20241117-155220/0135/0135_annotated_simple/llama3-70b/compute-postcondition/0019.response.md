Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains 0 and 1, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is equal to `n % 3`. If `remainder` is either 0 or 1 (both of which are present in `seen`), the output is 'No'. If `remainder` is 2, the program does not print anything and continues execution.***
