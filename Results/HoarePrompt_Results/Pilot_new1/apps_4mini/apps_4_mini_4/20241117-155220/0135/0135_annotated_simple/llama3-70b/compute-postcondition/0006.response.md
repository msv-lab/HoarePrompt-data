The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program is exiting. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function prints 'No' before exiting.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function prints 'No' before exiting.**
