The code snippet `exit()` is executed, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program will stop running. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables before the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains 0 and 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is now equal to `n % 3, and the output is 'No'**
