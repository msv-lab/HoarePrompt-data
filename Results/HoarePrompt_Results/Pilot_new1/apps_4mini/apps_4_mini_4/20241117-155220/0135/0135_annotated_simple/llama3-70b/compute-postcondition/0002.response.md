According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 1 to `k`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `k` must be at least 1. The variable `n` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, and `seen` being an empty set does not impact the loop execution either.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and at the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
