The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input()` accepts a string of two integers separated by a space, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Since the initial state indicates that `n` and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 10^18, their specific values will depend on the input given. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now set to the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
