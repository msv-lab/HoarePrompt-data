The code initializes `seen` as an empty set. The variables `n` and `k` retain their values as input integers, and no changes are made to them by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the new variable `seen`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set**
