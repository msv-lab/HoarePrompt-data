The code `seen.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The variable `remainder` is defined as `n % 3`, and since the initial state indicates that `remainder` is already in `seen` when the program checks it, the `seen` set will now include `remainder` if it was not already present. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (an input integer), `k` (greater than or equal to 3), and `seen` (the set containing `remainder`). 

If `remainder` was already in `seen`, the output would have been 'No', but since the program continues without any output, we assume `remainder` was not already present in `seen`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `remainder` has been added to `seen`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`**
