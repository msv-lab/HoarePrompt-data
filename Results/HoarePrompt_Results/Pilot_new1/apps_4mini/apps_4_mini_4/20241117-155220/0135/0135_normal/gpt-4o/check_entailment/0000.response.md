To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to check if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from 1 to `k` are distinct. The conditions specify that if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`, the output should be "No". If all remainders are distinct, the output should be "Yes".

### Program Analysis:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'
print(func_1(n, k))
```

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If so, it returns "No". This is correct since for any `i` in the range from 1 to `k`, if `k >= n`, `n mod k` will equal `n` when `k` equals `n`, and thus duplicates will exist.
   - If `k < n`, it initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to track the remainders. It then iterates over the range from 1 to `k`, calculating `n mod i` for each `i`. If any remainder has already been seen, it returns "No". If all remainders are distinct, it returns "Yes".

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The case where `k = 1` is not explicitly handled. However, since the loop will execute for `i = 1`, `n mod 1` will always be `0`, and since there's no other `i` to compare with, it will return "Yes", which is correct for this specific case.
   - The function does not handle the case where `k < 1`, but given the constraints (1 ≤ `n`, `k`), this should not occur.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe the function's behavior accurately. They state:
- The function returns "No" if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- If `k` is less than `n`, it checks for duplicates in the remainders.
- The function does not handle the case where `k` is less than 1, but this is irrelevant given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all valid inputs within the specified constraints. There are no edge cases that cause the function to fail based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**.
