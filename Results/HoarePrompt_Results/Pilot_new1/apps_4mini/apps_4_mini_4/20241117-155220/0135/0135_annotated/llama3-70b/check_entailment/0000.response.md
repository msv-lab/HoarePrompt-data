To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to check whether all remainders of `n` divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that for all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`, the condition `n % i ≠ n % j` holds.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Set for Unique Remainders**: It initializes an empty set called `seen` to track the unique remainders.
3. **Loop through 1 to k**: The program iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder `n % i` for each `i`.
4. **Check for Duplicates**:
   - If the calculated `remainder` already exists in the `seen` set, it prints "No" and exits, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If the remainder is unique, it adds it to the `seen` set.
5. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints "Yes".

### Edge Cases:
- If `k = 1`, the only remainder is `n % 1`, which is always `0`. Thus, it will always print "Yes".
- If `k` is greater than `n`, the remainders will vary from `0` to `n` for `n % i` where `i` ranges from `1` to `n`. This is important because for `i > n`, the remainders will be `n` itself, which could lead to duplicates.
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `1`, but according to the problem constraints, `k` will always be at least `1`.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations state that:
- If any remainder is repeated during the loop execution, "No" is printed, and the program exits immediately.
- If `k` is at least `1`, the loop will execute, and the remainders will be the result of `n % i`, which can range from `0` to `i-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine if all remainders are distinct for the specified range. However, if `k` is larger than `n`, the remainders will start repeating once `i` exceeds `n`. 

#### Example Case:
Consider `n = 5` and `k = 6`:
- Remainders will be: 
  - `5 % 1 = 0`
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 3 = 2`
  - `5 % 4 = 1`
  - `5 % 5 = 0`
  - `5 % 6 = 5`
  
Here, both `5 % 2` and `5 % 4` yield `1`, and `5 % 1` and `5 % 5` yield `0`, which means the program should return "No". However, it would return "Yes" for `k = 6` because it only checks up to `k` and does not consider the potential overlap of remainders for values beyond `n`.

Thus, there exists a case where the program does not function as expected.

Correctness: **False**. The code fails to account for cases where `k > n`, leading to potential duplicate remainders that are not handled correctly.
