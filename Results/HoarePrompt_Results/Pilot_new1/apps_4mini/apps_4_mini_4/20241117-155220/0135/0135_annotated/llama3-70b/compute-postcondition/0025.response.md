Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` through user input, checks the unique remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and prints 'No' if any remainder is repeated. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any values. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and it directly prints 'Yes' since there are no remainders to check. **
