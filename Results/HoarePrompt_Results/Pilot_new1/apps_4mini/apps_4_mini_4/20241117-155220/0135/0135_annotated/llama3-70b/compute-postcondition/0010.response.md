The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. Since `i` is 2, `remainder` will be the result of `n` modulo 2. The specific value of `n` is not known, but `remainder` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `n` is even or odd. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
