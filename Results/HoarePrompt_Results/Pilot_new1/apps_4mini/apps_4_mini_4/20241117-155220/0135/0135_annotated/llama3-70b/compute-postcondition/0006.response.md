The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program exits. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the output is 'No', and the program exits.
