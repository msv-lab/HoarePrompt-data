According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `k` is a positive integer, it is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be adjusted to 2. The other states (`n`, `k`, `seen_remainders`, and `remainder`) do not need to be changed since they are not affected by the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is 0**
