Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a non-empty list, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0 initially. If `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If `(x - b)` is negative or not a multiple of `balance`, `count` remains 0.***
