Postcondition: ***`cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the program attempts to print `n + 1`, but an error occurs due to the undefined variable `n`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the program prints -1, which also occurs if `cnt0` equals `cnt1` since the denominator becomes zero. Otherwise, the program prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is derived from the calculation involving `x` and `balance`. This accounts for all edge cases regarding the relationship between `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `x`.***
