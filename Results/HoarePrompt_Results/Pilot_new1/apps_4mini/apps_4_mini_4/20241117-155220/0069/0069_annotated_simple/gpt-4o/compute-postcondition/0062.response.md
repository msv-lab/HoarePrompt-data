Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`. Otherwise, `0` is appended to `results`. This accounts for the scenario where `x` could be any valid value in relation to the elements of `prefix_balances`, including the case where `x` is not in the list, ensuring that the results reflect the presence or absence of `x` in `prefix_balances`.***
