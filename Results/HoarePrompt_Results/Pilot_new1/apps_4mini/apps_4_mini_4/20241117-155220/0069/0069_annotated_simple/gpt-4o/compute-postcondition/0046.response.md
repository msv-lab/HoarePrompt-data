The value of `index` is incremented by 3. However, the previous value of `index` is unknown, and the values of `prefix_balances`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.
