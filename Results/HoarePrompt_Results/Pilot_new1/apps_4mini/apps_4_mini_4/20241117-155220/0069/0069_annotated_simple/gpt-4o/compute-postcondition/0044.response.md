The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is converted to an integer and stored in `x`. The previous values of `prefix_balances` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, and `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, and `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]**
