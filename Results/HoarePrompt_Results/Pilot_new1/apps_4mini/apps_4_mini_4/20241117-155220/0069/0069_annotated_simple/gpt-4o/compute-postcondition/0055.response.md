According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased to 4. Additionally, since the loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`, we must ensure that `n` is at least 3 for `i` to be valid in the next iteration. 

However, since `prefix_balances` is initialized with a length of `n + 1`, and `i` is currently 3, it implies that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue. Therefore, no adjustments to `n` are necessary as long as it is at least 3.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`. 

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements as 0; `i` is 4; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2, 0, or -2; `prefix_balances[3]` is either 3, 1, -1, -3, or -1, depending on the value of `s[2]`.**
