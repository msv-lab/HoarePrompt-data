The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `T` is greater than `t`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.
