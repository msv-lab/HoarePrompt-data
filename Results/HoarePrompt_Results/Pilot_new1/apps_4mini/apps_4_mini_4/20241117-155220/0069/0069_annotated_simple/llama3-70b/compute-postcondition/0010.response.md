The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. It does not change the values of any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is not equal to `x`, and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and the function prints -1.**
