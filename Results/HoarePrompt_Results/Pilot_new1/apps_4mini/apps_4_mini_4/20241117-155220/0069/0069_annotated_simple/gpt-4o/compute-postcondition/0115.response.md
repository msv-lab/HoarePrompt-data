Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, and `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`; if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `0` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is calculated as the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this `count` is appended to `results`. This covers the case where `n` is at least 1, causing the loop to execute, and also handles the scenario where `n` is 0 or lower, leaving `prefix_balances` initialized with 0s.***
