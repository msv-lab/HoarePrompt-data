Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where each element represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, with `prefix_balances[0]` initialized to 0. The variable `balance` is not equal to 0, indicating that there is an imbalance in the counts of '0's and '1's in the substring. If `n` is at least 1, the list contains values that reflect this imbalance; if `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.***
