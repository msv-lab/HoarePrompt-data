Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the condition was satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied, `count` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, and the loop will start over with `b` being the first element in the list.***
