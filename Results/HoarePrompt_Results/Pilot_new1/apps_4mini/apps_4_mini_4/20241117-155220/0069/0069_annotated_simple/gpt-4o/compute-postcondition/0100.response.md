Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, where the final value of `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times and `prefix_balances` has been updated based on the characters in `s`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains initialized with 0s.***
