The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the result of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus either `1` or `-1`, depending on whether the character at `s[i - 1]` is `'0'` or not. The variable `i` is 1, so we are looking at the first index of `prefix_balances`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` (which is `prefix_balances[0]`) is `0` since the list is initialized with all elements as `0`. 

If `s[0]` is `'0'`, then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `0 + 1 = 1`. If `s[0]` is not `'0'`, then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`. Therefore, the output state can be expressed based on the value of `s[0]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements as 0; `i` is 1; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 (if `s[0]` is '0') or -1 (if `s[0]` is not '0')**
