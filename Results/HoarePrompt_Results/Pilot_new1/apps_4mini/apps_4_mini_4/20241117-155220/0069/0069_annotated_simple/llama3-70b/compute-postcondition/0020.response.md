The code attempts to print `n + 1`, but the variable `n` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, it cannot evaluate the expression `n + 1`. The values of `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and an error occurs due to undefined variable `n`.**
