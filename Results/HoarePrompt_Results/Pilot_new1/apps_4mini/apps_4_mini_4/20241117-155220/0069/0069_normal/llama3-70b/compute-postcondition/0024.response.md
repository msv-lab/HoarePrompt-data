Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints -1, indicating that the difference is exactly divisible by the count difference. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the adjusted quotient incremented by one, ensuring all cases are handled, including when `cnt0` equals `cnt1` to avoid division by zero.***
