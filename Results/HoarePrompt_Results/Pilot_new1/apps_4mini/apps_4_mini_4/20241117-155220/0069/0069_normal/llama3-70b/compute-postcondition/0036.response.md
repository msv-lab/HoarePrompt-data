Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the printed output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `balance` is not equal to `x`, the printed output is -1, indicating that the balance cannot be adjusted. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, the printed output is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the number of complete cycles needed to adjust the balance towards `x`. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial values.**
