The value of `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. Given that `index` is 1, this means `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, where `data[2]` is derived from the list or array `data`. The variables `n`, `T`, and `results` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `x` based on the value at `data[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value derived from `data[1]`, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `x` is the integer value of `data[2]**.
