Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each entry `prefix_balances[i]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` reflects the cumulative balance based on the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is either incremented or decremented by 1 depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is '0' or '1'. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times and `prefix_balances[n]` will reflect the final balance. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros.**
