Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where each character contributes either +1 (if '0') or -1 (if '1'). The value `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and the balance remains equal to 0, indicating that the contributions from `s[0]` to `s[i-1]` sum to zero.***
