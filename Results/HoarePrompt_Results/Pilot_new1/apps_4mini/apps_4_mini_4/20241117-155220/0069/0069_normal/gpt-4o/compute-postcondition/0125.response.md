Output State: **If T is greater than 0, results will contain at least T elements, and each element will be printed in order. If T is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and results remains an empty list. If n is 0 or negative, prefix_balances will be a list of length 1 initialized to zero, and the loop for calculating prefix balances will not execute, leaving it unchanged. Additionally, if index exceeds the length of data during the loop execution, it may lead to an index error, which is not handled in the current code.**
