Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, indicating a balanced cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, then if `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`; otherwise, 0 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of valid `b` values where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. This covers all cases, including when `n` is positive, zero, or negative, ensuring that the function handles the balance correctly for all specified conditions.***
