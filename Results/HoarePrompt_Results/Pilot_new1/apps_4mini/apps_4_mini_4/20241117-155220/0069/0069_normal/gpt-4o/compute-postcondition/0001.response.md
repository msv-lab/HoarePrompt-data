The `data` variable is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which means it takes the entire input read from standard input and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The previous state of `input` is not affected, but the value of `data` will now hold the split components of the input string. Therefore, the output state is: `input` contains the entire input read from standard input, and `data` is a list of substrings derived from that input.

Output State: **`input` contains the entire input read from standard input, and `data` is a list of substrings derived from that input**
