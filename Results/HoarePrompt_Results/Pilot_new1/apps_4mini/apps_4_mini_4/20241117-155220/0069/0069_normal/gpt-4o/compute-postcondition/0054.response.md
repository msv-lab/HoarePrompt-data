The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at `s[i - 1]`. The variable `i` is 3, so we are looking at `prefix_balances[3]`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[3]` will be updated by adding either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[2]` (the character at index 2) is '0' or '1'. 

Since `prefix_balances[3]` is either 1 or -1 before this operation, the output state will reflect this update. 

Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the character `s[2]`, resulting in `prefix_balances[3]` being either updated to 2 or 0.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the character `s[2]`, resulting in `prefix_balances[3]` being either updated to 2 or 0.**
