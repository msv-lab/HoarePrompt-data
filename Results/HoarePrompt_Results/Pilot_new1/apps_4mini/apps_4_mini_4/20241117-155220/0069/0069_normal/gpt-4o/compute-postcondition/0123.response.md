The code prints the value of `result`, which is the third element in the list `results`. Since `results` has at least 3 elements, `result` will have a valid value. The values of `T` and `results` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `results` has at least 3 elements, and the function prints the value of `result`, which is the third element in the list.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` has at least 3 elements, and the function prints the value of `result`, which is the third element in the list**
