According to the code, the loop will execute `T` times. Since `T` is defined as a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The loop does not depend on any other variables for execution, but it will iterate based on the value of `T`.

At the start of the loop, the loop variable (which is represented by `_` in this case) does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as it is a convention used when the variable is not needed. 

Therefore, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are already satisfied by the state provided. 

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100)**
