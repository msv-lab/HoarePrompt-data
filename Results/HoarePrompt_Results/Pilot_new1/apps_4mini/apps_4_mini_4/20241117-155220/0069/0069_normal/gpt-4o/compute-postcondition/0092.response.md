According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop runs while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, we must ensure that `n` is at least 4 for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be updated to 4.
- `n` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the value of `s[2]`**
