According to the code, the loop will execute `T` times, and each iteration is independent of the previous iterations. The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder, meaning it does not affect the state of the program outside of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, we do not have information about `T`, which represents the total number of iterations to be executed. Therefore, we need to ensure that `T` is greater than the current iteration count to allow for one more execution of the loop.

Since the loop will execute as long as there are remaining iterations (i.e., `T` is greater than the current count of completed iterations), we need to adjust the state such that `T` is at least one greater than the current iteration count.

Assuming the loop has executed `T-1` times, we need to set `T` to `T`, and we also need to reflect that the loop will be executing for the `T`th time.

State: **`T` is greater than the current iteration count, indicating that the loop can execute one more time**
