Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, then `results` will contain -1; if `x` is not found, `results` will contain 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` will represent the number of elements `b` in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` will be updated to include this `count`. Throughout the execution, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and if `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, leaving `prefix_balances` as a list of length 1 initialized to all zeros. Additionally, `T` remains greater than 0 as long as it is initially greater than the current iteration count.***
