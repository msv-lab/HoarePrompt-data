Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums based on the string `s`, `balance` is 0, and `n` is at least 1 (or 0 or lower). If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain -1; otherwise, `results` will have an appended value of 0. The list `prefix_balances` remains unchanged throughout the execution.***
