Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and if `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `(x - b)` is negative or not a multiple of `balance`, the value of `count` remains unchanged.***
