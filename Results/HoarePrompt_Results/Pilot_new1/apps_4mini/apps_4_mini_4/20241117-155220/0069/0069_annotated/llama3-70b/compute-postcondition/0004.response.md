The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the values of the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` depend on the content of `s`, but the previous values of `n` and `x` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`**
