The code appends `-1` to the list `results`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains cumulative balances, `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`. However, the operation of appending `-1` does not affect the values of `n`, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the addition to the `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now contains -1 appended to it.**
