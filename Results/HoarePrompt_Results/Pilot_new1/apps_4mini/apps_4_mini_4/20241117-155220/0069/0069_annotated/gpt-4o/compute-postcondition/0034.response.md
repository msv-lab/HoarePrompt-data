Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`, then if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being at least 2. If `(x - b) % balance != 0` or `(x - b) // balance < 0`, `count` remains 1.***
