Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, if `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special care is taken to avoid division by zero, as this case is handled by the conditions in the else part.***
