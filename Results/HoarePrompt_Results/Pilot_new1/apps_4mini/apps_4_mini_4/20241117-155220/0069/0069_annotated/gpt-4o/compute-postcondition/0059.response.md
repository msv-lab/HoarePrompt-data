The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous state of `results` contains `-1`, so after the execution, `results` will contain at least two `-1` values. The other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, `x`, `T`, and `index`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums of '0's and '1's up to index `n`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an integer assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` contains at least two `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, and `index` is increased by 3.
