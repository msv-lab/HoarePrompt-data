Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains at least 3 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is an integer derived from `data[index + 1]`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, and `index` is increased by 3. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. Additionally, `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances`.***
