Output State: **If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1, indicating that either `assigned` is empty or does not contain any value of `a[i] - x` that meets the condition for forming; `assigned` now includes `a[i]`. If `can_form` is True, then `m` remains unchanged and `assigned` now includes `a[i]`.**
