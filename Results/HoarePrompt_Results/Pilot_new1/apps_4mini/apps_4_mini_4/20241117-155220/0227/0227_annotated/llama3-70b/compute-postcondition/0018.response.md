Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list are not double the previous element, starting from 1. If the count exceeds 23, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count. If `n` is less than 1, it does not handle this case explicitly, as the input is expected to be valid based on the problem constraints. **
