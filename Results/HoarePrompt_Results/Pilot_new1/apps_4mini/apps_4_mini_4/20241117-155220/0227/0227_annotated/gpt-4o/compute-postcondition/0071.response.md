Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts and returns the number of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the differences of previously assigned elements in the list. If `n` is 1, it will return 1 since the only element cannot form any differences. If `n` is greater than 1, it iterates through the sorted list and updates the count based on the formation condition. **
