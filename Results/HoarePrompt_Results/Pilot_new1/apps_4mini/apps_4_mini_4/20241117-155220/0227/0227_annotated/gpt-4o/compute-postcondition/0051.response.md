The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a[n-1]`, and the difference between `a[1]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
