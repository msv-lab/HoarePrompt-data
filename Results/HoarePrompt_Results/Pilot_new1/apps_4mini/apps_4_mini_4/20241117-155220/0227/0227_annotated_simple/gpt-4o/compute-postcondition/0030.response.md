The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` contains at least one element, `i + 1` is a valid index for `a`, `m` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
