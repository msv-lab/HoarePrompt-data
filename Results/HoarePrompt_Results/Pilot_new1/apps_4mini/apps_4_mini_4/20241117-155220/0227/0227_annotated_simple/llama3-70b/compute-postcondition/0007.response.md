Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is 2 if the element at index `i` of `a` is not equal to double the element at index `i - 1` of `a`. In the case where `a[i]` equals `a[i - 1] * 2`, `m` remains 1. The index `i` is 1, and all elements in `a` are distinct and sorted.***
