The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will take input from the user, split the input string into separate elements, convert each element to an integer, and then create a list from those integers. The initial value of `a` is replaced by this new list of integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its value still represents the number of distinct positive integers that the user will input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range; `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers based on user input.**
