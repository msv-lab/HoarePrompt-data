The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is [a[0], a[1]], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a[1], and `can_form` is True.
