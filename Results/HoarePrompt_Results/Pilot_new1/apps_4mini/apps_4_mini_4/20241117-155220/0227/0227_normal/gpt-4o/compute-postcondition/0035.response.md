Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, with `n` remaining at least 2, `a` as a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` containing at least 3 elements, `m` being at least 2, `i` equal to 2, and `x` being the third element in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, while all other conditions hold.***
