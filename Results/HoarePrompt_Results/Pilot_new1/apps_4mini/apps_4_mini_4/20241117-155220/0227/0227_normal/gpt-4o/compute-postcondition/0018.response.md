Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is [a[0], a[1], a[2]], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is a[1]. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains unchanged and the program continues without breaking.***
