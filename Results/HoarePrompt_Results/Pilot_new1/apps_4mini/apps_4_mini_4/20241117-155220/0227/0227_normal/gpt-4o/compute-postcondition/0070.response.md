The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and the parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_k` satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, if `n` is equal to 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function returns the count of unique elements that cannot be formed by the differences of previously assigned elements in `assigned`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `a`, and return either 1 if `n` is 1 or the count of unique elements that cannot be formed by the differences of previously assigned elements for larger values of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `a`, returns 1 if `n` is 1, otherwise returns the count of unique elements that cannot be formed by the differences of previously assigned elements.**
