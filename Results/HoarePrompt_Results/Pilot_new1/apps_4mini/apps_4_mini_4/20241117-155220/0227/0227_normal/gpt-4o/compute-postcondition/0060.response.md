Postcondition: ***`can_form` remains True, `m` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least four elements, and `x` is the fourth element in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, the loop breaks, indicating that the condition is satisfied. If `a[i] - x` does not exist in `assigned`, the loop continues without changing the values of `can_form`, `m`, or `assigned`.***
