To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its annotations in light of the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to reconstruct the smallest integer `n` from a given string `s` (which is a shuffled version of the concatenated string of `n` and its digit count `k`) and a remembered substring `t`. The resulting integer `n` must not have leading zeros unless it is zero itself.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(s, t)` performs the following steps:
1. It creates a set of characters from the substring `t`.
2. It initializes an empty string `n`.
3. It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
   - If `c` is in the set created from `t`, it appends `c` to the string `n`.
4. After the loop, it appends the entire substring `t` to `n`.
5. Finally, it converts the concatenated string `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Annotations Summary:
- The annotations describe the state of `n` after the loop, indicating that `n` contains characters from `s` that are also in `t`, followed by `t` itself.
- It mentions that if `s` is empty or contains no characters found in `t`, the resulting string will consist solely of `t`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where `n` could start with leading zeros after the concatenation. For example, if `s` is "000012" and `t` is "01", the resulting string would be "00001201", which would convert to the integer `1201`. However, the smallest valid integer `n` should be `101` (the smallest integer that can be formed without leading zeros).
   
2. **Character Selection**: The program constructs `n` by picking characters from `s` that are present in `t`. This may not guarantee the smallest `n`. For instance, if `s` contains digits that can form a smaller integer when combined with `t`, those digits might be ignored if they are not in `t`.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
Input:
000012
01
```
The expected output should be `101`, but the program would output `1201` since it constructs `n` as "000012" + "01" which results in "00001201". When converted to an integer, it yields `1201`, which does not satisfy the requirement of being the smallest integer `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for leading zeros correctly and does not ensure that the smallest possible `n` is constructed. Therefore, it does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
