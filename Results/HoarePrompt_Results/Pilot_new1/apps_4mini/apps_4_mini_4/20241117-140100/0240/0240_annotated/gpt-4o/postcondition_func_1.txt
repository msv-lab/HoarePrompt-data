The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty string `sub`. It returns a boolean indicating whether `sub` is present in `num_str`. However, it does not check if the length of `num_str` is equal to any specified length, as the variable `n_len` is not defined within the function. Therefore, the function only checks for the presence of `sub` in `num_str` and does not enforce any length constraint on `num_str`.
