You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s_counter` has each character from `sub_counter` decremented by its count in `sub_counter`, `n_len` remains as `len(s) - len(sub)`, and `sub_counter` remains unchanged. If `sub_counter` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `s_counter` remains unchanged, while `n_len` is still `len(s) - len(sub)`.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'possible_numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string `s` containing digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters of `sub`. It then generates a list of possible numbers from the remaining characters and returns the minimum value from that list. If `sub` contains more characters than `s`, or if `s` does not contain the necessary characters to form `sub`, the function may not behave as expected, potentially leading to an error when trying to find the minimum value. Additionally, if `possible_numbers` is empty, calling `min()` will raise a `ValueError`.

#Function 2:
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the substring 'sub' is present in 'num_str' and if the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len'
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty string `sub`. It returns a boolean indicating whether `sub` is present in `num_str`. However, it does not check if the length of `num_str` is equal to any specified length, as the variable `n_len` is not defined within the function. Therefore, the function only checks for the presence of `sub` in `num_str` and does not enforce any length constraint on `num_str`.

#Function 3:
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. The loop will yield valid candidates that satisfy the `is_valid_number` condition with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and no candidates will be yielded. If `chars` has only one unique digit, the loop will execute only once, yielding a candidate if it meets the validity condition. If `sub` is longer than `chars`, the loop will not yield any candidates, as no valid number can be formed.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty substring of digits `sub`, and yields all valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the condition defined by the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is empty, no candidates will be yielded. If `sub` is longer than `chars`, no valid permutations can be formed, and thus no candidates will be yielded. The function does not insert `sub` into `chars`, but rather checks the validity of permutations of `chars` against `sub`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
