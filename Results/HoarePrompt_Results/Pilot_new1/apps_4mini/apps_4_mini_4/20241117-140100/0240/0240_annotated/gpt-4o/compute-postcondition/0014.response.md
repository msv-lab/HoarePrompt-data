Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. The loop will yield valid candidates that satisfy the `is_valid_number` condition with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and no candidates will be yielded. If `chars` has only one unique digit, the loop will execute only once, yielding a candidate if it meets the validity condition. If `sub` is longer than `chars`, the loop will not yield any candidates, as no valid number can be formed.**
