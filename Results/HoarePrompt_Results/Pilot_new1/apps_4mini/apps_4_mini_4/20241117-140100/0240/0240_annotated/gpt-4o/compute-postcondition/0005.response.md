According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the next permutation of `chars`. 

Since `perm` is currently set to the first permutation, the next permutation would be the second permutation of `chars`. Therefore, `perm` should be adjusted to reflect this.

There are no other states that need to be adjusted, as `chars` remains unchanged, and `candidate` is dependent on `perm`, which will be updated.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
