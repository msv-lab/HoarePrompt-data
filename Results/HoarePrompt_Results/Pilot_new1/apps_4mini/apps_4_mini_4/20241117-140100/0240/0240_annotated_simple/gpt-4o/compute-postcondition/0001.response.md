The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in the string `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be equal to `perm`. The state of `chars` remains unchanged, and `candidate` is now a string formed by joining the characters of `perm`. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
