The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`. It constructs a new string `n` by including only the characters from `s` that are also present in `t`. After the loop, it appends the entire string `t` to `n`. Finally, it returns the integer value of the resulting string `n`. If `s` is empty, `n` will simply be the integer value of `t`. If `t` contains leading zeros, those will be preserved in the string `n` before conversion to an integer.
