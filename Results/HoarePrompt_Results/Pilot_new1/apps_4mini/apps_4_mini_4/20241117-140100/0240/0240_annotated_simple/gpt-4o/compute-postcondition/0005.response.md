According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of `chars`. The current state indicates that `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. If the loop is to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`.

Since `perm` is currently the first permutation, the next permutation will be the second permutation of `chars`. The `candidate` will also need to be updated to reflect this new `perm`. 

The `chars` string remains unchanged, as it is still the same non-empty string of digits. The validity of `candidate` will depend on the new permutation, but since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to assess its validity right now.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
