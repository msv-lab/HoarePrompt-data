The function accepts a string `s` containing digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after subtracting the counts of characters found in `sub`. It then generates possible numbers from the remaining characters and returns the smallest number from that set. If `sub` contains characters not present in `s`, those characters do not affect the outcome, and if `s` is empty or contains no valid digits after the subtraction, the function may raise an error when trying to find the minimum value.
