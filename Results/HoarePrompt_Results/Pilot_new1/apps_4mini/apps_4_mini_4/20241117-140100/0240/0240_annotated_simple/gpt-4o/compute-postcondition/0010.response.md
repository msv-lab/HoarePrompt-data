`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of the `perm` iterable into a single string. Since `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, the value of `candidate` will be the string representation of that permutation. The state of `chars` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
