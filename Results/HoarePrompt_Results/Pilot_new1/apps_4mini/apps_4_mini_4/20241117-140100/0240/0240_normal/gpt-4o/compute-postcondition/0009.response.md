According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `chars` variable, which is used to generate permutations. The `permutations` function will generate all possible arrangements of the characters in `chars`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`. This means that there are still more permutations to be generated. The first permutation would have been yielded when `perm` was the first permutation, and now we are on the second. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence. Since `perm` is currently the second permutation, the next permutation will be the third permutation of `chars`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `perm` is now the third permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.**
