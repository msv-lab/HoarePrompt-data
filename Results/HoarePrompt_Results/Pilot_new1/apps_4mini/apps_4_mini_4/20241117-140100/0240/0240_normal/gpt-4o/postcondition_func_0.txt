The function accepts two non-empty strings of digits, `s` and `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters found in `sub`, and generates possible numbers from those remaining characters. It then returns the smallest number from the generated possibilities. If `sub` contains digits not present in `s`, those digits are effectively ignored, which may lead to cases where no valid number can be generated if all characters in `s` are removed by `sub`. In such cases, the function may raise an error if `possible_numbers` is empty when attempting to find the minimum.
