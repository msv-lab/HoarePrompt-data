According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence.

Since `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, it can have multiple permutations. The next permutation after the third one would be the fourth permutation of `chars`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `perm` is now the fourth permutation of `chars`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `chars` remains unchanged, and the conditions regarding `candidate` and `sub` are not relevant for the loop's continuation.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.**
