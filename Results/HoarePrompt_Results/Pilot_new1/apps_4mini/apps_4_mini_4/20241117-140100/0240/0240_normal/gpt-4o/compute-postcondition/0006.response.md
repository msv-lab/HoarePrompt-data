The variable `candidate` is assigned the value formed by joining the elements of `perm`. Since `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be the string representation of this permutation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**.
