The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. The parameter `chars` is a string of digits that represents a shuffled version of the integer `n` followed by its length `k`. The parameter `sub` is a non-empty string that represents a substring of `n`, which may contain leading zeroes. The function generates and returns all possible valid integers that can be formed from the characters in `chars`, ensuring that `sub` is a substring of each generated integer. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `chars` representing shuffled digits of an integer followed by its length, and a non-empty string `sub` representing a substring of that integer. It returns all possible valid integers formed from `chars` that include `sub` as a substring.**
