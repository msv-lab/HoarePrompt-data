Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits representing a shuffled version of the integer `n`, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`, then it is yielded. If `chars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `chars` contains digits but no valid permutations yield a valid candidate according to `is_valid_number`, then no candidates are yielded, and the state remains unchanged.**
