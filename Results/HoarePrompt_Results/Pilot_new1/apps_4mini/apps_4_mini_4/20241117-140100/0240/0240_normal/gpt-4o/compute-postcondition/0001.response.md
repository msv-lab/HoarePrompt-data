The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which joins the elements of the `perm` iterable into a single string. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be equal to `perm`. The state of `chars` remains unchanged, and the value of `candidate` is now a string formed by concatenating the elements of `perm`. 

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
