The value of `is_spalindrome` is explicitly set to `False`. This assignment does not depend on any previous values, but it confirms that `is_spalindrome` is now `False`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is set to False.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is set to False**
