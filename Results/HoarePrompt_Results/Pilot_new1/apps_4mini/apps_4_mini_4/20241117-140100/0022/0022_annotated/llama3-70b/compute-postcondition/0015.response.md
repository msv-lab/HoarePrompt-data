Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If `i` is such that it exceeds half of the length of `s`, the function assumes `s` is a palindrome unless a mismatch is found.***
