Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of at least 2 English letters, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters match, `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that the string may still be a palindrome, pending further checks.***
