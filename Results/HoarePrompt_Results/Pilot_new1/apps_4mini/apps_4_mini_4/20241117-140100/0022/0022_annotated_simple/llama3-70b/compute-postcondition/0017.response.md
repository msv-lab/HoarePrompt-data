Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if `s` is a palindrome, False if `s` is not a palindrome. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that a single character or an empty string is trivially a palindrome. If `n` is 2 or more, the loop executes up to `n // 2` times, comparing characters from both ends of the string. If any pair of characters do not match, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks.**
