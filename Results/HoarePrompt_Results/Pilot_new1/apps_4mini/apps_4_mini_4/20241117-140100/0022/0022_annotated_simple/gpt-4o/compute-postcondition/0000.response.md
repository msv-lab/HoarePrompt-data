The code assigns the value of `len(s)` to `n`. The length of the string `s` is between 1 and 1000, so `n` will be an integer value corresponding to that length. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s**
