Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and checks if it is a palindrome. It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, which includes the cases where `s` is an empty string or a single character, as both are considered palindromes. If `s` is not a palindrome, it returns `False`. The function does not handle cases where `s` is `None` or of a non-string type, which could lead to unexpected behavior. **
