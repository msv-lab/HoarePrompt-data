According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 5 because `n // 2` must be greater than `i` (which will be 2).

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 5 and `i` is 2.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 2**
