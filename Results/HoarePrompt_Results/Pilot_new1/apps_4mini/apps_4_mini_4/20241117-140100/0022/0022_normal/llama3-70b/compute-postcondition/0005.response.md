The value of `is_spalindrome` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string of English letters with a length of at least 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `is_spalindrome` is False; `i` is 0; the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`.
