Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the number of unknown voters (`z`) can influence the outcome in such a way that the result is uncertain.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1 1
```
In this case:
- Upvotes (`x`) = 1
- Downvotes (`y`) = 1
- Unknown votes (`z`) = 1

Here, the possible results can be:
- If the unknown voter upvotes, the result is `+` (1 upvote + 1 unknown upvote > 1 downvote).
- If the unknown voter downvotes, the result is `-` (1 upvote < 1 downvote + 1 unknown downvote).

Since there are two different possible outcomes (`+` and `-`), the result should be uncertain, and the program should print `?`. However, the program incorrectly classifies this scenario and would output `?`, which is correct, but does not handle the edge cases properly when `z` is involved.

Thus, the program is not handling all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect overall.
