The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, prints '-' if `x` is less than `y`, prints '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, prints '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, and prints '?' if `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`. It does not return any value.
