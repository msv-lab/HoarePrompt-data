To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic against the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
- The output should be:
  - "+" if upvotes are definitely greater than downvotes.
  - "-" if downvotes are definitely greater than upvotes.
  - "0" if upvotes are equal to downvotes.
  - "?" if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
min_upvotes = x
max_upvotes = x + z
min_downvotes = y
max_downvotes = y + z
if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
    print('-')
elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
    print('+')
else:
    print('?')
```

1. **Variables Calculation**:
   - `min_upvotes` is the minimum upvotes, which is just `x`.
   - `max_upvotes` is the maximum upvotes, which is `x + z`.
   - `min_downvotes` is the minimum downvotes, which is `y`.
   - `max_downvotes` is the maximum downvotes, which is `y + z`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, we conclude that downvotes are definitely greater.
   - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, we conclude that upvotes are definitely greater.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, the result is uncertain.

### Checking Edge Cases:
- Let's consider the case where `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`:
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, and `max_downvotes = 1`.
  - The program will evaluate `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` (1 < 0, False) and `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` (1 < 0, False), leading to an uncertain result. However, this case should output "?" as expected.

- Now consider the case where `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`:
  - `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 2`, `min_downvotes = 1`, and `max_downvotes = 2`.
  - The program will again evaluate both conditions and should output "?" since the result can be either "+" or "-".

- Another case to consider: `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`:
  - `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`.
  - The program should output "-" as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and scenarios outlined in the problem description. It covers all potential outcomes based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Correctness: **True**.
