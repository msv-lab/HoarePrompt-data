To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic.

The program takes three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input, representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes, respectively.

The logic of the program is as follows:

1. If \(x > y + z\), it prints '+'. This means there are more guaranteed upvotes than the total possible downvotes (including uncertain votes), which is correct.
2. If \(x < y\), it prints '-'. This means there are more guaranteed downvotes than upvotes, which is also correct.
3. If \(x == y\):
   - If \(z == 0\), it prints '0', indicating that the votes are equal and there are no uncertain votes, which is correct.
   - If \(z > 0\), it prints '?', indicating uncertainty because the uncertain votes could tip the balance either way, which is correct.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to printing '?', which is also correct since it indicates uncertainty.

Now, let's consider edge cases:

1. **Case when \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\), \(z = 1\)**:
   - The expected output is '?', since the one uncertain vote could either be an upvote or a downvote.
   - The program outputs '?', which is correct.

2. **Case when \(x = 3\), \(y = 7\), \(z = 0\)**:
   - The expected output is '-', since there are more downvotes than upvotes.
   - The program outputs '-', which is correct.

3. **Case when \(x = 2\), \(y = 0\), \(z = 1\)**:
   - The expected output is '+', since even with the uncertain vote, there are more upvotes.
   - The program outputs '+', which is correct.

4. **Case when \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), \(z = 0\)**:
   - The expected output is '0', since the votes are equal.
   - The program outputs '0', which is correct.

5. **Case when \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), \(z = 1\)**:
   - The expected output is '?', since the uncertain vote could tip the balance either way.
   - The program outputs '?', which is correct.

After analyzing all edge cases and the given examples, the program correctly handles all potential scenarios outlined in the problem description.

Thus, the final assessment is that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
