The function accepts no parameters and reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. It then prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met, indicating uncertainty about the outcome.
