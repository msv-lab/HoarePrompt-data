The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The initial state indicates that `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`. The value of `max_downvotes` depends on the current values of `y` and `z`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`**
