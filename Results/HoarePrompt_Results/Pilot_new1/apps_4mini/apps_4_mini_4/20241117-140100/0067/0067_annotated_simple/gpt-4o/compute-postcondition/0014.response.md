The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the assumption that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers that satisfy the constraints 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Since no specific output behavior is provided in the output description, we cannot determine the return values based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate with the integers `x`, `y`, and `z` within the specified range, but the exact return value is not defined.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on integers x, y, and z within the range of 0 to 100, but the exact return value is not specified.**
