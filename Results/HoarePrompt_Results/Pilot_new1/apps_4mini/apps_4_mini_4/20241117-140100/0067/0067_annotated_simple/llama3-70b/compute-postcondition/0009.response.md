The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '0'. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are not modified by this operation, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, `z` is equal to 0, and the printed output is '0'**.
