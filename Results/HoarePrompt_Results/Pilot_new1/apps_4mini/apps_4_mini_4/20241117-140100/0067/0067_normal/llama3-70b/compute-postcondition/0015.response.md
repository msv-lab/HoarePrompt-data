Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, '0' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is greater than 0, '?' is printed. If `x` is greater than `y`, then '?' is printed, while maintaining that `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x >= y` and `x <= y + z`).***
