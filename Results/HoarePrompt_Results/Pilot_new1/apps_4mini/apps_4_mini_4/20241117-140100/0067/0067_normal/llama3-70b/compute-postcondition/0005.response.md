The code executes a print statement that outputs a hyphen ('-'). The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects that the hyphen is printed, while the variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the hyphen '-' is printed.**
