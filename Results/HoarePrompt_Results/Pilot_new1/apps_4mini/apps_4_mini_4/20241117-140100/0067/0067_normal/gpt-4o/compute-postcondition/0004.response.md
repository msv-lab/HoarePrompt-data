The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The initial state indicates that `y` and `z` are integers based on the input values. Therefore, `max_downvotes` will be calculated as the sum of `y` and `z`. The values of `x`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on the input values; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
