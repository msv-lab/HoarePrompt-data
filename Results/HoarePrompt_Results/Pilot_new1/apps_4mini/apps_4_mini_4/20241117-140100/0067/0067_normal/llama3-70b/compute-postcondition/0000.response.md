The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from the input, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are unknown, as they are dependent on the input provided. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state indicates that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now integers based on the input values.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on the input values**
