Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. The maximum downvotes is greater than or equal to the minimum upvotes, which means `y + z` is greater than or equal to `x`. The minimum upvotes is equal to `x`, the maximum upvotes is equal to `x + z`, the minimum downvotes is equal to `y`, and the maximum downvotes is equal to `y + z`.***
