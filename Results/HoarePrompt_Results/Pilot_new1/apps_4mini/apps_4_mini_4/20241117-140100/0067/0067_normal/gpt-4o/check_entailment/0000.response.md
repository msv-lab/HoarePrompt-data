Let's analyze the provided program in relation to the problem description and the output hints.

**Problem description summary:**
- We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
- The output should be:
  - "+" if upvotes are definitively more than downvotes.
  - "-" if downvotes are definitively more than upvotes.
  - "0" if upvotes equal downvotes.
  - "?" if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
min_upvotes = x
max_upvotes = x + z
min_downvotes = y
max_downvotes = y + z
if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
    print('-')
elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
    print('+')
else:
    print('?')
```

1. **Logic Breakdown:**
   - `min_upvotes` is simply `x` (the known upvotes).
   - `max_upvotes` is `x + z` (the maximum possible upvotes considering all unknown votes could be upvotes).
   - `min_downvotes` is `y` (the known downvotes).
   - `max_downvotes` is `y + z` (the maximum possible downvotes considering all unknown votes could be downvotes).

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it means that even in the best-case scenario for upvotes (where all unknown votes are upvotes), they still cannot exceed the minimum downvotes. Therefore, the output should be "-".
   - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it means that even in the best-case scenario for downvotes, they cannot exceed the minimum upvotes. Therefore, the output should be "+".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it indicates that the results could overlap, leading to uncertainty, thus the output should be "?".

**Edge Cases:**
- When `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the output should be "?" since the unknown vote could either be an upvote or a downvote.
- When `x = 0`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`, the output should be "+" since the maximum upvotes (0 + 1) can exceed the minimum downvotes (1).
- When `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`, the output should be "0" since both upvotes and downvotes are equal.

**Output Hints Analysis:**
The output hints state that the function prints:
- '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes,
- '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes,
- '?' if neither condition is met.

This aligns with the program logic.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It accurately determines the result based on the given inputs, and the output hints are consistent with the code's behavior across all examined cases.

Correctness: **True**.
