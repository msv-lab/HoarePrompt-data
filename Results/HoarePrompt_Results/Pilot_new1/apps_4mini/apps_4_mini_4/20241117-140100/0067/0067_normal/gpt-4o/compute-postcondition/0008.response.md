Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. The maximum downvotes, which is `y + z`, is less than the minimum upvotes, which is `x`. Additionally, the maximum upvotes is equal to `x + z`, the minimum upvotes is equal to `x`, the minimum downvotes is equal to `y`, and the maximum downvotes is equal to `y + z`. Furthermore, it holds that `x + z` is greater than or equal to `y`.***
