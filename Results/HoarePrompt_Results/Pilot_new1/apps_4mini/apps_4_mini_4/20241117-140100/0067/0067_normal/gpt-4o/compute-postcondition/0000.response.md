The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from the input. The `map(int, input().split())` function reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns them to `x`, `y`, and `z`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are unknown since they depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now integers based on the input values.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on the input values**
