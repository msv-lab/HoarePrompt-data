Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` from user input and prints the nearest multiple of 10 based on the value of `n`. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints `n` rounded up to the next multiple of 10. The function does not return any values. **
