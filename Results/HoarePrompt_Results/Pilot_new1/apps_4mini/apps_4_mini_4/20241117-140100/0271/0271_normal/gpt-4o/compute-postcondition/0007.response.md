The provided code snippet prints the value of `result`, which is determined by the value of `remainder`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and \(10^9\), and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. 

If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`, which can yield values from `n + 1` to `n + 4`.

Since the code only prints `result`, we can summarize the output state based on the conditions for `remainder`:

1. If `0 ≤ remainder ≤ 5`, then `result = n - remainder`.
2. If `6 ≤ remainder ≤ 9`, then `result = n + (10 - remainder)`.

However, without specific values for `n` and `remainder`, we cannot determine an exact value for `result`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the conditions for `result` based on the possible values of `remainder`:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9; if `remainder` ≤ 5 then `result` = `n - remainder`; if `remainder` > 5 then `result` = `n + (10 - remainder)`**
