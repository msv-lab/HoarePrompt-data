The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is not changed directly by this line, but it is now set to the user-provided input value, which is a non-negative integer within the specified range. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
