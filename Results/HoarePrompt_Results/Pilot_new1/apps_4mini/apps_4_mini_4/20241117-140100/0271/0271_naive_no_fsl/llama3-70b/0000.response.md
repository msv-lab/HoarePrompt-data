Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where `n` is exactly halfway between two multiples of 10 correctly. Specifically, when `n` ends with 5, the program will round up to the next multiple of 10. According to the problem description, both rounding down to the previous multiple of 10 or rounding up to the next multiple of 10 are acceptable.

For example:
- If `n = 15`, the program will output `20`, but it should also consider `10` as a valid output since both `10` and `20` are correct answers.

Thus, the program fails to account for this scenario, making it incorrect.
