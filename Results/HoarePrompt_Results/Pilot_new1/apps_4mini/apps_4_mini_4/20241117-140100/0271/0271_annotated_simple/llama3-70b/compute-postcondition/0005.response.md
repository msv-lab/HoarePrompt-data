The expression `n - n % 10` calculates the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the output will be `n` rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10.

Since `n % 10` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, subtracting this remainder from `n` effectively removes the last digit of `n` in the decimal system, resulting in the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial value of `n` and the calculated value which is `n - n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the output is `n - n % 10`**
