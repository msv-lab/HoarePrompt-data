The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color` is assigned `colors[2]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
