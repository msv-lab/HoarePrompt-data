According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` has been incremented to the next position. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `right` must be equal to `n`, and no other states need to be adjusted since `current_counts` is already updated at the index of `colors[right]`.

State: **`current_counts` is updated at the index of `colors[n]`, `right` is n**
