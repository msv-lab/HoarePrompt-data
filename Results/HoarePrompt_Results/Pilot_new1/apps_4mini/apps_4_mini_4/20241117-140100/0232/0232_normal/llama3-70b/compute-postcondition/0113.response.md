Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the program continues without changing the values of `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.***
