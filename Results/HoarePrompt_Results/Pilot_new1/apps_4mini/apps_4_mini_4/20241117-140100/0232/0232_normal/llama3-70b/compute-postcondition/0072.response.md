Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop; otherwise, the program continues without modifying `found`.***
