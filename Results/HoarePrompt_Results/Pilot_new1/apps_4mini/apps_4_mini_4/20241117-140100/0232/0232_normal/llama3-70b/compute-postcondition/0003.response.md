The variable `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `colors`, or `counts`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
