Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, `found` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `window_counts[color]` is 1.***
