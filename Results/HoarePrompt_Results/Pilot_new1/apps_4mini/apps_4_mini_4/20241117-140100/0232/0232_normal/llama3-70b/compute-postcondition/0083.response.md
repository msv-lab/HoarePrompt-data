Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, indicating that the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. If the loop executed, `window_counts` contains the processed counts of colors from the specified range, and `i` is the starting index of that range. If the loop did not execute, `found` would remain False, `window_counts` would remain an empty dictionary, and `i` would be 0.***
