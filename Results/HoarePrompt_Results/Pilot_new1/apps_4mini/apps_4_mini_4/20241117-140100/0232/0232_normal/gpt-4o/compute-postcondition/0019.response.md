The value at `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The variable `right` has the value `n`, and `colors[n]` will provide the specific index for updating `current_counts`. The state of `current_counts` will change accordingly, but the exact previous values of `current_counts` and `colors[n]` are not specified.

Therefore, the output state is: `current_counts` is updated at the index of `colors[n]`, `right` is `n`.

Output State: **`current_counts` is updated at the index of `colors[n]`, `right` is `n`**
