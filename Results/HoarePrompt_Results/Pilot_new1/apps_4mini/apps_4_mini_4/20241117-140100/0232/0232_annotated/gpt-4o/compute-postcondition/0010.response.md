Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of elements is less than or equal to `n`, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to elements in `k`. If all current counts of colors match their respective desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. If at least one current count is less than its corresponding desired count, the function does not return 'YES'.***
