Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` has been updated with `window_counts[color]` incremented by 1, and all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
