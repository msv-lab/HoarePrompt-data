The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color` is the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `found` is set to True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
