Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is updated with `color` incremented by 1; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts`, the variable `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `found` or the loop execution.***
