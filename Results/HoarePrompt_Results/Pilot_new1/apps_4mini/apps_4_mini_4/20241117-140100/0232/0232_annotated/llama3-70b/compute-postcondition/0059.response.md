Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is an empty dictionary initially. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of `0`. The variable `found` remains False, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, no changes are made to the dictionary, and all other variables retain their initial values.***
