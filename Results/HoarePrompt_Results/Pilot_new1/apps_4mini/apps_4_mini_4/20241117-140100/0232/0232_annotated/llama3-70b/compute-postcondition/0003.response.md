The code initializes an empty dictionary `color_counts`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `colors`, or `counts`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the new state of `color_counts`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `colors` is a list of new integers based on input, `counts` is now a list of integers based on input, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary {}**
