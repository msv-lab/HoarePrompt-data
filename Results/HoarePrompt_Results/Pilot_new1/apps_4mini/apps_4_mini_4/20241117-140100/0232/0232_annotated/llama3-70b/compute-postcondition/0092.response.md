Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `color`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of `0`. The variable `found` remains True, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, with `color` assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, no changes are made to the dictionary, and the other variables retain their stated values.***
