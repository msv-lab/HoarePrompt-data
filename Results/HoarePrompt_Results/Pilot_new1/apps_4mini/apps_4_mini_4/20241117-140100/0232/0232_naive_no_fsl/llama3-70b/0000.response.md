Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if there exists a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights with the exact counts of lightsabers specified. 

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
2 1
```

According to the problem description, we need to find a contiguous subarray that contains exactly 2 lightsabers of color 1 and 1 lightsaber of color 2. The valid subarray in this case is `1 1 2`, which meets the requirement.

However, the program checks for the counts of colors only by comparing sorted values. In this case, the program will not find a match because it will check the counts of the entire array and not consider the specific contiguous intervals correctly. The logic used in the program does not ensure that the counts are checked for the specific range of colors needed, leading to incorrect results in cases where the required counts can be satisfied by a subarray but are not the full array.

Thus, due to this failing case, the program is incorrect.
