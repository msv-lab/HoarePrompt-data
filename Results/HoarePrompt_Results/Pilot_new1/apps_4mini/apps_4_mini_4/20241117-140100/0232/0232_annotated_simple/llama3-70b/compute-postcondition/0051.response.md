The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `window_counts` contains the matched values, and `color_counts` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
