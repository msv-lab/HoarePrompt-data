The values of `n` and `m` are assigned from the input, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The previous values of `colors` and `counts` are not affected, as they are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `m` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and `counts` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ sum(counts) ≤ n; `n` and `m` are updated based on input.**
