The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is updated with `color` incremented by 1; `color_counts` remains unchanged; `j` is equal to `i`; `n` is greater than `i`; and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop.
