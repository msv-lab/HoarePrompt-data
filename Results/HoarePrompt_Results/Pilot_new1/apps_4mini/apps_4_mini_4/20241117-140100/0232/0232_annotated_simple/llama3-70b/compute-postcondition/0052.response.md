Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that a successful match has been found with `window_counts` containing the matched values and `color_counts` remaining unchanged. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains empty, `color_counts` remains unchanged, and `i` is 0 when `n` is greater than 0, or the loop does not execute when `n` is less than or equal to 0, resulting in the same state.***
