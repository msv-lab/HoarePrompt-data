Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, indicating a successful match. In this case, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, but `window_counts[color]` has been increased by 1.***
