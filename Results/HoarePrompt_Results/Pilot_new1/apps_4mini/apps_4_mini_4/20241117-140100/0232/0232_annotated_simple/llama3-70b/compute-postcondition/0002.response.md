The variable `counts` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into parts. The input will provide a sequence of integers that will populate the `counts` list. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `colors` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `colors`, along with the new value of `counts` being a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers based on input, `counts` is a list of integers from input**
