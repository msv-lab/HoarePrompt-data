The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to `n-1`, `found` is True, and the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
