Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that now includes the key `color` set to 0 if `color` was not previously present. The `color_counts` remains unchanged, while `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
