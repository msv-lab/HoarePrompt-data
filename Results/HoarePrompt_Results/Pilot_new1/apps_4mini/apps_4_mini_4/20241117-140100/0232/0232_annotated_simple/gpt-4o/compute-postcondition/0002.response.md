Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to corresponding values from `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict of int initialized to 0 for any accessed key, and `left` is initialized to 0.**
