Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is updated with `color` incremented by 1, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `n` is greater than `i`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the loop continues without setting `found` to True.***
