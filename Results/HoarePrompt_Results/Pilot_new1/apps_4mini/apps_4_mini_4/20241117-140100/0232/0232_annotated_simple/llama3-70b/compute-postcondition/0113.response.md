Postcondition: ***`window_counts` includes the key `color`, which has been incremented by 1. If the counts of the sorted values in `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `color` remain unchanged throughout this process.***
