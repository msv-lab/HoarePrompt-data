Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, and `i` is 1. If `used_cubes[1]` is not previously used and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `used_cubes[1]` remains unchanged and `found` may not be set to True.***
