The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, where `i` is 2. This means that the third element (index 2) of the `used_cubes` list is marked as `True`. The previous values of `used_cubes` are not provided, but the assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that the third element of `used_cubes` has been updated.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[2]` is True**
