According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one digit, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `found` is a boolean value. If `found` is False, it means that the function has not yet found the `digit` in any of the `cube_faces` lists or all cubes were already used. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `digits` list must contain at least one more digit than it did at the end of the last iteration. If `n` (the length of `digits`) is less than 1, the loop cannot execute again, and `found` would remain False.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `digits` has at least one digit remaining to iterate over. Assuming `found` is still False and `used_cubes` remains unchanged, we can state that the `digits` list must have at least one digit.

State: **`found` is False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit**
