The variable `num` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that it should be an integer that could be derived from the context of `cube_faces`. The code converts `num` to a string and then creates a list of its digits.

Since `num` is not provided, we cannot determine its value or the resulting `digits` list. Therefore, we can only acknowledge that `digits` will be a list of characters representing the digits of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of integers; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`**
