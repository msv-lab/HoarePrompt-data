The code initializes a list called `used_cubes` with `n` boolean values, all set to `False`. The variable `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, meaning `used_cubes` will contain either 1, 2, or 3 elements, all initialized to `False`. The other variables, `cube_faces` and `digits`, remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `used_cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of integers; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values all set to False**
