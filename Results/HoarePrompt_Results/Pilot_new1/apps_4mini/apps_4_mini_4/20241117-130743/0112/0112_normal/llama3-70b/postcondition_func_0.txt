The function accepts an integer `n` (where `n` is expected to be between 1 and 3) and reads `n` lists of integers from input. It collects all unique digits from these lists, removes the digit '0' if present, and then constructs and prints the largest possible integer that can be formed by concatenating the remaining digits in descending order. If no digits are left after removing '0', the function will result in an empty output.
