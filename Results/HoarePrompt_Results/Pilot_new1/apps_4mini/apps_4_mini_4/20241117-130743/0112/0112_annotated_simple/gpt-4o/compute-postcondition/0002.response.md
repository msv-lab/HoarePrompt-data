According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. The loop will execute if `digits` contains at least one element. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, we know that `used_cubes` has `n` elements, but this does not affect the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, we need to ensure that `digits` is not empty.

For the loop to be executed, `digits` must contain at least one element. The initial state of `used_cubes` does not impact the loop execution. Thus, we can set `digits` to a list with at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element**
