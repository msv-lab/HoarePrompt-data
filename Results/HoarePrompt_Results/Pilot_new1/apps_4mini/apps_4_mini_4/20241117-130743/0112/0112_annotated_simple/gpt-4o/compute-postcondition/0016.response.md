The statement `used_cubes[i] = True` assigns the value `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. The previous value of `i` is 2, but we do not have the initial state of `used_cubes`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value at index 2 of `used_cubes` has been set to `True`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[2]` is set to True**
