According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop condition is that `i` must be less than `n` for it to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is 3. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time.

After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will need to be adjusted to 3 in the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is still 3.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the conditions regarding `used_cubes` and `digit` do not affect the loop's ability to execute again in this context.

State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 3**
