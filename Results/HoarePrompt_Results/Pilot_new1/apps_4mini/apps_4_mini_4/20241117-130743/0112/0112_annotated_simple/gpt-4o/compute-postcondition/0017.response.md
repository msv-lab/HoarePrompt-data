The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or `used_cubes[2]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new value of `found`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, and `found` is True**
