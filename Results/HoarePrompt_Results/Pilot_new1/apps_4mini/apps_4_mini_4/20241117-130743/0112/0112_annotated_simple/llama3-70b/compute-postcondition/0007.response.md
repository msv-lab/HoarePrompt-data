According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute again, the `cubes` list must contain at least 3 lists. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least 3 lists, and the `cube` variable must reference the third list in `cubes`. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to reflect that there are at least 3 lists in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that n is greater than or equal to 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 lists; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of elements in `cube`.**
