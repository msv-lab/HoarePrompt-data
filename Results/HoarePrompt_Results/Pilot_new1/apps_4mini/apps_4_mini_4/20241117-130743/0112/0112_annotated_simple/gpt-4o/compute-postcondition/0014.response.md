Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged, and `found` remains False.***
