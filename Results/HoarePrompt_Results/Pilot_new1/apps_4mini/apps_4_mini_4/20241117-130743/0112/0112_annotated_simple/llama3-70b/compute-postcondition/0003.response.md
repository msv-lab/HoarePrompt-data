According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list. Given that `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, it implies that the `cubes` list is expected to have at least `n` elements, which ensures that the loop can iterate through at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration, since the loop iterates over `cubes`, the variable `cube` would be set to the last element of the `cubes` list. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `cubes` is not empty and contains at least one list. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in the cubes**
