The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value or the resulting `digits` list. The code converts `num` to a string, and then creates a list of its characters. Since `num` is undefined, we cannot ascertain the resulting `digits`. Therefore, the output state indicates that `num` is not defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, but `num` is not defined.**
