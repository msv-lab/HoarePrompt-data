The code prints the value of `max_num`. The value of `max_num` is defined as the largest integer formed by sorting `digits` in descending order, but the specific value of `max_num` is not provided in the initial state. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `n` and indicates that `max_num` is printed.

Output State: **`max_num` is the largest integer formed by sorting `digits` in descending order, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and the value of `max_num` is printed.**
