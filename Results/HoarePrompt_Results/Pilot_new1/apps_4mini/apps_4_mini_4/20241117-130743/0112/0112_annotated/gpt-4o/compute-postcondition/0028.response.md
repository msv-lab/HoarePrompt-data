The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, which is its initial value. Since `found` remains `False` and no other variables are affected, the output state reflects the unchanged values. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `digits` has at least two more digits.

Output State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `digits` has at least two more digits**
