Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing string representations of integers found in the lists within `cubes`. If '0' was present in `digits`, it has been removed. The value of `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with a length between 0 and 3. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set.***
