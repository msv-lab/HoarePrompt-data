The code initializes `used_cubes` as a list of boolean values, all set to `False`, with a length equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` will contain `n` elements, all of which are `False`. The values of `cube_faces` and `digits` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `used_cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9); `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all set to False.**
