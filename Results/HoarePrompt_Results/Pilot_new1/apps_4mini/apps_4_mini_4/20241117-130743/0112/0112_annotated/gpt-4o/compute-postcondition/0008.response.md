The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with the first element set to True, `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
