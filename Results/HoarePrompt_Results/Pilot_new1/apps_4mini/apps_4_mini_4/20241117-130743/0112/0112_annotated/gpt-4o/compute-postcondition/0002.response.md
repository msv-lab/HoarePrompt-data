According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to False, we need to ensure that `digits` contains at least one element for the loop to run. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `digit` will take on the value of each element in the `digits` list, starting from the first element. Therefore, we need to ensure the following states:

1. `digits` must contain at least one digit.
2. `digit` must be initialized to the first element of the `digits` list.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `digits` contains at least one element and that `digit` is the first element in that list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to False, `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list**.
