According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to represent the next iteration.

Since `i` is currently at its last value (which is `n-1` if it was 0-indexed), for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n`, which is not less than `n` and will cause the loop to terminate.

No other states need to be adjusted since `cube_faces`, `digits`, and `used_cubes` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, initially all set to False, `i` is `n`**
