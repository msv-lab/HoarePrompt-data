Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values initially all set to False. If `i` is a valid index (0 ≤ i < n) and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True and `found` is set to True. If `i` is out of range, an error occurs due to the index being invalid, and `found` remains unchanged.***
