According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If `digits` has at least one more digit, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least two more digits. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to ensure that `digits` has at least three digits, and since the loop iterates over `digits`, the next `digit` should be the next digit in the list.

State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `digits` has at least 3 digits, `digit` is the next digit in the list**
