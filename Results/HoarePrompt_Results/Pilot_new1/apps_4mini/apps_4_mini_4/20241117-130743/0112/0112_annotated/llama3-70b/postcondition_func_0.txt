The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lists of integers from user input. It collects all unique digits from these integers into a set. If the digit '0' is present, it removes it from the set. The function then forms the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order and prints this integer. If no valid digits remain after removing '0', the function will attempt to create an integer from an empty set, which may lead to an error or unexpected output.
