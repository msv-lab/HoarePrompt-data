According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more lists in `cubes` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, which means there is at least one list in `cubes`. Since `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 2 lists, and `cube` should be the second list in the `cubes` list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`**
