According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, meaning it will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute again. 

Since `i` is currently at its maximum value of `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished its iterations. However, since `i` cannot be `n` and still be valid in the next iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop has completed its iterations.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `n` remains greater than 1.
2. `i` should be adjusted to `n`, meaning it cannot execute again.
3. `used_cubes` can remain as is since it is not directly affected by the loop's iteration count.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is n, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values initially all set to False**
