Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the given ratio of 1:2:4. It does this by determining the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be made, which is computed using `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This ensures that the number of apples and pears used is appropriate for the number of lemons, adhering to the recipe's requirements.

For example:
1. If there are 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears, the program calculates `min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4)` which gives `min(2, 2, 1) = 1`. Thus, it prints `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is correct.
2. If there are 4 lemons, 7 apples, and 13 pears, it calculates `min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4)` which gives `min(4, 3, 3) = 3`. It prints `3 + 6 + 12 = 21`, which is also correct.
3. If there are 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, it calculates `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4)` which gives `min(2, 1, 0) = 0`. It prints `0`, which is correct since no complete set can be formed.

Since the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
