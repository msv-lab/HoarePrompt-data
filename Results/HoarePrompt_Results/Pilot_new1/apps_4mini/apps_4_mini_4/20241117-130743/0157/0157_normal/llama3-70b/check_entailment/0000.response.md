The provided program is designed to determine the maximum number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to create a compote in the ratio of 1:2:4. The code calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be made based on the available quantities of each fruit.

Let's break down the code and assess its correctness:

1. **Understanding the Code**:
   - It reads three integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
   - It calculates `min_lemon`, which is the minimum of:
     - The number of lemons `a`.
     - Half the number of apples `b // 2` (since each set requires 2 apples).
     - A quarter of the number of pears `c // 4` (since each set requires 4 pears).
   - Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used in the compote, calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no lemons, apples, or pears available in sufficient quantities to form at least one complete set (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears), the program should return 0. 
   - The code correctly handles the case where `min_lemon` is 0, leading to a total output of 0.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints confirm that the function calculates the minimum number of complete sets of items and prints the total value of the sets created, which aligns with the logic in the code.
   - They also clarify that the function does not return a value but prints the result directly.

4. **Verification Against Examples**:
   - For the first example (2 lemons, 5 apples, 7 pears), the output is `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is correct.
   - For the second example (4 lemons, 7 apples, 13 pears), the output is `3 + 6 + 12 = 21`, which is also correct.
   - For the third example (2 lemons, 3 apples, 2 pears), the program correctly outputs 0 since there are not enough pears.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as the output hints, I find that the program correctly handles all described cases and adheres to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program successfully computes the maximum total number of fruits that can be used for the compote according to the specified ratios, and it correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description.
