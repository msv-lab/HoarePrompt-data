The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input three integers. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients needed to create a dish using the given quantities, where each set requires 1 unit of the first ingredient, 2 units of the second ingredient, and 4 units of the third ingredient. The function then prints the total quantity of ingredients used for the maximum number of complete sets, which is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. The function does not return any value.
