The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that are constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function returns a value based on these integers, but the specific output is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to work with the positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified range, but the exact return value is unspecified.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on three positive integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000), but the return value is not specified.**
