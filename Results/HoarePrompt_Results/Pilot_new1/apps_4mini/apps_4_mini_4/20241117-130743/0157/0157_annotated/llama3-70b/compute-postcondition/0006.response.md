Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of lemonades that can be made using `a` lemons, `b` sugar (with 2 units of sugar required per set), and `c` water (with 4 units of water required per set). It then computes and prints the total number of ingredients needed for the sets made, which is `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, where `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The function does not return any value. **
