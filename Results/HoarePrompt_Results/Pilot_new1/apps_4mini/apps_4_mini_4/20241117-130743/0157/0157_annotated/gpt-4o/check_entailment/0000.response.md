To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). He needs to use these fruits in the ratio of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears) to make a compote. The objective is to find the maximum total number of fruits he can use based on the available quantities.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers from input, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: The code calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used by taking the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`)
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. **Calculating Total Fruits**: The total number of fruits used is calculated based on the maximum number of lemons that can be used, multiplied by their respective ratios (1 for lemons, 2 for apples, and 4 for pears).
4. **Output**: The total number of fruits is printed.

### Annotations Analysis:
- The annotations describe the function's behavior and how it calculates the number of fruits used based on the available ingredients. They correctly summarize the logic of the code.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1**:
  - Input: `2`, `5`, `7`
  - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
  - Total: `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (Correct)
  
- **Case 2**:
  - Input: `4`, `7`, `13`
  - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
  - Total: `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` (Correct)

- **Case 3**:
  - Input: `2`, `3`, `2`
  - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
  - Total: `0` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Input Values**: If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the result should be `0` because there are not enough fruits to satisfy the ratio.
2. **Excess Fruits**: If `a = 10`, `b = 20`, `c = 40`, the result should be `10 + 20 + 40 = 70`, which is correctly handled by the code.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and requirements set out in the problem description without missing any edge cases or potential issues. 

Therefore, the final judgment is:

Correctness: **True** 

The code accurately calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the given ratios and available quantities.
