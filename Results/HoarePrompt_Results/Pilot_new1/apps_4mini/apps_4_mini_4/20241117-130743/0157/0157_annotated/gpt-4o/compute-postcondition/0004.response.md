The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the value `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which determines the maximum number of lemons that can be produced based on the input integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, or `max_lemons * 7`. The states of the other variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7**
