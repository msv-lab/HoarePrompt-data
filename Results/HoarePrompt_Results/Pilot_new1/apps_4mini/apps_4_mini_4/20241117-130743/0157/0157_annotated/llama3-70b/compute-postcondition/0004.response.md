To calculate the output state, we first need to determine the value of `min_lemon`. 

`min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. After calculating `min_lemon`, we then substitute it into the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`.

The expression simplifies as follows:
- The total expression can be rewritten as:
  - `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7`

Thus, the output state will depend on the value of `min_lemon`.

The output state will reflect the values of the input integers and the calculated `min_lemon`, along with the final result of the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an updated integer from input, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4; the printed result is min_lemon * 7**
