The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and their specific values will determine the outcome of the minimum calculation. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an updated integer from input, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an updated integer from input, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**
