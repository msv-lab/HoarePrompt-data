Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: The program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote using the formula:
   ```python
   max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
   ```
   This line ensures that:
   - The number of lemons does not exceed the available lemons (`a`).
   - The number of apples used (which is twice the number of lemons) does not exceed the available apples (`b`).
   - The number of pears used (which is four times the number of lemons) does not exceed the available pears (`c`).

3. **Calculating Total Fruits**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as:
   ```python
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
   This correctly sums the number of lemons, apples, and pears based on the maximum number of lemons that can be used.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits.

The program correctly handles edge cases as well:
- If there are not enough pears, apples, or lemons to make any compote, `max_lemons` will be 0, resulting in a total of 0 fruits, which is the expected output.

All provided test cases in the problem description yield the expected results, confirming that the program works correctly for the defined problem. Thus, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.
