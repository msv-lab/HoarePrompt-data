Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; if `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is updated to 9, and if `k` is at least 2, further calculations are performed to update `dp[n, k]` based on the specified formula, while ensuring that `dp[n, k]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` remains 9. In all cases, the conditions on `l`, `r`, `k`, and `n` are respected.***
