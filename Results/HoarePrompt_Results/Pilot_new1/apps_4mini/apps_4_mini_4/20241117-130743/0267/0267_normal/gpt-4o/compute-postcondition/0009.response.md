The variable `total_sum` is updated with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is defined as `l + 2`. The value of `MOD` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a constant. 

Calculating the new value:
- Since `total_sum` is 0, the expression simplifies to:
  
  \[
  total\_sum = (0 + num) \% MOD = num \% MOD
  \]

The exact value of `total_sum` will depend on the value of `num` and `MOD`. However, we know that `num` is at least 3 (since `l` is at least 1). 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `total_sum` based on the provided conditions.

Output State: **`total_sum` is `num % MOD`, where `num` is `l + 2`, and `l` is such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18**
