The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The previous value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`, which is an integer within the range defined (1 <= l <= r < 10^18). Thus, the calculation becomes `(0 + l) % MOD`. Since `MOD` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact effect, but we can note that the result will be `l % MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true.**
