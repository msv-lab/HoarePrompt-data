Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. Otherwise, `dp[n, k]` is calculated based on the specified formula, and the value is taken modulo `MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution.***
