To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Given two integers `l` and `r` (with `l â‰¤ r`), and an integer `k`, we need to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
2. The result should be printed modulo `998244353`.

### Code Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function checks if a number `n` contains at most `k` different digits.
   - It converts the number to a string, creates a set of its characters (digits), and checks the length of this set against `k`.
   - This function appears to be correct as it accurately determines the number of unique digits in `n`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function iterates over each number from `l` to `r` (inclusive).
   - It calls `func_1` to check if the number has at most `k` different digits.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it adds the number to `total_sum`, applying the modulo operation to prevent overflow.
   - Finally, it returns `total_sum`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Efficiency**: The code uses a loop that iterates from `l` to `r`. Given that `l` and `r` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), this could lead to significant performance issues. The program may not terminate in a reasonable time for large ranges.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The problem does not specify how to handle cases where `l` and `r` are very close to each other (e.g., `l = r`). However, the logic appears to handle such cases correctly.
- **Modulo Constant**: The constant `MOD` is not defined in the provided code. Assuming it is meant to be `998244353`, this could lead to errors if not properly defined.

### Example Case:
Let's consider a case where `l = 1`, `r = 100`, and `k = 2`. The expected output would be the sum of numbers with at most 2 different digits, which includes numbers like 11, 22, 33, etc. However, the loop could take a very long time to execute due to the vast range.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for efficiency with the potential input size and may fail to execute in a reasonable timeframe for large values of `l` and `r`. Additionally, the undefined `MOD` constant could lead to runtime errors. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
