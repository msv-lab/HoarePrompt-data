To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of the code against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that contain at most `k` different digits, and return this sum modulo `998244353`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - Calls the `count` function for `r` and `l - 1` to get the number of valid numbers in the range and returns their difference modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - If `k` is 0, it returns 0. This is correct because no number can have 0 different digits.
   - It checks if the result for `(n, k)` is already computed (memoization).
   - If `n < 10 ** k`, it sets `dp[n, k] = n`, which means all numbers from 0 to `n` can be counted since they all can be formed with at most `k` digits.
   - If `n >= 10 ** k`, it calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits using a specific formula involving powers of 10 and iterates through the range.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Sum Calculation**: The `count` function does not actually calculate the sum of the numbers that meet the criteria; it only counts how many such numbers exist. The problem requires the sum of those numbers, not just the count.
2. **Missing Logic**: The program lacks logic to actually sum the numbers that have at most `k` different digits. It only tracks how many numbers fit that criterion but does not return their sum.

### Example Case:
Consider `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 1`. The valid numbers should be `11, 22, 33, 44`, which sum to `110`. However, the provided code will not calculate this sum at all, as it only counts valid numbers but does not compute their actual sum.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fulfill the requirement of calculating the sum of numbers containing at most `k` different digits. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
