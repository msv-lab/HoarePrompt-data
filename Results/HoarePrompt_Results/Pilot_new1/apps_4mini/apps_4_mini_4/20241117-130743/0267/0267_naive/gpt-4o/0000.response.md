Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the cases where `k` is less than the number of different digits in the numbers between `l` and `r`. Specifically, the `func_1` function checks if the number of different digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`, but the way the main function `func_2` iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r` is inefficient and could lead to performance issues, especially since `l` and `r` can be as large as \(10^{18}\).

For example, if we have `l = 1`, `r = 100`, and `k = 1`, the program will incorrectly include numbers like `2`, `3`, etc., which contain different digits, and thus should not be counted. The program does not efficiently filter or skip numbers that exceed the limit of `k` different digits, leading to incorrect results.

Additionally, the program does not account for large ranges efficiently, as it iterates through every number, which is not feasible for large values of `l` and `r`. 

Thus, there are clear cases where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
