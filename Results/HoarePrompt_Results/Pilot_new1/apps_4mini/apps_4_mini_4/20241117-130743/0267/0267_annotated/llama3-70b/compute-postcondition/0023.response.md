Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10), and a data structure `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0. If `k` is greater than 0 and the pair (n, k) exists in `dp`, it returns the value associated with (n, k) in `dp`. If (n, k) does not exist in `dp`, it calculates a value based on the relationship between `n` and powers of 10, updates `dp[n, k]` accordingly, and then returns this value. The function does not handle cases where `n` is negative or where `k` is outside the specified range.**
