To analyze the impact of the code snippet provided, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `l` is unchanged.
   - `r` is adjusted to `r + 1`, so we denote the new value of `r` as `r' = r + 1`.
   - `k` is unchanged.
   - `total_sum` is initialized to `0`.
   - `num` is assigned the value of `r + 1`, which is `num = r'`.

2. **Calculating `total_sum`**:
   - The code updates `total_sum` with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.
   - Since `total_sum` starts at `0`, we can simplify this to `total_sum = (0 + num) % MOD`, which is equivalent to `total_sum = num % MOD`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - `total_sum` is now equal to `num % MOD`.
   - `num` is `r'`, which is `r + 1`.
   - The values of `l`, `k`, and `r` are unchanged, but `total_sum` is now determined by the value of `num`.

With these calculations, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is adjusted to `r + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is `num % MOD`, `num` is `r + 1`**
