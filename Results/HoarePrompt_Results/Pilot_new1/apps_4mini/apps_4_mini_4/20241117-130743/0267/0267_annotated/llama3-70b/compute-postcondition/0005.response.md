Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is greater than 0 and the pair (n, k) exists in the data structure `dp`, the function returns the value associated with (n, k). If (n, k) does not exist in `dp`, the function does not return a value but continues execution.***
