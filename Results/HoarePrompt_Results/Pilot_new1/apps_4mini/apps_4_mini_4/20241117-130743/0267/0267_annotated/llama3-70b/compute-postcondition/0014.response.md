According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value (which is 1 since the loop starts from 1), and `k` has not been specified, so we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `k` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 * 10 * 10`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2**
