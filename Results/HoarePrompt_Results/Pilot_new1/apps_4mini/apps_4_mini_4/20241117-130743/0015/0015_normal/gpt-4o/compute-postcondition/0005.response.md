The code prints 'NO', which does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain intact. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned values from input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is equal to 0, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned values from input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is equal to 0, and 'NO' is printed.**
