The code prints 'NO', which does not change the values of the variables but indicates a specific output based on the conditions provided. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned values from input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; `c` is not equal to 0; `b` is not equal to `a`; and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is negative, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned values from input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; `c` is not equal to 0; `b` is not equal to `a`; and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is negative, and the output is 'NO'**
