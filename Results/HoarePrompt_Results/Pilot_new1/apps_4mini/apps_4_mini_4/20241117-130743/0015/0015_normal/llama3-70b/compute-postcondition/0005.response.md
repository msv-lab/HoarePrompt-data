The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify their values. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is equal to 0, `a` is not equal to `b`, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is equal to 0, `a` is not equal to `b`, and the output is 'NO'**.
