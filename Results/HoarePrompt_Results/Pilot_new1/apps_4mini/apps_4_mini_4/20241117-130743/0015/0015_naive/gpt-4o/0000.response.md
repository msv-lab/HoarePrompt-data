To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code:

1. The program reads three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. It checks if `b` is equal to `a`, in which case it outputs "YES".
3. If `c` is 0, it outputs "NO" unless `b` is equal to `a`, which is already handled.
4. If `c` is not zero, it checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`. If both conditions are true, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

Now, let's assess the correctness of the logic:

- The first condition (`b == a`) correctly identifies the case where `b` is the first element of the sequence.
- The second condition (`c == 0`) correctly handles the scenario where the sequence does not change (constant value). The output should be "YES" if `b` equals `a` and "NO" otherwise, which is correctly implemented.
- The third condition checks if the difference `(b - a)` is a multiple of `c` and that the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. This ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` repeatedly.

However, there is a potential issue with the handling of negative values for `c`. The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` might not correctly account for cases where `c` is negative. Specifically, if `c` is negative, the sequence will be decreasing, and we need to ensure that `b` is less than or equal to `a` for it to appear in the sequence. The current implementation does not properly handle this case.

For example, consider the input:
```
a = 10
b = 5
c = -2
```
In this case, `b` should appear in the sequence (10, 8, 6, 4, ...), but the program would incorrectly output "NO" because `(b - a) / c` would be negative.

Thus, the program fails for this input case.

Correctness: **False**.
