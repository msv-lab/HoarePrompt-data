Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle the case when `c` is negative. Specifically, when `c < 0`, the sequence will be decreasing. In this case, the condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` will not hold true for values of `b` that are less than `a`, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3 -1
```
In this case, the sequence would be `5, 4, 3, 2, ...`, which does contain the value `3`. However, the program would evaluate `(b - a) / c` as `(3 - 5) / -1 = 2`, which is non-negative. The program would incorrectly return "NO" because it only checks for non-negativity when `c < 0`, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
