To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to check whether a favorite integer `b` appears in a sequence defined by:
- First element `s_1 = a`
- Difference between neighboring elements `c`

The sequence can be expressed as:
- `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c` for `i >= 1`

We need to determine if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

### Code Analysis
The code is structured as follows:

1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - If `a == b`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `a != b`, it prints 'NO'.

   This logic is correct because if `c` is 0, the sequence does not change and only contains the value `a`. Therefore, `b` can only be in the sequence if `b` equals `a`.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - It checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

   - The first condition `(b - a) % c == 0` ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by steps of size `c`.
   - The second condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that we are moving in the correct direction (i.e., `b` is reachable by taking positive steps if `c` is positive, or negative steps if `c` is negative).

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some specific edge cases based on the problem description:

1. **Case where `c = 0`:**
   - Input: `10 10 0` → Output: 'YES' (correct)
   - Input: `10 5 0` → Output: 'NO' (correct)

2. **Case where `c > 0`:**
   - Input: `1 7 3` → Output: 'YES' (correct, sequence is `1, 4, 7`)
   - Input: `1 8 3` → Output: 'NO' (correct, sequence is `1, 4, 7, 10,...`)

3. **Case where `c < 0`:**
   - Input: `10 5 -2` → Output: 'YES' (correct, sequence is `10, 8, 6, 4, 2,...`)
   - Input: `10 6 -2` → Output: 'NO' (correct, sequence is `10, 8, 6, 4,...`)

### Conclusion
The code covers all cases as described in the problem. The annotations provided confirm that the logic checks for both the divisibility and the direction of the steps based on the value of `c`. 

Since I could not find any instance where the code fails to meet the problem description for any potential case, I conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
