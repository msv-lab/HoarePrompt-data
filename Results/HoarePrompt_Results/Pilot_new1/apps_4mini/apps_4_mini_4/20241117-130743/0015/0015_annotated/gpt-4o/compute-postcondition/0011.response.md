Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and (b - a) / c is non-negative, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO', which occurs if either the difference is not divisible by `c` or the result of (b - a) / c is negative.***
