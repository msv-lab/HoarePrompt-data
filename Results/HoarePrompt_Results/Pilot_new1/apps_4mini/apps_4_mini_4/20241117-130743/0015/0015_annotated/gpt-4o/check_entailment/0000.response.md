To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations in detail.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to determine if a number `b` appears in a sequence defined by:
- The first element is `a` (i.e., \( s_1 = a \))
- The difference between any two neighboring elements is `c` (i.e., \( s_i - s_{i-1} = c \))

The sequence can be expressed as:
- \( s_1 = a \)
- \( s_2 = a + c \)
- \( s_3 = a + 2c \)
- ...
- \( s_i = a + (i-1)c \)

We need to check if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \).

### Code Analysis
The function checks the following conditions:
1. If `b == a`, it prints 'YES'.
2. If `c == 0`, it prints 'NO' (since the sequence would be constant and equal to `a`).
3. If `c` is not zero, it checks:
   - If the difference \( (b - a) \) is divisible by `c`.
   - If \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative.

If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

### Edge Cases and Examples
1. **Case when `c = 0`:** 
   - If `a == b`, the output is 'YES'.
   - If `a != b`, the output is 'NO'. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Case when `c > 0`:**
   - The condition \( (b - a) \% c == 0 \) ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` repeatedly.
   - The condition \( (b - a) / c >= 0 \) ensures that we are moving forward in the sequence (i.e., we are not trying to go backwards).
   - This correctly captures all possible scenarios where `b` could appear in the sequence.

3. **Case when `c < 0`:**
   - The same checks apply, and they ensure that `b` can be reached from `a` while moving backwards in the sequence (i.e., subtracting `|c|`).

### Annotations Review
The annotations provide a summary of the logic:
- They confirm that if `b` is equal to `a`, the output is 'YES'.
- If `c` is zero, it correctly outputs 'NO' unless `b` is equal to `a`.
- For non-zero `c`, it checks the divisibility and non-negativity of the difference.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and the annotations, I find that the program handles all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. The logic for handling zero and non-zero values of `c` is sound, and the conditions for divisibility and non-negativity are appropriate.

Therefore, the program is correct for all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**.
