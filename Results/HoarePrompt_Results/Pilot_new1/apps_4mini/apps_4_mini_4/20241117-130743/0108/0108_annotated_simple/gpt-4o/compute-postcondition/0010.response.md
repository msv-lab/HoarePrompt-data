Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; and `j` is either 0 or 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being either 1 or 2. If there is no match, `j` remains unchanged.***
