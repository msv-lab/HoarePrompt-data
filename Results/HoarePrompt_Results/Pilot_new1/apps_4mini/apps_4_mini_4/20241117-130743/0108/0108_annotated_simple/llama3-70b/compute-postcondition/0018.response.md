The code appends the character `char`, which is 'b', to the existing string `res`. The previous state of `res` is not explicitly defined, but it is the concatenation of all characters found in `s` in alphabetical order until the first character not found in `s`. Therefore, the value of `res` will now include 'b' at the end.

Output State: **`res` is the concatenation of all characters found in `s` in the order of the alphabet until the first character not found in `s`, and `char` 'b' is added to `res.**
