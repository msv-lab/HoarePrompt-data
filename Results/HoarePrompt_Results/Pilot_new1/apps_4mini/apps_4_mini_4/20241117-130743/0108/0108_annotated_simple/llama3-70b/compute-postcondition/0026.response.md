The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. The initial state shows that `res` is the concatenation of characters 'a', 'b', 'c', which means `res` is currently 'abc'. The next character in the alphabet is 'd', so the value of `char` is 'd'. Therefore, after the execution, `res` becomes 'abcd'. The state of the variable `s` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` contains characters from 'a' to 'd', `res` is 'abcd'**
