Output State: **`if s contains characters from 'a' to 'z', then res is the concatenation of all characters found in s in the order of the alphabet until the first character not found in s; if s does not contain 'a' then the loop does not execute and res remains empty; if s contains characters beyond 'z', those will not affect the loop since it only checks for characters from 'a' to 'z' and will stop when the first character not found in s is reached.`**
