The value of `char` is 'a', and `res` is currently the concatenation of all characters found in `s` in alphabetical order until the first character not found in `s`. The code appends `char` ('a') to `res`. Since `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', 'a' is already included in `res`. Therefore, `res` will now include 'a' again, but since 'a' is already part of the string, the output state reflects that 'a' is added to `res`.

Output State: **`res` is the concatenation of all characters found in `s` in the order of the alphabet until the first character not found in `s`, and `char` 'a' is added to `res**.
