Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2. If the character at index 2 of `s` matches the character at index `j` of the string `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If the character does not match, `j` remains unchanged and retains its original value, which can be either 0 or 1.***
