The length of the string `target` is calculated using the `len()` function. The value of `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which has a length of 26. Therefore, `target_len` is assigned the value 26. The other variable `s` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26**
