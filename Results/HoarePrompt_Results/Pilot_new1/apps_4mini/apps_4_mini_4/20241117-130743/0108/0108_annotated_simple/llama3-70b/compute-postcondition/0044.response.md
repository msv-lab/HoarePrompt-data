Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a result string `res` by appending characters from `s` in alphabetical order, replacing each character with the next in the alphabet as it is found. If `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints `res`. If not all letters are present, or if `s` does not contain any letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints -1. The function does not handle uppercase letters or characters outside the lowercase English alphabet. **
