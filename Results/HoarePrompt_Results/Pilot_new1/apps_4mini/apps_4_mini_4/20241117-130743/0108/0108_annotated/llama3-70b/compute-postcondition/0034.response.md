According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has been updated by appending `char`, and `s` has been updated by replacing `char` with the next ASCII character. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `char` must still be present in the updated string `s`. Since `char` was replaced with the next ASCII character in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the new value of `char` (after the ASCII increment) is still in `s`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `char` has been updated to the next ASCII character and is still present in `s`.

State: **`res` is updated by appending `char`; `s` is updated by replacing `char` with the next ASCII character and `char` is present in s**
