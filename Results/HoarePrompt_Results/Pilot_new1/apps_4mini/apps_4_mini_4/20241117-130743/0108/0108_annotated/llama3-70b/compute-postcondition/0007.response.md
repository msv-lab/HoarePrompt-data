The variable `res` is modified by appending `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is 'a', and `char` is also 'a'. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will be 'aa'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is modified to contain 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
