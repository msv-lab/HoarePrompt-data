The value of `res` is incremented by the value of `char`. Since `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, `char` is a valid character. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it is being updated by appending `char` to it. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `res` but does not specify its previous value.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`; `res` is updated by appending `char`**
