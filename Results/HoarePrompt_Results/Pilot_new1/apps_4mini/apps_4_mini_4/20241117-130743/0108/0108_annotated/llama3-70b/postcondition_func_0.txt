The function accepts no parameters and processes user input from the console. It constructs a string `res` containing occurrences of each lowercase letter from 'a' to the highest letter found in the input string `s`. If `s` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints `res`. If `s` does not contain all lowercase letters, it prints -1. Additionally, characters in `s` that are less than or equal to 'z' are replaced with the next character in the alphabet, while characters greater than 'z' remain unaffected. If `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, `res` remains an empty string and -1 is printed. The function does not handle uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters.
