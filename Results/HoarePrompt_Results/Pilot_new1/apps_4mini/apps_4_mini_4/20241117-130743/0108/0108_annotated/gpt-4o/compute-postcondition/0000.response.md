The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input consisting of lowercase English letters. The length of `s` can range from 1 to 100,000 characters. The previous value of `s` is not specified, as it will be replaced by the new input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` will now hold the new input string.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000**
