The variables `i` and `j` are both assigned the value of 0. The other variables (`s`, `target`, and `target_len`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `i` and `j` while maintaining the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
