The value of `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input consisting of lowercase English letters. The length of `s` will be between 1 and 100,000 characters. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `s` is now the input string.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000**
