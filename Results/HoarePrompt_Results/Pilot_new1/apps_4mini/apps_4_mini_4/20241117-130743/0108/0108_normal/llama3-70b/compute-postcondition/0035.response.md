Output State: **`if char is in s then res` contains 'char' repeated for each occurrence of 'char' in the original 's', and 's' has all occurrences of 'char' replaced with the characters following it in the ASCII table until 'char' is no longer in 's'. If 'char' is not in 's', the loop doesn't execute and 'res' remains unchanged, while 's' remains the same.**
