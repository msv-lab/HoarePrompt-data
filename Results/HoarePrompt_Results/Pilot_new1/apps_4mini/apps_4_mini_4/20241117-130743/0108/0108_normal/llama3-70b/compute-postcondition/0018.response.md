The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char`, which is 'b'. Since `res` was previously updated by appending 'b', it will now have an additional 'b' appended to it. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and `char` is still 'b'. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res`.

Output State: **`s` contains 'a' and 'b'; `char` is 'b'; `res` is updated by appending 'b'**
