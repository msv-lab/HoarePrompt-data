Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; `j` is either 0, 1, or 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If the character does not match, `j` remains unchanged. In the case where `j` is already 2 and a match occurs, `j` would then be incremented to 3, indicating that all characters of `target` up to index 2 have been matched. Thus, `j` can only take values from 0 to 3 after execution.***
