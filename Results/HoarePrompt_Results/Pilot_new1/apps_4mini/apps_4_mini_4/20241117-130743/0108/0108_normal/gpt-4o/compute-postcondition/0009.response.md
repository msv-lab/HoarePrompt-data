The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` can either be 0 or 1, after the execution, `j` will be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is either 1 or 2.
