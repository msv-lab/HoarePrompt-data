The variable `s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that is one position ahead in the ASCII table of `char`. The initial state indicates that `res` has already been updated to include `char`, but the value of `s` and `char` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the modification made to `s` without changing the value of `res`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, and `s` is modified to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the character following it in the ASCII table**.
