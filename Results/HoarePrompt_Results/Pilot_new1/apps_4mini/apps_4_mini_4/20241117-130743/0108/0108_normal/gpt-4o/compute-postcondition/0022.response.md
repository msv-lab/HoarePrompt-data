Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `i` is the length of `s`, and `j` represents the number of matched characters from 'a' to 'z'. If `j` equals `target_len` (which is 26), the function prints `target`. If `s` is empty or does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', then `j` is 0 and the function prints -1. If `j` is less than 26 but greater than 0, the function prints -1, indicating that not all characters from 'a' to 'z' are present in `s`.***
