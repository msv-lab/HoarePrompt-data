The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` can be either 0, 1, or 2, the new possible values for `j` will be 1, 2, or 3, respectively. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; `j` is either 1, 2, or 3.
