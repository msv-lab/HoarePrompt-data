The code initializes two variables, `i` and `j`, both assigned the value 0. The values of `s`, `target`, and `target_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
