Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with two lists `s` and `b`. It calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it computes how many shares can be bought with `r`, calculates any remaining money after buying shares, and computes the total money obtained from selling the shares at the maximum sell price, plus the remaining money. Finally, it prints the total bourles. The function does not return any value but directly prints the result. **
