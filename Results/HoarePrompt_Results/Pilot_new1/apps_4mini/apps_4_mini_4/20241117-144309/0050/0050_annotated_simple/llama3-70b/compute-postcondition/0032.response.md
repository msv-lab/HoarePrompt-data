According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. However, since `shares` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, the loop will not execute the body again, and the execution will break out of the loop.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. The condition for `shares` remaining 0 does not need to be adjusted because it is still valid, as it allows the loop to break out if `shares` is not greater than 0.

State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `s` is a non-empty sorted list, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.**
