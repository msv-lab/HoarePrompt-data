The code assigns a new list to `s`, which is created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate strings. The previous values of `s` are replaced by the new list of integers. The variables `n`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged, but `s` will now hold a list of integers based on the new input. 

Output State: **`n` is input integer, `m` is input integer, `r` is input integer, `s` is a list of n integers based on new input, `b` is a list of m integers**
