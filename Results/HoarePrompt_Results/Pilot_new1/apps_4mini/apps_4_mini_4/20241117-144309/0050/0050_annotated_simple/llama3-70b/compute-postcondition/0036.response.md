Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `s` is a non-empty sorted list, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving the values of `r`, `shares`, and other variables unchanged.***
