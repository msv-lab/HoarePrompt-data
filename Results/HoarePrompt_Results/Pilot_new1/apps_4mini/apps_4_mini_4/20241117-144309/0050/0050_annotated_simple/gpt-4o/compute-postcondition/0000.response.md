The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from the input, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown since they are being set by the input. The lists `s` and `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `r` are now set to input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of n integers; `b` is a list of m integers**
