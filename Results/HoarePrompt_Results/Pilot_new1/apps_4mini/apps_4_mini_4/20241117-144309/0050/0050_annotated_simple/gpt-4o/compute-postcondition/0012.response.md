Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are integers; `s` is a list of `n` integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` when divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, which is then printed. This accounts for scenarios where no shares can be bought (if `r` is less than `min_buy_price`), as well as when `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`, ensuring all edge cases regarding share buying and selling are covered.***
