The variable `b` is assigned a new value, which is a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the input values split from a string. The previous state of `b` is not defined since it was not specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `n` integers based on new input, and `b` is a list of integers based on new input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `n` integers based on new input, and `b` is a list of integers based on new input**
