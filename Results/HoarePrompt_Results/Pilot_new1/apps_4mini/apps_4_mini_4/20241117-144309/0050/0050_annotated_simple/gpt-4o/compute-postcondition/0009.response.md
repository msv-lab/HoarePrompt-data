The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`, where `r` is an input integer and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`. The values of `r` and `min_buy_price` are not specified, but `remaining_bourles` will hold the remainder of the division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, `max_shares` is `r // min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`.**
