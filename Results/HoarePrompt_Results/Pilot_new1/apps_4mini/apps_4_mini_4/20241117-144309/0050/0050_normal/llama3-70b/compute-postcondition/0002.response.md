The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects that `b` is now a list of integers from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned input integers; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input**
