The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It calculates the total shares that can be bought with the initial amount `r` based on the buying prices in list `s`. Then, it attempts to increase the amount `r` by selling these shares at the prices in list `b`. Finally, it prints the resulting amount `r`. If `n` or `m` is 0, or if `r` is less than the smallest buying price in `s`, the function may not perform any calculations and simply print the initial value of `r`. The function does not return any value but prints the final amount.
