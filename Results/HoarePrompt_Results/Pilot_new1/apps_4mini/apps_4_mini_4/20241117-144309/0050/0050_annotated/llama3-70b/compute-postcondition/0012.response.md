Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer assigned from input, `r` is an integer assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in reverse order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, then `shares` is increased by `r // s[0]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[0]`. If `r` is less than `s[0]`, the loop breaks, leaving `shares` unchanged at 0, `i` at 0, and `r` as it was before the execution of the if statement. Additionally, if `r` is less than any subsequent `s[i]` during the execution, the loop will break before any further updates to `shares` or `r` occur.***
