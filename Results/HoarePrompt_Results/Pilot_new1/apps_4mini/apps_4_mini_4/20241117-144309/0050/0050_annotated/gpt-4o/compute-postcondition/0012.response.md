Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, then prints `total_bourles`. This covers cases where both prices are equal, and where the selling price is greater than the buying price, ensuring all potential scenarios are addressed.***
