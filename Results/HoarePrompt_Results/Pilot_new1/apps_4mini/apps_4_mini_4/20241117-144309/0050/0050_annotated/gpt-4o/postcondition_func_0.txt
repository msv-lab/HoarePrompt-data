The function accepts input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with two lists `s` and `b` representing buying and selling prices, respectively. It calculates the minimum buying price and the maximum selling price. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it outputs the value of `r`. Otherwise, it computes the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining money after purchasing shares, and the total amount of money that can be obtained by selling the shares at the maximum selling price, which it then outputs. The function does not return any values but prints the results directly.
