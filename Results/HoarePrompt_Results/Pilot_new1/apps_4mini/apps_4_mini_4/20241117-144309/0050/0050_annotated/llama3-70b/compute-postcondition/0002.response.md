The variable `b` is assigned a new value which is a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into components. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged, but `b` will now contain integers derived from the input. The output state reflects the new assignment of `b` while maintaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned integer values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of m integers derived from input.**
