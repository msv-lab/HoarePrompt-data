The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is equal to 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `s` is a non-empty list with no zero elements, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
