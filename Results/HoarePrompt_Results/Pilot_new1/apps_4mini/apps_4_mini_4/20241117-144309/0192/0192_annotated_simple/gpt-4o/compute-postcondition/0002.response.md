The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on two integers, `x` and `y`, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function will return an output based on the values of `x` and `y`, although the specific output is not provided in the prompt. Since there are no details on the return value, we cannot specify the output behavior.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on integers x and y, constrained by 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific return value based on these integers is not detailed.**
