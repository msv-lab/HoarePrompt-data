The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided, which will be two integers. Since `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are now specific integers based on the input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `x` and `y` are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers based on the input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
