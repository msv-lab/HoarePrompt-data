To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet given the initial conditions.

1. The expression `(x - y)` is calculated first. Since `y` is guaranteed to be less than `x`, this will yield a positive integer.
2. The floor division `//` by 2 is applied to `(x - y)`, which gives the integer part of half the difference.
3. The modulus `%` operation is applied to `(x - y)` to determine if the difference is odd or even. This will yield either 0 (if even) or 1 (if odd).
4. The results of the two calculations are added together.

Since `x` and `y` are integers where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, we can conclude that the output will always be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `x` and `y`, and the result of the print statement, which is the computed value based on the given formula.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2**
