Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from input, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, and calculates and prints the result of the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. This effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y` and prints it. The function does not return any value. **
