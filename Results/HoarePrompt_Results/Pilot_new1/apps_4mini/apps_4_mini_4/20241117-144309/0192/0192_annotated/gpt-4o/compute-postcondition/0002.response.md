The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details on the function's behavior or output, we cannot determine the exact functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The output is unspecified.**
