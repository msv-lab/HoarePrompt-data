The value of `a` is assigned the result of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means any leading zeroes in the string representation of `a` will be removed. If `a` originally contained only zeroes, it will become an empty string. The value of `b` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` after removing leading zeroes, while `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer string**
