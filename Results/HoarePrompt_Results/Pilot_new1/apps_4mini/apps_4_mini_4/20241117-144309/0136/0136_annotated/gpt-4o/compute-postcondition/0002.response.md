The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed by the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state indicates that `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from input. The value of `data[1]` is not specified, but `lstrip('0')` will remove any leading zeros from that string. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the first element of `data` without leading zeros, `b` is the string from `data[1]` without leading zeros.

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `data` without leading zeros, `b` is the string from `data[1]` without leading zeros**
