The value of `a` is assigned the string `'0'`, which replaces its previous value. The initial state indicates that `a` is the first element of `data` without leading zeros, but now it is explicitly set to `'0'`. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is `'0'`, `b` is the string from `data[1]` without leading zeros.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the string from `data[1]` without leading zeros**
