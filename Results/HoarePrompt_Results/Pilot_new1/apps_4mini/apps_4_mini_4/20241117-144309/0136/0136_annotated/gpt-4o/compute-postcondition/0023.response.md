Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings without leading zeros, where `a` is the first element of `data` and `b` is the second element. If `a` is empty, it is treated as '0', and if `b` is empty, it is also treated as '0'. The lengths of `a` and `b` are equal. The output will be '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. All conditions regarding the values of `a` and `b` are maintained, ensuring that both variables are valid non-empty strings when compared.***
