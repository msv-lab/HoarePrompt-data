To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its annotations carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The program should read two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, which can contain leading zeroes.
2. It should determine if `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to `b`, and print the appropriate symbol: `<`, `>`, or `=`.
3. The input size can be very large (up to 10^6 digits).

### Code Analysis:
The provided function performs the following steps:
1. Reads input and splits it into two strings `a` and `b`.
2. Removes leading zeros from both strings.
3. If either string becomes empty after removing leading zeros, it sets that string to '0'.
4. Compares the lengths of the strings:
   - If the length of `a` is less than that of `b`, it prints `<`.
   - If the length of `a` is greater than that of `b`, it prints `>`.
   - If they are of equal length, it further compares the strings lexicographically to determine if `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to `b`.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations provide a detailed explanation of the code's behavior, particularly how it handles leading zeros and empty strings. They confirm that:
- Empty strings are treated as '0'.
- Comparisons are made based on the lengths of the strings and their lexicographical order when lengths are equal.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The code correctly handles leading zeros by stripping them and treating empty strings as '0'.
2. **Equal Lengths**: The code compares strings lexicographically when their lengths are equal, which is appropriate for string representation of integers.
3. **Comparison Logic**: The logic for comparison is sound and adheres to the requirements of the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
Upon reviewing the code and annotations, it appears that the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The annotations align with the code's behavior and confirm its correctness in handling the specified cases.

### Conclusion:
I could not find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly handles all specified scenarios, including those involving leading zeros and large integers.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it accurately reads two long integers, removes leading zeros, and compares them according to the specified rules, producing the correct output for all cases described in the problem statement.
