The value of `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that any leading zeroes from the input string will be removed. Since `b` is a non-negative integer string, it may become empty if the input consists only of zeroes. The variable `a` remains unchanged as the code only affects `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `b` after removing leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes**
