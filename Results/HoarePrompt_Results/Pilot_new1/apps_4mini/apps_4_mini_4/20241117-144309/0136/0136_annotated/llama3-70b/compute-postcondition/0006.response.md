The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string '<'. The initial state indicates that `a` is a non-negative integer string without leading zeroes, `b` is an input string without leading zeroes, and that `a` is less than `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are not changed by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer string without leading zeroes, `b` is an input string without leading zeroes, `a` is less than `b`, and the output is '<'.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer string without leading zeroes, `b` is an input string without leading zeroes, `a` is less than `b`, and the output is '<'**
