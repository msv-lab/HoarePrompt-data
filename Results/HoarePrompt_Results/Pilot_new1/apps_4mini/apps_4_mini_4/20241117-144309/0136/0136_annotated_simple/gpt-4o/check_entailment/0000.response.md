To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code step by step in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to compare two very large integers `a` and `b`, which may have leading zeroes.
2. The output should be:
   - `<` if `a < b`
   - `>` if `a > b`
   - `=` if `a == b`
3. The input can contain up to 10^6 digits.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
```

### Step-by-Step Logic:
1. The input is read as a whole line and split into two parts, `a` and `b`.
2. The leading zeroes are stripped from both `a` and `b`.
3. If `a` is empty after stripping, it is set to `'0'`. The same logic applies to `b`.
4. The program then compares the lengths of `a` and `b`:
   - If `len(a) < len(b)`, it prints `<`.
   - If `len(a) > len(b)`, it prints `>`.
   - If the lengths are equal, it performs a lexicographical comparison of `a` and `b`:
     - It prints `<` if `a < b`, `>` if `a > b`, and `=` if they are equal.

### Edge Cases:
- Input with leading zeroes: The program correctly handles this by stripping leading zeroes.
- Both numbers being zero: The program correctly sets them to `'0'` and outputs `=`.
- Very large numbers: The program uses string comparison, which is valid in Python for numbers represented as strings.

### Potential Issue:
The annotations state that "if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='." However, the logic does not account for the case where `a` is less than `b` after the length checks. This condition is handled correctly in the code.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. All edge cases, including leading zeroes and very large numbers, are handled appropriately. 

Therefore, I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
