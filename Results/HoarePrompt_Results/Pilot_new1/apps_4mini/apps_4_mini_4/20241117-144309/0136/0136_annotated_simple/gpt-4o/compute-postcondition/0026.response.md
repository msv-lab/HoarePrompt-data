The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and each string has a length of at most \(10^6\) characters. The function processes these strings and returns a result based on their values. However, the exact output or behavior of the function based on these inputs is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b` and return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers represented as strings, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
