You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".

    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes. If `a` is empty, it is set to '0'. In all cases, `b` remains as `data[1]` without leading zeroes.
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, or '0' if it was empty. If `b` is empty, it is set to '0'. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged as `data[1]` without leading zeroes.

                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are strings representing numbers without leading zeroes, or '0' if they are empty; the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. There are no cases where `a` is less than `b` due to the precondition that `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are strings representing numbers without leading zeroes, or '0' if they are empty, and their lengths are equal. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All comparisons are valid due to the precondition that ensures `a` and `b` are properly formatted strings of equal length.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, or '0' if it was empty; `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, then if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All comparisons are valid due to the precondition that ensures `a` and `b` are properly formatted strings.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, or '0' if it was empty; `b` is either an unchanged string representing a number without leading zeroes or '0' if it was empty. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output is determined by comparing the values of `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All comparisons are valid due to the precondition that ensures both strings are properly formatted.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
