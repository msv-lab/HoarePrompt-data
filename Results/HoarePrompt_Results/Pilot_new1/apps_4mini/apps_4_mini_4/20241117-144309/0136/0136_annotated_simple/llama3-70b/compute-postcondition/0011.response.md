The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes, and each string can contain no more than 10^6 digits. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the operation defined within the function body. However, the exact output or behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, which may contain leading zeroes and can be up to 10^6 digits long.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, potentially containing leading zeroes, with each string containing no more than 10^6 digits.**
