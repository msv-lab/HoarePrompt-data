The code prints the string '<'. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and their previous states are still valid. The output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, the strings `a` and `b` are not equal, and the string `a` is lexicographically less than the string `b`, and the output is '<'**
