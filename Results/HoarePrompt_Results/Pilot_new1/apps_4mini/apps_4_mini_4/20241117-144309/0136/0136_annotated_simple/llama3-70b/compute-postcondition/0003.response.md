The code prints the string '='. The values of the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and since `a` is equal to `b`, the output state reflects that. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, and `a` is equal to `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, and `a` is equal to `b**
