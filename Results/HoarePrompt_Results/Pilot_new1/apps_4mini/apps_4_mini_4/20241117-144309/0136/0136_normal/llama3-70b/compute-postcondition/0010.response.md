Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeroes removed, and `b` is an input string with leading zeroes removed. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'.***
