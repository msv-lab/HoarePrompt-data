The variable `a` is assigned the string value `'0'`. The initial state indicates that `a` was an empty string, but now it is updated to `'0'`. The variable `b` and the list `data` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is `'0'`, `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from input.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, `data` is a list of strings obtained from input**
