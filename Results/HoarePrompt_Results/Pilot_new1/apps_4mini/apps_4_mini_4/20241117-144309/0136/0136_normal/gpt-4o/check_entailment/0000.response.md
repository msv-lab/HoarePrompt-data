To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the output hints closely.

### Problem Description:
The task is to compare two very long integers `a` and `b`, which may contain leading zeros. The program should print:
- `<` if `a < b`
- `>` if `a > b`
- `=` if they are equal.

### Code Analysis:
```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read

def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if not a:
        a = '0'
    if not b:
        b = '0'
    if len(a) < len(b):
        print('<')
    elif len(a) > len(b):
        print('>')
    elif a < b:
        print('<')
    elif a > b:
        print('>')
    else:
        print('=')

func_1()
```

1. **Leading Zeros Handling**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both numbers, which is appropriate. If the resulting string is empty (meaning the number was all zeros), it assigns '0' to `a` or `b`.

2. **Length Comparison**: The program first compares the lengths of the stripped strings. This is a correct approach since, for non-negative integers, the number with more digits is greater.

3. **Lexicographical Comparison**: If the lengths are equal, the program compares the stripped strings lexicographically. This is valid for non-negative integers.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function:
- Accepts two non-negative integers as strings.
- Strips leading zeros and compares them.
- Prints the appropriate comparison symbol.

This aligns with the code functionality, confirming that the implementation matches the expected behavior described.

### Edge Case Consideration:
The code seems to handle various edge cases correctly:
- It correctly treats inputs like '00012345' and '12345' as equal.
- It handles cases where one or both numbers are zero, such as '0' and '0000'.
- It compares numbers with leading zeros effectively.

### Potential Issues:
However, there is one potential issue in the logic:
- The input reading method (`sys.stdin.read()`) may not be suitable for all environments, particularly if the input is not provided in a single read. This could lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.

### Conclusion:
Despite the potential issue with input reading, the core logic for comparing the two numbers is sound and adheres to the problem description. There are no logical flaws in the comparison process itself.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly handles all specified cases in the problem description, including leading zeros and comparisons of large integers.
