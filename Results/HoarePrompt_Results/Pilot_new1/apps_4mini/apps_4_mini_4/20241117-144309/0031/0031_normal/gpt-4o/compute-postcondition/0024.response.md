To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`
- `p_total` is the value of `denominator`
- `p_shared` is calculated as `(denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD`
- `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`
- `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`

The code snippet calls a function `func_1(A, B)` and assigns its return value to `g`. However, since we don't know the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `g` after the function call.

The variables `A` and `B` are affected by the assignments from `p_shared` and `p_total`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since we cannot determine the output of `func_1`, we can only state that `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B)`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the result of func_1(A, B)**.
