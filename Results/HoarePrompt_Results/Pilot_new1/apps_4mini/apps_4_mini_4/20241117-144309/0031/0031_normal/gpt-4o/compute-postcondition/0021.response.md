To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, which depends on the value of `k`.
   - `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The expression `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD` calculates the value of `p_shared`.
   - Here, `p_total` is the value of `denominator`, and `p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator` (dependent on `k`).
   - `MOD` is a constant that is added to ensure the result is non-negative before taking the modulus.

3. **Impact**: 
   - The calculation of `p_shared` does not change the values of `p_no_shared` or `p_total`, but it assigns a new value to `p_shared` based on the arithmetic operation involving these variables.

4. **Output State**: 
   - Since we do not have specific values for `numerator`, `denominator`, or `MOD`, we cannot provide numeric results, but we can describe the relationships.

Therefore, the output state reflects the relationships and calculations without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD**
