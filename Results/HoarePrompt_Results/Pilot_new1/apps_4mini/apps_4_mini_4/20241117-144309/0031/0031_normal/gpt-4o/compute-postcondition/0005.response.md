The value of `total_days` is assigned the value `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2` raised to the power of `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). Therefore, `total_days` will be \(2^n\). The state of `k` is not affected by this operation, and the output state will reflect the calculated value of `total_days`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.**
