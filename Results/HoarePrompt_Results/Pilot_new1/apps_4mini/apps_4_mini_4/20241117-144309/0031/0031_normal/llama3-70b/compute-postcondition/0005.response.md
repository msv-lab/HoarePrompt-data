The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is 2. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` becomes 1 * 2 = 2. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 2, `i` is 0**
