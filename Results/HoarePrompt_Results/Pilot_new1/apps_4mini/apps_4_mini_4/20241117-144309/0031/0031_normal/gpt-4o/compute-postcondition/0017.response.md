According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the current loop index, which is `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. 

Since we don't have the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can infer that for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means it should be updated to `i + 1`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `k`, which implies that `k` must be greater than `i`. 

State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is i, `k` is greater than i**
