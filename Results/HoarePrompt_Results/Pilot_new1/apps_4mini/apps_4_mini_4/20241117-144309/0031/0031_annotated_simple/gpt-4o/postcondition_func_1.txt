The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates certain values based on combinatorial logic and prints the results in the form of two integers derived from these calculations. The function does not return any value.
