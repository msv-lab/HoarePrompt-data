According to the code, the loop iterates `k` times, controlled by the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `k` is greater than 1, we need to adjust the state for `i` to be 3, which is one more than the current value of `i`. 

No other states need to be adjusted because the values of `n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` do not affect the loop's ability to execute again in this context. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 1, `total_days` is \( 2^n \), `numerator` is \( (2^n \times (2^n - 1)) \times (2^n - 2) \), `denominator` is \( 2^{3n} \), `i` is 3**
