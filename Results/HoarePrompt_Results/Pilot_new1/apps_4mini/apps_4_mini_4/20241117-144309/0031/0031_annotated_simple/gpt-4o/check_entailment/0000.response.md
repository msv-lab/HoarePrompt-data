To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and the implementation closely.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to compute the probability that at least two of `k` people share the same birthday, given that there are `2^n` possible birthdays. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction `A/B`, where `A` and `B` are coprime before taking modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: Computes the GCD of two numbers. This function seems correct and serves its purpose well.

2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - It first checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If true, it prints `1 1`, indicating that there is guaranteed to be at least one shared birthday, which is correct.
   - It then calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 1 << n` (which is `2^n`).
   - It calculates the numerator and denominator for the probability using a loop. The numerator represents the successful arrangements of birthdays where no two people share a birthday, while the denominator represents the total possible arrangements.
   - After computing `p_no_shared` and `p_total`, it calculates `p_shared` and sets `A` and `B` accordingly.
   - Finally, it reduces `A` and `B` by their GCD and prints them modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Edge Cases
1. **When `k` is greater than `2^n`**: The program correctly handles this case by printing `1 1`.
  
2. **When `k = 2` and `n = 1`**: 
   - Here, `total_days = 2^1 = 2`. The probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is `1/2`. The program should output `1 2`, but it will output `1 1` if the check for `k > 2^n` is not satisfied and the loop runs. This is an issue because the logic doesn't handle this case correctly.

3. **When `k = 3` and `n = 1`**: 
   - Again, `total_days = 2^1 = 2`, and with 3 people, it is guaranteed that at least two will share a birthday. The expected output is `1 1`, which is correct.

4. **When `k = 3` and `n = 2`**: 
   - Here, `total_days = 2^2 = 4`. The probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is `1 - (4 * 3 * 2)/(4^3) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4`. The expected output should be `3 4`, but the program may not reach this correctly depending on the calculations.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly compute the probability for all cases, particularly when `k` is less than or equal to `2^n` but greater than 2. The handling of the probability calculation is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.

Given that there are inputs for which the program does not work as expected, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
