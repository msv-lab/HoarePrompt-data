The `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is `2**n`, and the current value of `denominator` is `2**n`. Therefore, after executing the line of code, `denominator` will be updated to `2**n * 2**n`, which simplifies to `2**(2*n)`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n` times (2 raised to the power of `n` - 1), `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of (2*n), `i` is 1**
