The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraint that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than \(2^n\), the function prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is not greater than \(2^n\), the function does not execute any further actions and does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` exceeds \(2^n\), it prints (1, 1) and exits; otherwise, it performs no further actions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and if `k` is greater than \(2^n\), it prints (1, 1) and returns; otherwise, it does not perform any further actions.**
