The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`. Since `n` is an integer within the range from 1 to 10^18, `total_days` will be a very large integer representing \(2\) raised to the power of \(n\). The value of `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `total_days` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), `total_days` is 2 ** n**
