According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the result of the operation `a % b`, which is less than the previous value of `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be greater than 0.

Since `b` is currently less than its previous value, we need to ensure that the previous value of `b` was greater than 0. Therefore, we can adjust the state to indicate that the previous value of `b` was greater than 0, while `b` itself remains non-zero.

State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the result of the operation `a % b`, and the previous value of `b` is greater than 0**
