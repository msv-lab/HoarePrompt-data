Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * (k - 1)), (d * k + 1)], `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is 0. If `remainder` is 0, the loop or statement is exited immediately. If `remainder` is greater than 0, the loop continues, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
