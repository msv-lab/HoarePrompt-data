The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment where `a` and `b` are updated. The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, and the new value of `b` becomes the remainder of the division of the old value of `a` by the old value of `b`. However, the initial values of `a` and `b` are not provided, only that they are positive integers.

Since `n` and `k` are positive integers, we can assume that `a` and `b` could be assigned the values of `n` and `k` in some context. However, without specific initial values for `a` and `b`, we cannot determine the exact values after execution. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to `a % b`, but we cannot specify exact values without knowing the initial values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the result of the operation `a % b`**
