According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which is the starting point of the loop. Since the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to -1 after the current iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `i` will be decremented to -1 after the current iteration.
2. The loop will not execute again since `i` will be less than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted as they remain unchanged during the loop's execution.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * (k - 1)), (d * k + 1)], `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is -1, and `sequence[0]` is incremented by 1.**
