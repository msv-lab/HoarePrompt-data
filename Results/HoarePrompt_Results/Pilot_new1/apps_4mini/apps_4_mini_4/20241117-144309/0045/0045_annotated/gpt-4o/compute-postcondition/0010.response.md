Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * k)], `i` is `k - 1`. If the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the condition for further processing has been met. Otherwise, the program remains in its current state without breaking, awaiting further conditions or iterations.***
