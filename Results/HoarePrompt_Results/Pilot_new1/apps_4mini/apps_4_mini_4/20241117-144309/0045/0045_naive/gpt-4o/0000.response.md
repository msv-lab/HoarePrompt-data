To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and identify any potential edge cases or missing scenarios.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n` and have the maximal greatest common divisor (GCD).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program first calculates the minimum sum required for `k` strictly increasing positive integers, which is given by the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to form such a sequence.
   - It then calculates how many times this minimum sequence can be scaled by `d = n // min_sum`.
   - The remainder `remainder = n - d * min_sum` is then used to adjust the sequence to ensure the sum is exactly `n`.
   - The sequence is generated as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which ensures the initial sequence is strictly increasing.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last elements of the sequence to account for any leftover sum from the remainder.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `n`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 6`, the minimum sum needed is `21`, which exceeds `5`. The program correctly returns `-1` in this case, but it does not explicitly handle the situation where `k` is greater than `n` leading to an impossible scenario.
   - The program may not correctly adjust the sequence when the `remainder` is significant, potentially leading to a situation where the sequence remains valid but does not maximize the GCD as intended.

4. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - If we take `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the minimum sum required is `15`, which is greater than `10`, so the output should be `-1`, and the program handles this correctly.
   - If `n = 10` and `k = 2`, the minimum sum is `3`, so the sequence `[1, 2]` is valid but not optimal for maximizing GCD. The program outputs `[5, 5]`, which is not strictly increasing.

5. **Conclusion**: 
Given the analysis, the program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when it comes to ensuring the sequence is strictly increasing while also maximizing the GCD. There are potential outputs where the sequence does not meet the strictly increasing requirement.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails in cases where it generates a sequence that does not strictly increase, such as when `n = 10` and `k = 2`, where it could output `[5, 5]` instead of a valid strictly increasing sequence.
