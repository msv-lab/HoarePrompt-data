The values of `a` and `b` are assigned as follows: `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. Given that `a` is `k` and `b` is `n % k`, we can compute the new values.

1. `a` is assigned the value of `b`, which is `n % k`.
2. `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, which is `k % (n % k)`.

Since `n` is not a multiple of `k`, `n % k` is not 0, and thus `k % (n % k)` will yield a value less than `n % k`.

Therefore, the output state becomes: `a` is `n % k`, `b` is `k % (n % k)`.

Output State: **`a` is `n % k`, `b` is `k % (n % k)`**
