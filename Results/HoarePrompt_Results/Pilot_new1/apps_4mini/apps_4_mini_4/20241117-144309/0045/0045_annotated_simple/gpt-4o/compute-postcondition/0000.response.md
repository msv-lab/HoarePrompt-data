The code calculates `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The value of `k` is a positive integer within the range specified (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10). The calculation involves multiplying `k` by `k + 1` and then performing integer division by 2. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation.

Since the specific value of `k` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `min_sum`, but we know it will be a positive integer based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2**
