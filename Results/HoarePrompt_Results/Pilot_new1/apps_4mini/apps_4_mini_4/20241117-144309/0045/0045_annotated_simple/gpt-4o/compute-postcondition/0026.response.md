The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). 

In Case 1, if the minimum required sum `min_sum` (calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum required sum exceeds the available sum. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return anything, implying that the program continues executing without any specific output from this conditional check.

In Case 2, the function returns the modified sequence if a certain condition (remainder) is greater than 0, or the unchanged sequence if the remainder is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, check if the minimum required sum exceeds `n`, and based on a condition involving a remainder, return either a modified sequence or an unchanged sequence. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It returns -1 if the minimum required sum exceeds `n`. If the minimum required sum does not exceed `n`, it continues execution without returning anything. It also returns a modified sequence if a certain condition is met, or an unchanged sequence if that condition is not met.**
