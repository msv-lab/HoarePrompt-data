The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` simultaneously assigns `b` to `a` and `a % b` to `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are not provided in the initial state, but they are both positive integers. The operation `a % b` computes the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. 

Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, the updated values of `a` and `b` will depend on their initial values. However, without specific values for `a` and `b`, we can only describe the effect of the operation.

The output state will indicate that `a` takes the value of the initial `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. 

Output State: **`a` is the initial value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the initial `a` divided by the initial `b`**
