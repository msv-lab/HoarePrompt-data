The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if `min_sum`, calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum sum required exceeds `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, there is no return value specified, and the function continues execution without returning -1.

In Case 2, the function returns a modified sequence that reflects the distribution of the remainder across the first `k` multiples of `d`, or it returns the unchanged sequence if the remainder is 0 or if `k` is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and based on the value of `min_sum`, it either returns -1 if the minimum sum exceeds `n`, or it proceeds to return a modified sequence reflecting the distribution of the remainder, or the unchanged sequence if certain conditions are met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It returns -1 if the minimum sum required exceeds `n`. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, it returns a modified sequence reflecting the distribution of the remainder or the unchanged sequence depending on the conditions.**
