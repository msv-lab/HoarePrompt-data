Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop is exited; otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking.***
