The code assigns `b` to `a` and `a % b` to `b`. Given that `a` is the initial value of `b` and `b` is greater than 0, we can denote the initial values as `a = b_initial` and `b = b_initial > 0`. 

After the execution:
- The new value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b`, which is `b_initial`.
- The new value of `b` becomes `a % b`. Since `a` was initially `b_initial` and `b` is `b_initial`, the calculation `a % b` equals `b_initial % b_initial`, which is `0`.

Therefore, the output state is:
`a` is `b_initial`, `b` is `0`.

Output State: **`a` is the initial value of `b`, `b` is 0**
