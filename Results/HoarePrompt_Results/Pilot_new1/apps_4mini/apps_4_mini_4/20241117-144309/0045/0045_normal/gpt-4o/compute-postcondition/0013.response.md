According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts at `k - 1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `k - 2`. 

The other states, such as `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder`, do not need to change because they are not directly affected by the loop's execution condition. 

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
