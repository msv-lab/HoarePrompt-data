The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially 0, it returns `a` as the GCD. The function does not enforce that `a` and `b` are positive integers, so it can also handle non-positive integers, returning the absolute value of the GCD for negative inputs.
