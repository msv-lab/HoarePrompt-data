Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`. If `remainder` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that `n` is perfectly divisible by `min_sum`. If `remainder` is not 0, the loop or if statement continues, and the state of `sequence`, which is a list of the first `k` multiples of `d`, remains unchanged. The value of `i` is `k - 1`.***
