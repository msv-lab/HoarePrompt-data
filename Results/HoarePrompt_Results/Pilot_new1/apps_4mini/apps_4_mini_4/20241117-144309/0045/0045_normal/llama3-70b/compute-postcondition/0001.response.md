According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the remainder of the initial `a` divided by the initial `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be greater than 0.

Since `b` is the remainder of `a` divided by its initial value, the only way for `b` to be non-zero is if `a` is not a multiple of the initial value of `b`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the initial value of `b` is not equal to 0 and that `a` is not a multiple of the initial value of `b`.

State: **`a` is the initial value of `b`, `b` is greater than 0**
