The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The previous value of `divisors` contains the value 1 if `x` is 1 and the value 2 if `i` is 2. The variable `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be added to `divisors`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `divisors` now contains the additional value of `i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now includes `i` along with its previous values.**
