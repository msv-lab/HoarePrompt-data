The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is an integer that is expected to be between 2 and 500. The function processes this integer along with additional constraints on `K` and `A`, which are not directly passed as parameters but are implied to be part of the function's context. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list of the divisors in descending order from the set 'divisors'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept an integer `x` and return a sorted list of its divisors in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is an integer between 2 and 500, and returns a sorted list of its divisors in descending order.**
