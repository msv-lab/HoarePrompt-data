Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i` if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged. Overall, `max_divisor` reflects the maximum divisor found based on the calculations involving `gcd` and `i`, considering both cases where `i * i` is equal to or not equal to `gcd`.***
