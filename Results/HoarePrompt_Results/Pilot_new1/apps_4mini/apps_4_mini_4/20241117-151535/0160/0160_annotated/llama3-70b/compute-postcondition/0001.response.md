The code assigns `A` the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The input provides a series of integers, which will populate the list `A`. The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `A` is now a list of integers based on the provided input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, and `A` is a list of integers from input.**
