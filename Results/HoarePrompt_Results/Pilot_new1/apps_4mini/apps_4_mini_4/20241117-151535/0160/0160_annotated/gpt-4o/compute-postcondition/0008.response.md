The code snippet adds the value `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The previous values of `divisors` are not specified, but it is mentioned that `divisors` now includes `i` along with its previous values. 

Since `x` and `i` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific result of `x // i`. However, we can conclude that the set `divisors` will now contain an additional element, which is the result of the integer division.

Thus, the output state reflects the inclusion of this new value into `divisors`, while other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` now includes `x // i` along with its previous values.**
