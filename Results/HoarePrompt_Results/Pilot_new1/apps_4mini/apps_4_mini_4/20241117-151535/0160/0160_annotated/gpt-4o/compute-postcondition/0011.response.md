The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `i` is the next value (previous value + 1), but we do not know its specific value. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `i` has been added to `divisors`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is the next value (previous value + 1), and `i` has been added to `divisors`.**
