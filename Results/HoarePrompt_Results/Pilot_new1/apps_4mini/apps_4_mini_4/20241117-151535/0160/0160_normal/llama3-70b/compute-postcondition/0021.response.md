The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. Given that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 2, the value of `gcd // i` will be at least 0.5 (but as an integer division, it will be at least 0). Therefore, `max_divisor` will either remain the same or be updated to `gcd // 2`. The previous value of `max_divisor` could be `gcd` or 2, whichever is greater. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the new value of `max_divisor` based on the maximum calculation. 

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd // 2` or remains the same, `i` is 2**
