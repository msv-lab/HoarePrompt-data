Output State: **`divisors` includes all positive divisors of `K`, which are the integers `i` and `K // i` for each `i` that divides `K` evenly up to the square root of `K`. If `K` is 1, the loop executes only once, and `divisors` will contain just 1. If `K` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `K` is negative, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set.**
