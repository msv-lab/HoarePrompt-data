Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` includes the integers 1 and `K`. If `K` is even (i.e., `x` is divisible by 2), then `divisors` also includes 2 and `K // 2`. If `K` is odd, `divisors` remains unchanged from its initial values of 1 and `K`.***
