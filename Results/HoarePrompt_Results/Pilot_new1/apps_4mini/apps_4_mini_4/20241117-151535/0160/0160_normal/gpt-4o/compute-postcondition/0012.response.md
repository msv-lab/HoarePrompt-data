The code snippet adds the value of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x`, which is at least `(i + 1)`, and `i`, which is an integer. The exact values of `x` and `i` are not provided, but we know that `x // i` will yield an integer result based on the division of `x` by `i`.

Since `divisors` already includes integers 1 and `K`, the addition of `x // i` will not affect those values but will modify the `divisors` set by including the new value. The output state will reflect the updated contents of `divisors`, which now includes `x // i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` includes the integers 1, `K`, and `i`, and now includes `x // i`**.
