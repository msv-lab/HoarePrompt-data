According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `gcd`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that it is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. 

Since the loop iterates up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Thus, we need to adjust the state for `i` to `i + 1` and ensure that `gcd` is such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least `i + 1`. 

The state of `gcd` does not need to be changed as it is already greater than or equal to 1 and does not affect the condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is updated to `i + 1`**
