According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The loop variable `i` takes values starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value of `int(math.sqrt(x))`, meaning it has just completed the last valid iteration. Therefore, to allow for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Additionally, since `x` must remain the same for the loop to continue executing under the same conditions, there are no changes needed for `x`, `N`, `K`, or `A`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that may contain the integer `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**
