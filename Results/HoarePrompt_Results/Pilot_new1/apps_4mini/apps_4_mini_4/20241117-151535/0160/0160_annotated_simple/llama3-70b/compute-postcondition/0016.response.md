The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. The initial value of `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, and `i` is 1. Since the product of `i` and `i` is not equal to `gcd`, it implies that `gcd` is greater than 1. Therefore, `gcd // i` is equal to `gcd // 1`, which is `gcd`. 

As a result, `max(max_divisor, gcd // i)` will evaluate to `max(gcd, gcd)`, which is still `gcd`. Thus, the value of `max_divisor` remains unchanged. 

The output state is: `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` remains unchanged**
