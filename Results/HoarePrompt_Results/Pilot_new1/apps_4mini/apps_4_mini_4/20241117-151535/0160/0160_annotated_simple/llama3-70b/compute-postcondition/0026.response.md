The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 4 and `i` is 3, `gcd // i` will yield a value that is at least `4 // 3`, which is 1. The exact value of `gcd // i` depends on the specific value of `gcd`, but it will always be an integer. 

Thus, `max(max_divisor, gcd // i)` will be calculated based on the initial value of `max_divisor` and the computed value of `gcd // i`. The state of `i` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum value between its initial state and `gcd // i`, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum value between its initial state and `gcd // i`, `i` is 3**
