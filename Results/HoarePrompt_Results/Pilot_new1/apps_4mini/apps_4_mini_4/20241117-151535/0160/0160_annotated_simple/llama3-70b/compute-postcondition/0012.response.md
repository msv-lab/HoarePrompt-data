According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `gcd`. The loop will execute if `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1, which requires `gcd` to be at least 1. 

Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, we need to ensure that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, the loop starts with `i` initialized to 1.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `gcd` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` (where `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1), `i` is 1**
