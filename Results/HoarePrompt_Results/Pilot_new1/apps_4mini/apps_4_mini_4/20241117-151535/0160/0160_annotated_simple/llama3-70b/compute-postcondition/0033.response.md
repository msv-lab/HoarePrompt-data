The function `func` accepts two integers, `N` and `K`, and a list of `N` integers `A`. It computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in `A`. After determining the gcd, it finds the largest divisor of the gcd that is less than or equal to its square root. Finally, it prints this largest divisor. 

However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Additionally, the parameter `K` is not used in any calculations or logic, making it irrelevant in the context of this function. The function also does not handle cases where `N` is less than 1, which could lead to accessing an index that does not exist in the list `A`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `N` and `K`, and a list of `N` integers `A`, computes the gcd of the elements in `A`, finds the largest divisor of this gcd that is less than or equal to its square root, and prints this divisor. The parameter `K` is unused, and the function does not handle cases where `N` is less than 1. **
