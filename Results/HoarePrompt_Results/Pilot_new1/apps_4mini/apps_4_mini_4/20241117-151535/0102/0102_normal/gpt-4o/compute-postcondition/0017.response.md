Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9 (inclusive), the function returns the string representation of `s` from the list `ones`. If `s` is between 11 and 19 (inclusive), the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99 (inclusive) but not in the `teens`, and if `s` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `s` from the `tens` list. If `s` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `s` in the format `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`. The function does not execute for values of `s` less than 0 or greater than 99, nor for values of `s` between 11 and 19, as these are excluded by the precondition.***
