Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If `s` is less than 20, the function prints the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the function prints the string representation of `s` using the `tens` list for the tens place and the `ones` list for the ones place, with a hyphen separating them if `s` is not a multiple of 10.***
