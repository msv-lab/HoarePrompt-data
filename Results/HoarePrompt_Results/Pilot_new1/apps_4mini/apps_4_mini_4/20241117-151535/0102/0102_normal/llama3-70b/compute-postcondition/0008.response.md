The `print(teens[s - 10])` statement accesses the `teens` list using the index `s - 10`. Since `s` is an integer between 10 and 19, the value of `s - 10` will range from 0 to 9. The `teens` list contains the strings for the numbers from 10 to 19 at indices 0 to 9, respectively. Therefore, the output will be the string corresponding to the value of `s`.

The output state, considering that `s` is between 10 and 19, will reflect the specific value from the `teens` list based on the value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10 and less than 20, and the function prints the corresponding string from the `teens` list**.
