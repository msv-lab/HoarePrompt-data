Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99 and is not less than 11 or greater than 19. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `n` (tens[n // 10]). If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]', ensuring that all possible values of `n` within the specified range are correctly represented.***
