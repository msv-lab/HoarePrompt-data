Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation of `s` using the `tens` list for the tens place and the `ones` list for the ones place, with a hyphen separating them if `s` is not a multiple of 10. This covers all integer values for `s`, including edge cases for 0-9, 10-19, and values 20 and above.***
