The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English word representation based on specific ranges: it returns 'zero' to 'nine' for values between 0 and 9, 'eleven' to 'nineteen' for values between 11 and 19, the tens place word for multiples of ten between 10 and 99, and a hyphenated combination of the tens and ones words for values between 10 and 99 that are not multiples of ten. However, for values less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not return any value, leading to a potential case of returning `None`.
