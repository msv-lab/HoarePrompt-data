To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1(n)` is designed to convert an integer score `n` (where 0 ≤ n ≤ 99) into its English word representation. The function uses three lists: `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` to handle different ranges of numbers.

1. **For numbers 0-9**: The program correctly returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list. This is handled by the first `if` statement.

2. **For numbers 11-19**: The program correctly handles this range by returning the appropriate word from the `teens` list. This is done in the second `if` statement.

3. **For numbers 10 and 20-99**:
   - If `n` is a multiple of 10 (like 10, 20, 30, ..., 90), it correctly returns the corresponding word from the `tens` list.
   - If `n` is not a multiple of 10 (like 21, 22, ..., 29, 31, ..., 99), it constructs the word using both the `tens` and `ones` lists, joined by a hyphen.

However, there is a critical oversight in the code: it does not handle the case for the number 10 correctly. The number 10 is included in the range of 10-99 but is not specifically accounted for in the logic. The `tens` list has "ten" at index 1 (for 10), but the logic to return "ten" does not account for this scenario since it falls into the `else` block after checking for numbers 11 to 19.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
- If `n = 10`, the program will not return "ten" correctly because the logic skips over it. It will not match any of the conditions properly and may lead to an undefined behavior (or no return value).

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the input `10` correctly, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**
