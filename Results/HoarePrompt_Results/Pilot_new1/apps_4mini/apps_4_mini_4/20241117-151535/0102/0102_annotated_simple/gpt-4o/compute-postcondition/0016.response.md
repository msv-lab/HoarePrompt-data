Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `n` is larger than 9 and less than or equal to 99. If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list at index `n - 10`. If `n` is 10 or greater but not in the range of 11 to 19, and if `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string from the `tens` list at index `n // 10`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. For values of `n` less than 10 or greater than 99, the function does not execute and no return value is provided.***
