The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from `input()`, which accepts two integers separated by a space. The values are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^9\) and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 1 to 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer from 0 to 8**
