The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer from 3 to 10^9 + 2, after the execution, `n` will be in the range of 4 to 10^9 + 3. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer from 4 to 10^9 + 3; `k` is a non-negative integer from 0 to 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 4 to 10^9 + 3; `k` is a non-negative integer from 0 to 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
