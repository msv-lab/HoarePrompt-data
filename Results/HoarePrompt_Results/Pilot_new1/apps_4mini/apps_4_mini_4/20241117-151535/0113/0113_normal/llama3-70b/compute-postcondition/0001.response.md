The value of `x` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`. The value of `k` is an input non-negative integer between 0 and 8, so the possible values for `x` are powers of 10 from `10^0` (which is 1) to `10^8` (which is 100000000). The values of `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
