According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `n % x != 0`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must remain such that it is not divisible by `x`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `n + 1` is not divisible by `x`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be such that `n` is still not divisible by `x`. 

Since `n` is currently `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `n` itself is not divisible by `x`. Thus, we can express the condition as `n` must be such that `n % x != 0`.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `n` is now `n + 1` and `n` is not divisible by `x`**
