Output State: **`if n is such that n % x != 0, then n` will be incremented until it becomes divisible by `x`. At the end of the loop, `n` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the original `n` that is divisible by `x`. If `n` is already divisible by `x`, the loop will not execute, and `n` will remain unchanged.**
