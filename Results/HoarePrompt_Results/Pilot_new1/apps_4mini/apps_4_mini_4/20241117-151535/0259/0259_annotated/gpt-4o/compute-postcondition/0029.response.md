The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` and `t` are defined in the initial state, where `s_i` is an element from `bus_routes[i]` and `t` is a positive integer, the value of `wait_time` will depend on those specific values. Since `n` is greater than `i + 1`, it confirms that `i` is a valid index for accessing `bus_routes`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`**
