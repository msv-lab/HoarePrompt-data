The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the value of `wait_time` will be non-negative (either zero or positive). The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and the calculated `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t` (non-negative)**.
