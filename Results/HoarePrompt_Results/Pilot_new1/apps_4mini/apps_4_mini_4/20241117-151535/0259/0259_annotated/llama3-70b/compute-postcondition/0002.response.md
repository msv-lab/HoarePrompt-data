According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The variable `buses` is currently an empty list, but it does not affect the execution of the loop itself. The loop control variable is `_`, which indicates that the loop does not use the index value in its body.

Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, we need to maintain the current state of `n` and confirm that it is within the specified range. The variable `t` does not need to be adjusted as it does not impact the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list**
