Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the bus arrives exactly at time `t` (i.e., `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This covers all scenarios based on the relationship between `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`.***
