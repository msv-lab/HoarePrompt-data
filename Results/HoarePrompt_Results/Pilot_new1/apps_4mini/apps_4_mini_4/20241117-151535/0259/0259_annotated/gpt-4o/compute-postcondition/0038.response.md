Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from all bus routes based on their start times `s_i` and frequencies `d_i`, and `chosen_route` indicates the index of the bus route that provides this minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, and `chosen_route` remains -1. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes for all bus routes, and `min_wait_time` is updated to reflect the least wait time encountered, while `chosen_route` will be set to the index of the corresponding route.**
