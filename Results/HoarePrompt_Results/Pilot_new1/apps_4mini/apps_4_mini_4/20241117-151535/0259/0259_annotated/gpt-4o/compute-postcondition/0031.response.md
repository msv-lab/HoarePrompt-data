The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are known, as `t` is a positive integer and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. The specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` are not provided, but they are derived from the `bus_routes` array. The condition states that `n` is greater than `i + 1`, indicating that `i` is within valid bounds of the `bus_routes` list.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `wait_time` has been calculated based on the given formula, while `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
