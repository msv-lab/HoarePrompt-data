The function accepts no parameters directly but reads input values for `n` (the number of buses) and `t` (a time value). It then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the start time `s` and the duration `d` for each bus. The function calculates the minimum time it takes for any bus to arrive at time `t`, based on the formula `(t - s) % d`. It returns the 1-based index of the bus that has the minimum time. If no buses are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), it returns -1, indicating no bus is available.
