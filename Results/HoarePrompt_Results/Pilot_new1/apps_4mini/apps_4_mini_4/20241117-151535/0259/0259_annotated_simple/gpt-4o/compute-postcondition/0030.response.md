The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `wait_time` is now 0 while the other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `wait_time` is 0**
