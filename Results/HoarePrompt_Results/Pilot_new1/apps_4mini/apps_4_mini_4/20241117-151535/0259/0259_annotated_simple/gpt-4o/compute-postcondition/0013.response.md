Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[0]`. The `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, which indicates that the calculated `wait_time` is a non-negative integer equal to `s_i - t` if `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, or `wait_time` is 0 if `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, or `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` ensuring that `wait_time` is at least 1 otherwise.***
