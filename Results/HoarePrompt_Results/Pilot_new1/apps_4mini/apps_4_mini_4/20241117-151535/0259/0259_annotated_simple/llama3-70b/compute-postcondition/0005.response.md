According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, and since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, it must be adjusted accordingly. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still a positive integer, but to execute one more time, it must be incremented. 

However, since `n` is defined as a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100, for the loop to execute one more time, we would need to adjust `n` to be at least 2. The loop variable `_` does not affect the state we need to track.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is a list containing one tuple (s, d), where s and d are input integers.**
