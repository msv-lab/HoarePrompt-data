According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list contains at least 1 tuple, the loop can execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 and will represent the index of the current tuple being processed in the `buses` list. The tuple `(s, d)` will correspond to the first tuple in the list at the beginning of the loop. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `buses` is not empty, so it must contain at least 1 tuple. At the start of the loop, `i` will be 0, and `(s, d)` will be the first tuple in the `buses` list.

State: **`buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (s, d), `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in the buses list**
