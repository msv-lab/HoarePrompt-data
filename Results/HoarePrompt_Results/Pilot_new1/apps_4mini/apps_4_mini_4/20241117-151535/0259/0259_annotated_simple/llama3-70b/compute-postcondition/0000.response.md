The values of `n` and `t` are assigned from user input, where `input()` accepts a string that is split into two parts and converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. The initial values of `n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `t` as provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000)**
