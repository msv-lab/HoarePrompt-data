Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, indicating the index of the chosen bus route. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. All cases ensure that `wait_time` is a non-negative integer reflecting the necessary wait time until the next bus departs.***
