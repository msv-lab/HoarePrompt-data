Postcondition: ***`s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, the values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This ensures that `min_wait_time` always reflects the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions of bus arrival times in relation to `t`.***
