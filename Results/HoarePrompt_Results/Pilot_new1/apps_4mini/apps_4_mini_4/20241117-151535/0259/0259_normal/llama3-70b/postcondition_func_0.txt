The function accepts user input to read two integers `n` and `t`, where `n` represents the number of bus routes, and `t` is a time value. It then collects `n` tuples of integers `(s, d)` that represent the starting time and duration of each bus route. The function calculates the minimum time to wait for a bus based on the formula `(t - s) % d` for each bus route. It returns the 1-based index of the bus route that has the minimum wait time. If there are no bus routes (`n` is 0), it will output -1. The function does not handle invalid input or cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 100, nor does it validate the ranges for `s` and `d`.
