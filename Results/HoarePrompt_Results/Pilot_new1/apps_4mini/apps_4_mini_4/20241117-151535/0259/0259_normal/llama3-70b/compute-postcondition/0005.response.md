According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as the variable `_` (which typically represents the loop index) is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. Since the loop has executed `n` times, it means that the loop has completed its iterations and `_` has reached `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than the current value of `_`, which is `n`. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to at least `n + 1` to allow for one more iteration. The other variables `t`, `buses`, `s`, and `d` do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop execution directly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is [(s, d)], `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 100**
