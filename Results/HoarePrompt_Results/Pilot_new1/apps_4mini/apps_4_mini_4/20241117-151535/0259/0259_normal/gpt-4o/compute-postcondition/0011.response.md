Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and the first element `s_i` of the first tuple in `bus_routes` is less than `t`. If the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is always a positive integer reflecting the necessary wait time until the next bus departs.***
