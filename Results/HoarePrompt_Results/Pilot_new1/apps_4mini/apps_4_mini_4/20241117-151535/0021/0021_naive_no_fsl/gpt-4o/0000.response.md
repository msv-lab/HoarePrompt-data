To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The program receives an integer `n` which represents the size of the permutation.
2. It receives an array `a` of size `n` containing distinct integers from `1` to `n`.
3. The goal is to find the maximum distance between the minimum element (which is always `1`) and the maximum element (which is always `n`) after performing exactly one swap.

### Key Points:
- The minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) need to be as far apart as possible after one swap.
- The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions in the list.

### Program Analysis:
The program calculates the positions of the minimum and maximum elements using:
- `min_pos = a.index(1)` for the position of the minimum element (1).
- `max_pos = a.index(n)` for the position of the maximum element (n).

Then it calculates four potential distances:
1. Distance if the minimum element is swapped with the first element (position 0).
2. Distance if the maximum element is swapped with the last element (position n-1).
3. Distance if the maximum element is swapped with the first element (position 0).
4. Distance if the minimum element is swapped with the last element (position n-1).

Finally, it takes the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Already Optimal Configuration**: If the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the array (e.g., `1` at index `0` and `n` at index `n-1`), the program still calculates distances that include unnecessary swaps, which would not change the distance but would still produce a valid output.

2. **Single Swap Consideration**: The program does not explicitly ensure that the swap is between the minimum and maximum elements. In cases where the minimum and maximum are not at the ends, it might suggest suboptimal swaps that do not maximize the distance.

3. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The logic does not consider that the maximum distance achievable by a swap should always involve either moving `1` to the start or `n` to the end, or vice versa. The distances calculated do not guarantee that the swap directly increases the distance between `1` and `n`.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 3 5 4 2
```
Here, `1` is at index `0` and `5` is at index `2`. The maximum distance is currently `2`. If we swap `5` and `2`, then `1` will be at index `0` and `5` will be at index `4`, resulting in a distance of `4`. However, the program will only consider distances involving the first and last elements, leading to an incorrect maximum distance.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not accurately calculate the maximum distance that can be achieved by a swap between the minimum and maximum elements. It fails to account for all necessary swaps to ensure the maximum distance is achieved.

Correctness: **False**
