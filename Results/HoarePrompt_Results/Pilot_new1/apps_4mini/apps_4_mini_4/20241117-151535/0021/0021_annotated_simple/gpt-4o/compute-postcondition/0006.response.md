The variable `dist3` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - min_pos)`, which calculates the absolute difference between `0` and `min_pos`. The value of `min_pos` is known, so `dist3` will be equal to `min_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of integer n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of integer n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `min_pos**
