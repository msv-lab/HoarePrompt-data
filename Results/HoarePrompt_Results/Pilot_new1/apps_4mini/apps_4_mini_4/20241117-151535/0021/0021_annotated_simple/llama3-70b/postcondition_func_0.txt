The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the input, finds the positions of `1` and `n`, calculates the maximum and minimum distances based on their positions, and prints the maximum of these distances. It does not handle cases where `1` or `n` are not present in the list, nor does it validate the input constraints.
