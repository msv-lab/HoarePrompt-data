The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is constrained to be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, the output state will reflect that `n` now holds this input integer value. The other variable `a` remains unaffected at this point as the code does not manipulate it. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n**
