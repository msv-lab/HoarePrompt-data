The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, but the specific value of `n` after the input is unknown. The list `a` remains unaffected as it is not modified in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing a permutation of size n.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing a permutation of size n.**
