The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The value of `max_pos` is determined by the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. However, since the specific value of `max_pos` is not provided, we can only express `dist1` in terms of `max_pos`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between `dist1` and `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is the list of `n` distinct integers provided by the user, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`**.
