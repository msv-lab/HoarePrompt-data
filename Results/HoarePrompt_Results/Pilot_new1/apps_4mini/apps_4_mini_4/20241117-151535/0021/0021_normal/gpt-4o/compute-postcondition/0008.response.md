The code assigns `max_distance` the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The previous values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are not provided, except that `dist4` is calculated as `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`, where `n` is an input integer and `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`. Therefore, `max_distance` will be determined based on these values.

Since the specific values of `dist1`, `dist2`, and `dist3` are unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `max_distance`. However, we know that `dist4` is defined.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos`; `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`**.
