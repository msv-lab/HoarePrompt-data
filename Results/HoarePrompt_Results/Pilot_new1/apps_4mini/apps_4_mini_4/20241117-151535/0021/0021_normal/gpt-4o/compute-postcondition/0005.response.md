Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is the list of `n` distinct integers provided by the user; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`**
