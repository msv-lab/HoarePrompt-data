The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is specified to be an integer between 2 and 100, the value of `n` will be within this range after the assignment. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n**
