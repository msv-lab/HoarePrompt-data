The code assigns `posn` the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Given that `a` contains all integers from 1 to `n`, the index of `n` in `a` will be `n - 1` (since list indexing starts at 0). The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (an integer between 2 and 100) and `a` (a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n`). 

Thus, after execution, `posn` will hold the value `n - 1`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is `n - 1`**
