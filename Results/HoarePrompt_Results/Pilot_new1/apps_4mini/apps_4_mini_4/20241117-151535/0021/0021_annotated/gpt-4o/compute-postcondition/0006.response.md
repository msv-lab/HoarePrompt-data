To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from user input.
   - `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.
   - `dist1` is assigned the value of `max_pos`.
   - `dist2` is calculated as `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)` introduces a new variable `dist3`.
   - However, `min_pos` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of `dist3`.

Since `min_pos` is undefined, we cannot compute `dist3`. The output state will reflect the values of the defined variables and indicate the issue with `min_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `min_pos` is undefined, thus `dist3` cannot be calculated.**
