The function `func` accepts an integer input `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`, which contains all distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list `a`, and then computes two distances: `max_dist` and `min_dist`, based on the absolute difference between these positions and the value of `n`. Finally, it prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

However, the function does not handle cases where the input format might be incorrect, such as if the user does not provide enough integers in the list `a` or if the integers are not distinct. Additionally, it assumes the input will always include the integers 1 and `n`, which may not always be the case depending on user input.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`, calculates the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, computes two distances based on these positions, and prints the maximum of a calculated distance and a derived distance. It does not handle potential input errors or cases where the integers 1 or `n` are not present in the list. **
