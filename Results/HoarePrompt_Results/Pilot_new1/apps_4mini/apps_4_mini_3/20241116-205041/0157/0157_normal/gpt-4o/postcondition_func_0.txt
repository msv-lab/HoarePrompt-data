The function accepts three integers from user input, representing the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the available fruits, where each lemon requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. It then calculates the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons and prints this total. The function does not return any value. Note that the function does not handle cases where the inputs are not within the expected range (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) or if the inputs are invalid (e.g., non-integer values).
