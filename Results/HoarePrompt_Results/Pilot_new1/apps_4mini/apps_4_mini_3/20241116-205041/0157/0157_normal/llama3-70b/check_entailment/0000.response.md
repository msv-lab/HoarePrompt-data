To begin, let's analyze the provided program and the problem description.

**Problem Description Recap:**
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). The compote requires the fruits in the ratio of 1:2:4. The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote, based on these ratios.

**Program Code:**
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

**Output Hints:**
The function calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) that can be made with the available quantities. It prints the total number of fruits used in these complete sets.

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients by using the formula `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This ensures that we do not exceed the available quantity of any fruit based on the required ratios.
2. The total number of fruits used is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`, correctly reflecting the total fruits used in the sets.

**Edge Cases:**
1. If any of the fruits (lemons, apples, or pears) are insufficient to make even one complete set, the program should return 0. The calculation of `min_lemon` will handle this correctly as it will be 0 if any fruit is insufficient.
2. The program does not handle cases where input values are outside the specified range (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000), but since the problem guarantees valid input, this is not a concern for correctness.

**Output Hints Verification:**
The output hints state that the function calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients and prints the total number of fruits used. This agrees with the code, as it accurately computes the total number of fruits based on the complete sets determined by the minimum of the available quantities.

**Conclusion:**
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly handles all specified cases, including edge cases where insufficient fruits prevent making any compote. There are no apparent flaws or missed edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
