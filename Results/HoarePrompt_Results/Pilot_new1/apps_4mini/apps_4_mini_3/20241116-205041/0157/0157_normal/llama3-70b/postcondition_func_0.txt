The function accepts three integer inputs from the user, representing quantities of lemons, apples, and pears. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients that can be made using these quantities, where each set requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. It then prints the total number of fruits used in these complete sets, which is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. Note that the function does not explicitly handle cases where the inputs are outside the range of 1 to 1000, and it does not return any values; it only prints the result.
