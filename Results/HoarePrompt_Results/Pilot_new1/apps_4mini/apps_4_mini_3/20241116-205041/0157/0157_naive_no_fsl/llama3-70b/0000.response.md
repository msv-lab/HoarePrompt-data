To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it adheres to the problem description and handles all potential edge cases.

The problem states that Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The fruits must be in the ratio of 1:2:4 to make the compote. This means:
- For each lemon, there should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears.

The program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`) based on the available fruits, using the formula:
```python
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
```
Then it computes the total number of fruits used in the compote as:
```python
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```
This simplifies to:
```python
print(min_lemon * 7)
```
This correctly reflects the total number of fruits used based on the number of lemons.

Now, let's consider edge cases:
1. If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 4`, the output should be `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is correct.
2. If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the output should be `0` since there are not enough apples or pears.
3. If `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`, the output should also be `0`, but this case is not valid since the problem states the inputs are positive integers.

However, the input constraints specify that `a`, `b`, and `c` are all positive integers (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000). Thus, the program does not handle the case where the ingredients are insufficient to make any compote correctly.

Also, since the program does not check for invalid input cases or handle the case where not enough fruits are available to make even one complete set (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears), it could lead to incorrect outputs in some edge cases.

For example:
- If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`, the program would output `7`, but it should output `0` because there are not enough pears.

Therefore, the program fails to handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
