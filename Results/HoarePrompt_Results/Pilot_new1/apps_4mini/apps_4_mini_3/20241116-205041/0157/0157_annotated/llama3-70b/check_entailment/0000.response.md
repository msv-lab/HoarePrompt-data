To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the code and the associated annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay wants to make a compote with a specific ratio of fruits:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

Given the quantities of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c), we need to find the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote while adhering to the required ratios. If he can't use any fruits, the output should be 0.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. The program reads three integers from input representing the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. It calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum of:
   - `a` (lemons available)
   - `b // 2` (how many lemons can be supported by the available apples)
   - `c // 4` (how many lemons can be supported by the available pears)
3. The total fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`
   - This simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7`.

### Annotations Review:
- The annotations state that the function calculates the number of lemonades based on the available ingredients, which is misleading since the problem is about making compote, not lemonade.
- The annotations also mention that if there are not enough pears, the output should be 0, which aligns with the problem description.

### Example Cases:
1. **Input:**
   ```
   2
   5
   7
   ```
   - Here, `min_lemon = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`.
   - Total = `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`. This is correct.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   4
   7
   13
   ```
   - `min_lemon = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`.
   - Total = `3 + 6 + 12 = 21`. This is correct.

3. **Input:**
   ```
   2
   3
   2
   ```
   - `min_lemon = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`.
   - Total = `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`. This is correct.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the case where one type of fruit is insufficient to meet the required ratios (e.g., not enough pears).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratios. It handles all potential edge cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
