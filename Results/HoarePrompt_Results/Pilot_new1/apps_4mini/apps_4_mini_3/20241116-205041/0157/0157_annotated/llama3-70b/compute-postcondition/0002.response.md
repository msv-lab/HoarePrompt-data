The variable `c` is assigned a new value from `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `c` is not known, but it must be a positive integer within 1 to 1000. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer within 1 to 1000, `c` is a new positive integer within 1 to 1000**
