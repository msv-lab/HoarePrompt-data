The value of `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `b` is unknown, but it is stated that `b` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000. Therefore, after execution, `b` will be assigned a new input integer value within that range. The values of `a` and `c` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer within 1 to 1000, `c` is a positive integer within 1 to 1000**
