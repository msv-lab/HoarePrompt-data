The function prompts the user to input three integers, calculates the minimum number of lemonades that can be made based on the available ingredients (with `a` representing lemons, `b` representing sugar, and `c` representing water), and then prints the total amount of lemonade produced, which is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. The function does not return a value.
