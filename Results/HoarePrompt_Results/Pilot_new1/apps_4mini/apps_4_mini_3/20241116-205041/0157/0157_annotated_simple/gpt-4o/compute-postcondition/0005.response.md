To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, `total_fruits` is `7 * max_lemons`.

The code snippet is:
```
print(total_fruits)
```

1. `max_lemons` is computed as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. `total_fruits` is calculated as `7 * max_lemons`.
3. The `print` statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`.

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, we cannot determine their specific values without actual inputs. However, we can still describe the output state based on the relationships defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is 7 * max_lemons**.
