The function accepts three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruit that can be made using the constraints that each set requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The function then prints the total number of fruits used in these sets, which is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, where `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The function does not handle cases where the inputs are not positive integers or outside the specified range.
