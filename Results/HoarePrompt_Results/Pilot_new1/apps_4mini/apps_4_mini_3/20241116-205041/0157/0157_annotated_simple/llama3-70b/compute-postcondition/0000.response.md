The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged, and since `a` is a positive integer, it will take on a value between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` as well as the unchanged values of `b` and `c`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
