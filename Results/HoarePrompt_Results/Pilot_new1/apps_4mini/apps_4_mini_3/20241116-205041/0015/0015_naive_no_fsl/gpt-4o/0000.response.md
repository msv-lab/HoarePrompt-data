Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when `c` is zero and `a` is not equal to `b`. According to the problem description, if the difference `c` is zero, the sequence consists of the single element `a`. Therefore, if `b` is not equal to `a`, the output should be "NO". However, the program currently outputs "NO" in this case, which is correct. 

The issue arises when `c` is not zero, and `b` is less than `a`. The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`. The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` is not sufficient to ensure that `b` can be reached in the sequence. Specifically, if `c` is positive and `b` is less than `a`, the program will incorrectly return "NO" instead of "YES" even though `b` can be part of the sequence generated by starting at `a` and decrementing by `c`.

For example:
- Input: `10 5 5`
- Expected Output: `YES` (the sequence would be 10, 5, 0, -5, ...)
- Actual Output: `NO` (the program would evaluate `(5 - 10) % 5 == 0` which is true, but `(5 - 10) / 5 >= 0` is false)

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
