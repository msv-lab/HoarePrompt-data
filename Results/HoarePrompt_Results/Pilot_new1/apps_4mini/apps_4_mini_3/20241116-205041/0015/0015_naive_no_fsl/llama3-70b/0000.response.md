Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - The sequence is constant, consisting of the value `a` repeated indefinitely.
   - The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This is correct as `b` can only appear in the sequence if it is equal to `a`.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to determine if `b` can be reached from `a` by taking steps of size `c`. This ensures that `b` is indeed part of the sequence.
   - Additionally, it checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which ensures that the index `i` (where `s_i = b`) is a positive integer. This is necessary because the problem states that `i` must be a positive integer.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including:
- When `c` is zero and `a` is equal to `b`.
- When `c` is zero and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- When `c` is positive or negative, ensuring that the sequence correctly moves in the right direction towards `b`.

Since the program correctly handles all specified cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement, it is deemed correct.
