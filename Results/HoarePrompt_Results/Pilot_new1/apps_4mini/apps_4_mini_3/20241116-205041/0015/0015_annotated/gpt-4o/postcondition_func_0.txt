The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input. It prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of the division is non-negative; if both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This covers all cases, including when `c` is positive or negative, and when `(b - a)` can be positive, zero, or negative. The function does not return any value.
