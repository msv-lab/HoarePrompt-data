The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and checks the relationship between them. If `c` is 0, it outputs 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, and 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it outputs 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division is non-negative; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any values but instead prints the results directly.
