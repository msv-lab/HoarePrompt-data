The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and since `b` is equal to `a`, this relationship still holds. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `b` is equal to `a`; 'YES' has been printed.**
