The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables, while the print statement produces an output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0; and the function prints 'NO'**.
