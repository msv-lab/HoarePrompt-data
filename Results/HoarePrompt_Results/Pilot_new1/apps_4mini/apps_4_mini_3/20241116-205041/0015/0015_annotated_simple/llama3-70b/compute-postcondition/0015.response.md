Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, or 'NO' if they are not. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of the division is non-negative; it prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
