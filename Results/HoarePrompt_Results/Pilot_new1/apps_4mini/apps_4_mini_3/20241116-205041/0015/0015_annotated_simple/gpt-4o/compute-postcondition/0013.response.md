Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed if the difference `b - a` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This accounts for all cases, including when `b` is less than, greater than, or equal to `a`, as well as when `c` is zero or non-zero.***
