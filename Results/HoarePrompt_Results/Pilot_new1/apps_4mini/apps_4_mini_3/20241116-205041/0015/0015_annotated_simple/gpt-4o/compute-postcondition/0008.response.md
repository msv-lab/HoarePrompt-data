The code simply prints 'YES' to the output. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change as a result of this operation, and the conditions described in the initial state confirm that the print statement will execute without any issues. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the unchanged variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference `b - a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; and the output is 'YES'**
