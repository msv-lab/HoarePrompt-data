The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates independently of any external input values. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to execute its internal logic without requiring any arguments. Since there is no output specified in the prompt, we cannot determine a return value or behavior of the function. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and performs its internal operations without returning any output.**
