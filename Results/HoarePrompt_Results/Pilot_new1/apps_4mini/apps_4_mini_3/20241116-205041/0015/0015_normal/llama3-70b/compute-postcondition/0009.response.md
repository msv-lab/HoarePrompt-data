The code prints 'YES', indicating a positive outcome based on the conditions given in the initial state. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change, but the print statement outputs a message. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`, and the result of `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, and the output is 'YES'.
