The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is equal to 0; and 'NO' is printed.**
