Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is equal to `b`; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This includes the edge case where `b` is less than `a` and `c` is positive, resulting in 'NO', and the case where `b` is greater than `a` and `c` is negative, also resulting in 'NO'.***
