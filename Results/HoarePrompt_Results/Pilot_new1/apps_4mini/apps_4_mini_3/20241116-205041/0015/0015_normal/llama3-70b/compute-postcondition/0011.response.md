The code prints 'NO' to the output. It does not modify the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The output state also indicates that 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `c` is not equal to 0, either `(b - a) % c != 0` or `(b - a) / c < 0, and 'NO' has been printed**
