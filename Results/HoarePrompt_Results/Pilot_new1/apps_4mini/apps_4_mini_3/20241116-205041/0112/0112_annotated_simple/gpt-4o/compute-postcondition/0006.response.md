The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`. The previous value of `used_cubes[i]` was `False`, indicating that the cube at index `i` was not previously used. The other variables `n`, `digits`, `digit`, `found`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `used_cubes[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]**
