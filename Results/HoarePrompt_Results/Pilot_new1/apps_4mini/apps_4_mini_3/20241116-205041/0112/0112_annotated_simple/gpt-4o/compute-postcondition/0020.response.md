According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is 3. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 3 at the start of the next iteration. There are no other states that need to be adjusted, as `n` remains 3 and the other variables do not change their conditions.

State: **`n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `i` is 3**
