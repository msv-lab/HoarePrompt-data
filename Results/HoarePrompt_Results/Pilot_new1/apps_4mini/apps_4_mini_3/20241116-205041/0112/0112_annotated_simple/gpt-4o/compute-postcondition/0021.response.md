Output State: **`found` is True if at least one `used_cubes[i]` was initially False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]` for some `i` in the range of `n`. If no such `i` exists or if all `used_cubes[i]` were initially True or `digit` was not in any of the corresponding `cube_faces[i]`, then `found` remains False. The state of `used_cubes` is updated to True for the first `i` where the conditions are met; otherwise, it remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False.**
