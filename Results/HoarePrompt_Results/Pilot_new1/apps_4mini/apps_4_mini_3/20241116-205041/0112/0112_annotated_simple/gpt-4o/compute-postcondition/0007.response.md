The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`, so now it changes to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]**
