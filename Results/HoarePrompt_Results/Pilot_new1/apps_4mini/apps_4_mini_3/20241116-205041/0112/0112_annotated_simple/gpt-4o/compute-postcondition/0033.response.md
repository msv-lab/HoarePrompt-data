Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if it can be formed using a list of available cube faces (`cube_faces`). It returns True if each digit of `num` can be matched with a corresponding cube face, ensuring that each cube can only be used once. If any digit cannot be matched, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `cube_faces` is empty or if the input number has digits that cannot be matched with the available cube faces, leading to a False return. Additionally, if `num` is 0, it will still attempt to match the digit '0' with the available cube faces. **
