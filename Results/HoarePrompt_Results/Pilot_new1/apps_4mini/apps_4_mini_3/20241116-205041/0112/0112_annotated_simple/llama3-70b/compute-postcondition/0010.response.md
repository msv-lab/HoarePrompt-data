Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of all unique digits found in the lists within `cubes`. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, the loop executes for each list in `cubes`, updating `digits` accordingly.**
