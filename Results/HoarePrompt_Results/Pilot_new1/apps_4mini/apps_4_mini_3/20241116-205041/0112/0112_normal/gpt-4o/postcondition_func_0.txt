The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` lists called `cubes`, each containing 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). It returns the largest integer `x` such that the function `can_form_number(x)` returns true, or 0 if `can_form_number(1)` is false. If `can_form_number(1)` is false initially, the function will not enter the loop and will directly return 0. There are no checks for invalid inputs for `n` or the contents of `cubes`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the inputs do not meet the specified conditions.
