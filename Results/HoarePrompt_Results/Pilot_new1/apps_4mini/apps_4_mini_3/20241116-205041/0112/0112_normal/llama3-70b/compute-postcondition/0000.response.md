The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Therefore, after execution, `n` will hold the value of the input integer, which must be either 1, 2, or 3. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
