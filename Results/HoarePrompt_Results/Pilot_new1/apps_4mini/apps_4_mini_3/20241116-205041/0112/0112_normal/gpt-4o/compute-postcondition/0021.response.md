Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element; `digit` is the first element in `digits`. If there exists an index `i` such that `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop exits. If no such index exists, `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` remains False. If `n` is 0 or if all elements in `used_cubes` are True or if `digit` is not present in any of the `cube_faces`, the loop does not execute and `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` remains False.**
