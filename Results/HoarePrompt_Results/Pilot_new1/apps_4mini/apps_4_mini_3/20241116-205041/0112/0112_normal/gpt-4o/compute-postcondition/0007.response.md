The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous state of `found` was `False`, so now it is updated to `True`. The other variables (`n`, `digits`, `digit`, `used_cubes`, `i`, and `cube_faces`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `found`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to True, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]**
