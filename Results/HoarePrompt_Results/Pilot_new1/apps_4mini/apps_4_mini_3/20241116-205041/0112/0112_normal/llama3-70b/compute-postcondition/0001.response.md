The variable `cubes` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the `int` function over the input values taken from `input().split()`. The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 3. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cubes` will be a list containing `n` lists of integers, each corresponding to a line of input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers from input**
