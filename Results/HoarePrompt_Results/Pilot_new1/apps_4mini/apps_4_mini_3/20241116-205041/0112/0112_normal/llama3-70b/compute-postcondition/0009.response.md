According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will execute for each `cube` in `cubes`, and since `n` is 3, this means there are 3 lists in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, which indicates that the loop has iterated through all 3 lists. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 4 lists. Additionally, since the loop variable `cube` will represent the next list, it should be the fourth list in the `cubes`. 

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `n` should be updated to reflect that there are at least 4 lists in `cubes`.
- `cube` should be updated to represent the fourth list in `cubes`.
- `digits` should be updated to contain string representations of the integers in the fourth `cube`.

State: **`n` is at least 4; `cubes` is a list of at least 4 lists of integers; `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
