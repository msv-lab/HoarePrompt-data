The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, but since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, we can assume that `num` is also an integer that could be derived from `n`. However, without a specific value for `num`, we cannot determine the exact content of `digits`. The `digits` variable will contain a list of string representations of the digits of `num`. 

Therefore, the output state is based on the assumption that `num` is some integer value. Since we do not have a specific value for `num`, we can only note that `digits` will be a list of characters representing the digits of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits of `num`**
