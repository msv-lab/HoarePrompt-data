The code initializes `used_cubes` as a list of boolean values, all set to `False`. The length of this list is determined by the value of `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 3. Therefore, `used_cubes` will have a length equal to `n`, with every element initialized to `False`. The values of `n` and `digits` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to False**
