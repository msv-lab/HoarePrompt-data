Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing string representations of integers found in the lists of `cubes`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. If `n` is 0, `digits` remains an empty set. If `n` is between 1 and 3, `digits` contains unique string representations of integers from the lists of `cubes`, excluding '0' if it was present.***
