Postcondition: ***If `found` is False, the function returns False, indicating that either no unused cubes were found with the specified `digit`, or the conditions for executing the loop were not met (i.e., `n` is 0, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, or `digit` is not present in any of the `cube_faces`). If `found` is True, the state of `used_cubes` and `found` is unchanged, and the function does not return anything.***
