According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will execute for each list in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3, meaning `cubes` has at least 2 lists. Since `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more list in `cubes`. This means `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 3, and `cube` should be the third list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is 3; `cubes` is a list of 3 lists of integers; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
