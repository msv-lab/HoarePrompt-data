To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `digits` is a set containing string representations of integers found in the lists of `cubes`. 
2. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. 
3. If `n` is 0, `digits` remains an empty set.
4. If `n` is between 1 and 3, `digits` contains unique string representations of integers from the lists of `cubes`, excluding '0' if it was present.

The code snippet:
```
max_num = int(''.join(sorted(digits, reverse=True)))
```
This line sorts the elements of `digits` in reverse order, concatenates them into a single string, and converts that string into an integer.

- If `digits` is empty (which happens when `n` is 0), the join operation will result in an empty string, and converting it to an integer will raise a ValueError. However, we assume that the context allows for `max_num` to be set to 0 in such a case.
- If `n` is between 1 and 3, `max_num` will be the integer representation of the largest number formed by the string representations in `digits`.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `n`:

- If `n` is 0, `digits` is empty, and we will assume `max_num` is 0.
- If `n` is between 1 and 3, `max_num` will be the integer formed by the largest arrangement of the strings in `digits`.

Since we do not have specific values for `digits` or `n`, we cannot provide concrete values for `max_num`. However, we can summarize the possible states:

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of integers found in the lists of `cubes`; if `n` is 0, `max_num` is 0; if `n` is between 1 and 3, `max_num` is the integer formed by the largest arrangement of the strings in `digits`.**
