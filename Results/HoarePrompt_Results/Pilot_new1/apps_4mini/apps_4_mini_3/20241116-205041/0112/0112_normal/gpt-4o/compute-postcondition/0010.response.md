According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the loop can execute while `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be equal to `n` for the loop to terminate, since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be equal to `n`, which means we need to ensure that `n` is increased by 1. However, since `n` can only be 1, 2, or 3, and it must remain within that range, it cannot be increased. 

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to indicate that `i` must be adjusted to be less than `n`. Since `i` is already at `n`, we need to reflect that the loop has completed its iterations and cannot execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, `found` is set to True, and `i` is equal to `n`.**
