The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. The previous values of `n` and `cubes` are not affected by this operation, as the set is simply being created. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `cubes`, along with the new state of `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers from input; `digits` is an empty set**
