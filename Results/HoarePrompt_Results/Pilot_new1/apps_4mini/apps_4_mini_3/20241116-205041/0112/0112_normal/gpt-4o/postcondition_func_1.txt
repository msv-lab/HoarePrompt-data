The function accepts an integer `num`, which it converts into its constituent digits, and checks if each digit can be matched with available cube faces (represented by a list of lists called `cube_faces`). It returns True if all digits can be matched successfully to distinct cube faces; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `n` is defined or where `cube_faces` is provided, which may lead to errors if they are not properly initialized. Additionally, if `num` is 0 or if there are no digits to match, the function still processes but does not return a specific message for these cases.
