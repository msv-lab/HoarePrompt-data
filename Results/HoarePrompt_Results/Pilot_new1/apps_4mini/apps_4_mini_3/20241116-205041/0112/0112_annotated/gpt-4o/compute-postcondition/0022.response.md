Postcondition: ***`used_cubes` contains boolean values indicating which cube faces have been used based on the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces`. `found` is False, indicating that `digit` was not found in any of the cube faces up to `n`. If `n` is 1, 2, or 3, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged with all values as False. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 3, this situation is not expected based on the precondition.***
