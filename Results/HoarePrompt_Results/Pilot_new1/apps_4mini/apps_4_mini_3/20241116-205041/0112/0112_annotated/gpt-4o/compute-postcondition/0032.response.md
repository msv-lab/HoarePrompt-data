The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 3. Additionally, it operates on a list of lists called `cube_faces`, where each `cube_faces[i]` is a list of 6 integers, and each integer `a_{i}_{j}` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_{i}_{j}` ≤ 9. 

After executing the function body, there are two possible outcomes:
- Case 1: If all `digits` are found in `cube_faces`, the function returns `True`. If any `digit` is not found, the function returns `False`.
- Case 2: If `digits` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains a list of `n` False values, but the handling of this case is not explicitly stated in the output.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and a list of lists `cube_faces`, and determine if all specified `digits` can be formed using the cube faces, returning `True` if they can be formed and `False` if they cannot. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num (an integer where 1 ≤ num ≤ 3) and a list of lists cube_faces (each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9). It returns True if all digits can be formed from the cube faces; otherwise, it returns False.**
