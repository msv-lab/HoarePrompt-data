According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will execute for each list in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 lists, and `cube` is the second list in `cubes`. For the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least 3 lists in `cubes`, and `cube` must be updated to the third list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 3 lists; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of digits from `cube`.**
