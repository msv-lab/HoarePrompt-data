The code executes the `print(max_num)` statement, which outputs the value of `max_num`. The initial state indicates that `max_num` is an integer formed by joining the sorted `digits` in descending order. Since the code only prints `max_num` and does not alter any variable states, the output state remains unchanged for other variables.

Output State: **`cubes` is a list with at least one list; `digits` contains string representations of digits from all lists in `cubes`, with '0' removed if present; `max_num` is the integer formed by joining the sorted `digits` in descending order, and the function prints `max_num`.**
