According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If `digits` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is set to False, and `digits` has at least one more element. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `digit` should be the next element in the `digits` list.

Since `found` is already set to False, it does not need any adjustment. The only adjustments needed are to ensure that `digits` has at least one more element and to set `digit` to the next element in the list.

State: **`used_cubes` contains boolean values indicating which cube faces have been used based on the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces`, `found` is False, `digits` has at least one more element, `digit` is the next element in `digits`**
