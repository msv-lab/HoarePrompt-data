According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains at least one 'a' and at least one 'b', and `char` is 'a'. Since `s` contains 'a', the loop can execute again. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`s` contains at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'aa'; `char` is 'a'**
