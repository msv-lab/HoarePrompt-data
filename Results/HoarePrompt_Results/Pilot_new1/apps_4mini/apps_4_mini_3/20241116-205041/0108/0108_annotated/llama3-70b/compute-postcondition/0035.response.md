Output State: **`if char is in s then res` contains all occurrences of `char` in `s`, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII order until `char` is no longer in `s`. If `char` is not in `s` at the start, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged while `s` also remains unchanged.`**
