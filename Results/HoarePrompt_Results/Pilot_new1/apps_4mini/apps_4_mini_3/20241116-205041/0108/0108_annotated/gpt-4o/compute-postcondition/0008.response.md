According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop will execute again if both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `len(s)` must be greater than 1. The variable `j` is either 0 or 1, and since `target_len` is 26, `j` must be less than 26 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `len(s)` is greater than 1 if it is currently equal to or less than 1, and `j` must be less than 26.

State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is less than 26**
