The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `char`. However, the initial value of `res` is not provided, so we cannot determine its new value. The state of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `res` is increased by `char`.

Output State: **`s` contains `char`, and `res` is increased by `char`**
