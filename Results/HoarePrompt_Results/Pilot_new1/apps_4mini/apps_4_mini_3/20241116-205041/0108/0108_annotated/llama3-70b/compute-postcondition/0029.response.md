The value of `res` is incremented by the value of `char`. Since `res` remains unchanged prior to this operation, we know that `char` is being added to `res`. The state of the other variable `s` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one occurrence of the original `char`, and `res` is updated to include `char`.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of the original `char`, and `res` is updated to include `char`**
