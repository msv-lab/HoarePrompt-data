The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to the character at index `j` of `target`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to the character at index `j` of `target`**.
