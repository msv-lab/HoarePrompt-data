Output State: **`if char is in s then res` contains all occurrences of `char` from `s`, followed by occurrences of the next characters in ASCII order that were originally in `s`. At the end, `s` will have all instances of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII, and `char` will no longer be in `s`. If `char` is not in `s` at the start, the loop won't execute and `res` will be empty, while `s` remains unchanged.`**
