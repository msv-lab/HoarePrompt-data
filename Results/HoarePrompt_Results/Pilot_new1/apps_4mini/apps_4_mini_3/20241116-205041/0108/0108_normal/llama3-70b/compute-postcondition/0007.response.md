The code `res += char` appends the value of `char`, which is 'b', to the string `res`, which currently is 'a'. Therefore, after execution, `res` will be 'ab'. The variables `s`, `alphabet`, and `char` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is the modified string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b'; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'ab'; `char` is 'b'**
