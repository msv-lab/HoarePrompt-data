Output State: **`if s contains at least one occurrence of 'a' to 'z', then res will be a string containing those characters in the order they were found in s, and s will have those characters replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If s does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop will not execute, and res will remain an empty string while s remains unchanged.`**
