The loop iterates through the string `s` and checks if the characters match the characters in the `target` string, which consists of all lowercase English letters in order. The loop continues until either the end of the string `s` is reached or all characters in `target` have been matched.

If `s` contains all letters from `a` to `z` in order, the loop will execute until `i` reaches the length of `s` and `j` will equal `target_len` (26). If `s` does not contain all the letters or is missing some, `j` will stop incrementing when it reaches the last matching character in `target`, and `i` will continue until it reaches the end of `s`.

Output State: **`if s contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order then j is 26 and i is equal to the length of s. if s does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z', then i is less than the length of s and j is less than 26.`**
