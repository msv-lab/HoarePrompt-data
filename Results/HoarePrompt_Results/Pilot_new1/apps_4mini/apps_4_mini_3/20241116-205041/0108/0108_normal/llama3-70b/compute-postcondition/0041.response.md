The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. The variables `res` and `s` remain unchanged, with `res` still being an empty string and not containing all characters from 'a' to 'z'. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is an empty string, `s` remains unchanged, and `res` does not contain all characters from 'a' to 'z'.

Output State: **`res` is an empty string, `s` remains unchanged, and `res` does not contain all characters from 'a' to 'z'**
