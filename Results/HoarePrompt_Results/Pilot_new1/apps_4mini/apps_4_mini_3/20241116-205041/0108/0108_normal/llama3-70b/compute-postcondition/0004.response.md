The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char`, which is 'a'. Since `res` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `res` will contain 'a'. The other variables `s`, `alphabet`, and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', and `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
