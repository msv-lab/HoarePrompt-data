The code snippet replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. The variable `res` remains unchanged, but the state of `s` will be affected. The next character to be processed is 'd', which indicates that `char` is likely 'c' because the code is designed to replace `char` with the next character.

Thus, after executing the code:

1. If `char` is 'c', `s` will have 'c' replaced with 'd'.
2. If `char` is anything else, the corresponding character will be replaced with its next ASCII character.

Since we don't have the exact value of `s` or `char`, we can only describe the change generally.

Output State: **`res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `char`; `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next ASCII character**.
