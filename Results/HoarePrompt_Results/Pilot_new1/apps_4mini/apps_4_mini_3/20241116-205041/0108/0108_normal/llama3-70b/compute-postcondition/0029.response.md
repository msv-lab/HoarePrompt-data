The code snippet `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the string `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `next_char`, and `s` contains `chr(ord(char) + 1)` present. The variable `char` is part of the characters found in `s`.

After executing the code, `res` will now include the additional character `char`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res`.

Output State: **`res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `next_char` and `char`**
