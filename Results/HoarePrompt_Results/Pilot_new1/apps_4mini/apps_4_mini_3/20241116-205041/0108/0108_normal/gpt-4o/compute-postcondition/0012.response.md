To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` statement: `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`.

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, which means `len(s)` is at least 2.
   - `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and thus `target_len` is 26.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `j` is less than or equal to 26.

2. **Evaluating the Conditions**:
   - The first condition, `i < len(s)`, needs to hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is 2 and `len(s)` is at least 2, we have:
     - If `len(s)` is exactly 2, then `i` is not less than `len(s)`, so the loop cannot execute again.
     - If `len(s)` is greater than 2, then `i` is less than `len(s)`, and the loop can execute again.
   - The second condition, `j < target_len`, must also hold true. Since `j` is currently less than or equal to 26, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 26.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 2 (to satisfy `i < len(s)`) and that `j` is less than 26.
   - We do not need to adjust `i` since it is already 2. We need to adjust `j` to be less than 26.

Based on this analysis, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is less than 26**
