According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in Unicode. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be present in `s`. Since `s` has been modified and `char` has been replaced, we need to ensure that `char` is still in `s`. This means that `char` must be adjusted to the next character in Unicode that is still present in `s`.

Hence, we need to adjust `char` to ensure it is still in `s` after the modification. 

State: **`res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in Unicode, and `char` is the character that is still present in `s` after the modification.**
