The function does not accept any parameters and processes an input string `s`, which consists of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string `res` that contains each character from 'a' to 'z' based on their occurrences in `s`, replacing each character with the next character in the ASCII sequence until no more occurrences are found. If `res` contains exactly 26 characters (which means all letters from 'a' to 'z' were present in `s`), it prints `res`. If not, it prints -1. The function does not handle cases where `s` has characters outside the range of 'a' to 'z', nor does it account for strings that contain only 'z', which would lead to an empty `res`.
