The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that follows it in the ASCII table. The value of `s` still contains `char`, meaning it has at least one occurrence of `char`. The `res` variable is not directly affected by this operation, but it is based on the number of occurrences of `char` in the original `s`. After the replacement, `s` will no longer contain the first occurrence of `char`, but `res` will still hold the same value as it is based on the original string.

Therefore, the output state is: `res` is 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s`, and `s` no longer contains the first occurrence of `char`.

Output State: **`res` is 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s`, and `s` no longer contains the first occurrence of `char`**
