Output State: **`if 'a' is present in the string s then res is the string 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in s, and s will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b'. If 'a' is not present in s, the loop will not execute, and res will remain an empty string, with s unchanged. If the last character in res reaches 'z', the loop will stop as 'z' will not be in s anymore and the final value of char will be 'z'.`**
