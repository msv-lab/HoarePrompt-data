The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The values of the variables `s`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the original values of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is equal to len(s), `j` is less than 26, and the output is -1**
