According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, the current value of `num` is `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to `l + 1`, and the loop will continue as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`.

Given that `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and since `total_sum` is updated based on the result of `func_1(num, k)`, we don't need to adjust `k` or `total_sum` for the next iteration.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state so that `num` is now `l + 1`. 

State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l + 1`**
