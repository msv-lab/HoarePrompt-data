The variable `total_sum` is updated with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is `l + 1`, which is unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 1) % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is (l + 1) % MOD, `num` is l + 1**
