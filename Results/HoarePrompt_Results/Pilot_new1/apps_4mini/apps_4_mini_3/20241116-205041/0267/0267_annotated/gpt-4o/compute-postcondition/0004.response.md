Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is between 1 and 10; `total_sum` is 0 initially, and if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to (0 + `num`) % MOD, where `num` is equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains 0.***
