To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given information.

1. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. This means it will execute for values of `num` starting from `l` up to and including `r`.
2. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `l`, `r`, and `k` are unchanged. However, we do not have specific values for `l` and `r`. 
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. If the last executed value of `num` was `r`, the loop will not execute again since the next value would be `r + 1`, which is outside the specified range.

Since we are not provided with the specific values of `l` and `r`, we can only conclude that:
- If `num` was `r` in the last iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `r` must be adjusted to `r + 1` to allow `num` to take on the new value.

Thus, the adjusted state would reflect that `r` is now greater than the previous value, allowing for one more iteration.

State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is greater than the previous value of `r`, `k` is unchanged**
