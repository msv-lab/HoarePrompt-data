According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `k - 1`. Thus, we need to adjust `i` to `k - 1`. The variable `k` does not need to be adjusted as its value is unchanged. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated based on the expression, `i` is `k - 1`**
