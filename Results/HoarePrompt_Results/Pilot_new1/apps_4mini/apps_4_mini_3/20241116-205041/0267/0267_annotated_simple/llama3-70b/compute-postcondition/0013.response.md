The expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` updates the value of `dp[n, k]`. 

Given that `dp[n, k]` currently has a value of `9 * 10`, we can analyze the impact of the code on the state:

1. The term `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)` will depend on the value of `i`, which is not provided in the initial state.
2. The term `(10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` also depends on the values of `k` and `i`.
3. Since `k` is at least 3, and `n` is at least `10 ** k`, `10 ** (k - i)` and `10 ** (i - 1)` will yield large values based on the specific values of `i` and `k`.

However, without specific values for `i` and `k`, we cannot compute a precise numerical result for `dp[n, k]`. The output state will reflect that `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` to its current value of `9 * 10`**.
