The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to its current value and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `total_sum` is 0. However, the values of `num` and `MOD` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `total_sum`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated based on the addition of `num` and modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated based on the addition of `num` and modulo `MOD`.**
