According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Since `l` and `r` are guaranteed to satisfy the condition `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, the loop can execute as is. 

At the start of the loop, `num` should be initialized to `l`, which is the first value in the range. The `total_sum` is initialized to 0, but that does not affect the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `num` starts at `l`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
