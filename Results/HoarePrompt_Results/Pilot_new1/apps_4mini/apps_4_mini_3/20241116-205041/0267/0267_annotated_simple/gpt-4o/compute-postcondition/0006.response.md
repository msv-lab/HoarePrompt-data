The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `total_sum` is 0, so the new value will depend on the value of `num` and `MOD`. Since `num` and `MOD` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `total_sum`. However, we know that `total_sum` will be updated from 0 to `(0 + num) % MOD`, which simplifies to `num % MOD`. The other variables `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `num % MOD`**
