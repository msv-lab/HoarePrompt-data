According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`, which means it will include `r` as the last value if `r` is included in the range. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r\), `r` is at least 1, and it has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `num` must be equal to `r + 1`, which is the next integer after `r`. 

Since `r` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `r` should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can run again. The range would need to be updated to reflect that `r` is now `r + 1` (which was initially just `r` before the increment).

Thus, to allow for one more iteration, we need to adjust `r` to be at least equal to `l`, and since `l` is already less than or equal to the new `r`, we can keep `l` the same.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0.**
