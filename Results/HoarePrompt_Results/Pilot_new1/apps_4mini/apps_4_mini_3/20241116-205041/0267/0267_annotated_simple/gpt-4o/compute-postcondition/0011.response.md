According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will iterate over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. Since `l` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r` and `r` is at least 2, we need to determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `l` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r`
- `r` is at least 2
- `total_sum` is 0, but this does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be less than or equal to `r`. If `num` was equal to `r` in the last iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `r` must be incremented or `l` must be adjusted to allow for additional iterations. 

Since `num` iterates from `l` to `r`, if the last value of `num` was `r`, then in the next iteration, `num` would be `r + 1`, which is outside the range. Therefore, we need to ensure that `r` is adjusted to allow for one more execution. 

Thus, we can conclude:
- `r` needs to be adjusted to `r + 1` to allow for the next iteration.
- The value of `l` remains unchanged since it is already within the valid range.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0.**
