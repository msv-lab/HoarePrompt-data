The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. The output state reflects the increment in `sequence[i]` while keeping the other variables as previously defined. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
