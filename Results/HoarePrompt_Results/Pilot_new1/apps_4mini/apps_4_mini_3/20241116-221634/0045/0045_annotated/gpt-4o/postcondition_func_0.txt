The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` consecutive positive integers. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, the function returns -1. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, it computes a sequence of `k` integers where the sum of the integers is as close as possible to `n`. The function returns this sequence. If the remainder after dividing `n` by the minimum sum is initially zero, the sequence remains unchanged.
