Output State: **`sequence` contains the initial values incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `remainder` is reduced by the same number of times the loop executed, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`. If `remainder` is initially 0, the loop does not execute, and `sequence` remains unchanged while `remainder` is equal to its initial value.**
