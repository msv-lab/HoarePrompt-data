Output State: **`if b is greater than 0 then a will be the original value of b and b will be the remainder of a divided by b, which is a positive integer less than the original value of b. The loop will continue until b becomes 0, at which point a will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of n and k. If b is initially 0, the loop will not execute and a will remain as the initial value of b, which is irrelevant since b must be a positive integer.`**
