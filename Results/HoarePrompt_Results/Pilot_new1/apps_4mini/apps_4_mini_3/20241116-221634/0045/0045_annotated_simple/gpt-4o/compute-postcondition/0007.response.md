According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `k`. The loop is set to iterate from `k - 1` down to `0`, which means that `k` must be at least `1` for the loop to have any iterations. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, we can conclude that the loop will execute if `k` is at least `1`. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to `k - 1`, which will be the last index of the `sequence` list. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to `1`, and `i` should be initialized to `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements calculated as [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)], `i` is `k - 1`**
