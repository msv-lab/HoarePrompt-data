The value of `sequence[i]` is increased by 1. The previous value of `i` is `k - 1`, and the state of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`) is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `sequence[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.**
