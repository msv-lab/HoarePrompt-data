The code snippet performs a tuple assignment where `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The initial state indicates that `a` has a value derived from `b`, and since `b` is not equal to 0, the modulo operation will yield a valid result.

Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers, the new value of `b` will be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which will also be a positive integer or zero, but since `b` is not zero after the operation, it will remain positive.

The output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` after the operation, where `a` takes the previous value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`.

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the value of `a % b` (which is positive and not equal to 0)**
