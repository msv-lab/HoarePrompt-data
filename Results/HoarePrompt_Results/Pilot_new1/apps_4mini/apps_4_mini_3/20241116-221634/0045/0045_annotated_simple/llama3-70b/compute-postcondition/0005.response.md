According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue executing as long as `b` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the result of `a % b`, and since `b` is the previous value of `b` (which is positive and not equal to 0), it means that `b` is currently not zero. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must remain non-zero.

Since `b` is already positive and not equal to 0 at the end of the last iteration, no adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is `a % b`**
