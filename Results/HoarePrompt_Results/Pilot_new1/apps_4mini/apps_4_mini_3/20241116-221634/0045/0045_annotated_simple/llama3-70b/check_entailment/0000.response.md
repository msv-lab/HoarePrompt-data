Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem requires generating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD). 

The code snippet provided only defines a function `func_1` that computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it does not address the problem of generating the sequence of integers based on the input values `n` and `k`. 

For example, if we input `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the expected output is `-1`, as it is impossible to create a strictly increasing sequence of 3 positive integers that sums to 5. The code does not have any logic to handle this case or any other cases related to the creation of the sequence.

Since the code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and does not handle various potential cases, it is deemed incorrect.
