The variable `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, which is the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`. The previous values of `n` and `min_sum` are not affected by this operation. Since `min_sum` was calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, it is guaranteed to be a positive integer as both `k` is a positive integer and the formula results in a positive integer. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `d` based on the integer division.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`**
