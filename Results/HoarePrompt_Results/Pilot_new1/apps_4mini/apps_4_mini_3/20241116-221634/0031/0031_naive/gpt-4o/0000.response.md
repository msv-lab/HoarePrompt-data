To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the probability that at least two out of `k` people share a birthday when there are `2^n` days in a year. The output should be an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime and the results are printed modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Program Analysis
1. **GCD Function**: The function `func_1(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is necessary for reducing the fraction.

2. **Main Function**: 
   - The function `func_2(n, k)` checks if `k` exceeds `2^n`. If it does, it prints `1 1`, which indicates that there is a 100% probability of at least two people sharing a birthday.
   - It calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 1 << n` (which is \( 2^n \)).
   - It uses a loop to calculate the numerator and denominator for the probability of no shared birthdays.
   - It computes the probability of shared birthdays as `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.
   - Finally, it reduces the fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) and prints the result modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. **When `k` is very large**: For instance, if `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the program correctly identifies that two people must share a birthday, hence it outputs `1 1`. This is handled correctly.

2. **When `n` is very large and `k` is small**: For example, with `n = 60` and `k = 2`, the program should compute the probability correctly as \( \frac{1}{2^{60}} \). 

3. **Modulo Operations**: The program uses modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \) for both `A` and `B`. However, if `k` is small compared to `2^n`, the resulting values of `A` and `B` may not be handled properly if they exceed the modulo value before reduction.

4. **Numerical Stability**: The loop calculating the numerator and denominator could lead to overflow issues if not handled properly, especially since `n` and `k` can be as large as \( 10^{18} \).

5. **Reduction of A and B**: The program reduces `A` and `B` after computing them, but we need to ensure that the reduction is performed correctly after taking modulo.

### Conclusion
While the program seems to handle many cases correctly, the potential for overflow and incorrect handling of the modulo operation raises concerns. Specifically, when `k` is large relative to `2^n`, the calculations may not yield the expected irreducible fraction due to the modulo operation applied before reduction.

Thus, I can identify a case where the program may not work as expected:

- If `n = 60` and `k = 3`, the calculation of `A` and `B` may not yield the correct irreducible fraction before modulo is applied, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **False**.
