The value of `numerator` is divided by `gcd`, which is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. This operation reduces `numerator` by the factor of `gcd`. The values of `denominator`, `total_days`, and `gcd` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is equal to the product of (2^n - i) for i in range(k) divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is equal to 2^(k * n), `total_days` is 2^n, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.

Output State: **`numerator` is equal to the product of (2^n - i) for i in range(k) divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is equal to 2^(k * n), `total_days` is 2^n, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`**
