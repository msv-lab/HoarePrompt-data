The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. After executing the function body, it returns the result of the expression `numerator % (10)`, where `numerator` is presumably calculated based on the input parameters `n` and `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the result of the modulus operation involving `numerator` and `10`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, and returns the result of `numerator % (10)`, where `numerator` is derived from `n` and `k`.**
