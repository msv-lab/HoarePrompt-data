The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is initially 0, the function returns the unchanged value of `a`. If `b` is greater than 0, the function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`. The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are negative, which could lead to unexpected results in terms of GCD calculation.
