The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with `n` constrained to the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `k` constrained to the range 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. If this condition is not met, there are no actions taken, and the function does not print or return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` exceeds 2 raised to the power of `n`, it prints (1, 1) and returns; otherwise, it performs no actions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`. If `k` is not greater, the function does not print or return any value.**
