The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. Given that `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, the new value of `denominator` becomes `denominator * total_days`, which is `2^(2n) * 2^n = 2^(2n + n) = 2^(3n)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is updated to (2^n * (2^n - 1)) * (2^n - 2), `denominator` is 2^(3n), `i` is 2**
