The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The value of `total_days` is \(2^n\), which is not specified but is a power of 2 based on `n`. The previous values of `denominator` are not provided, but it is affected by the multiplication. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `denominator` based on the multiplication with `total_days`.

Output State: **`total_days` is \(2^n\); `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^n) % MOD`**
