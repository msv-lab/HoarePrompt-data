The value of `total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2^n`. This means that `total_days` will hold the value of `2` raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `total_days` will be a large integer that represents `2^n`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and there is no return statement executed in this context.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, and `total_days` is 2^n**
