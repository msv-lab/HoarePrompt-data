The variable `B` is updated by floor dividing its previous value by `g`, which is the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`. The previous value of `B` is `p_total`, and since `g` is derived from the function `func_1(A, B)`, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the output of that function. However, we can express the new value of `B` as `B = p_total // g`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is updated by floor dividing its previous value by `g`, `p_no_shared` is `numerator`, `p_total` is `denominator`, `B` is updated to `p_total // g`, `g` is the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`**
