The variable `denominator` is assigned the value of `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\), and `numerator` is `1`. The assignment does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
