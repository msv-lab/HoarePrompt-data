The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `A` is `p_shared`, `p_no_shared` is `numerator`, `p_total` is `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The assignment does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `A` is `p_shared`, `p_no_shared` is `numerator`, `p_total` is `denominator`, `B` is `p_total`.

Output State: **`A` is `p_shared`, `p_no_shared` is `numerator`, `p_total` is `denominator`, `B` is `p_total`**
