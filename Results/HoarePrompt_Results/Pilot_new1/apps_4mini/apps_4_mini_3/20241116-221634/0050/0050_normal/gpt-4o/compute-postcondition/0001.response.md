The code assigns the value of `s` to a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into parts. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unchanged, and `s` now holds a list of integers based on the input. Since the exact input is not provided, we cannot determine the specific contents of `s`, but we know it will be a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, and `s` is a list of integers from input**
