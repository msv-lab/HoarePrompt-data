The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values (which are space-separated integers) to integers. The initial state does not affect `n`, `m`, `r`, or `s`, but the value of `b` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, and `b` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, and `b` is a list of integers from input**
