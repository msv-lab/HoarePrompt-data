The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is the total number of shares bought, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
