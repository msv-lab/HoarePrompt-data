The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
