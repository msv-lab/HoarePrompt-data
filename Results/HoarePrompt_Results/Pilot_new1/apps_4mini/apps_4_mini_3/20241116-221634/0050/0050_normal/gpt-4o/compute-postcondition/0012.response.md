Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum of the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum of the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, then prints `total_bourles`. This covers the cases where the selling price is not profitable compared to the buying price and where it is, ensuring that all edge cases related to the boundaries of the values are considered.***
