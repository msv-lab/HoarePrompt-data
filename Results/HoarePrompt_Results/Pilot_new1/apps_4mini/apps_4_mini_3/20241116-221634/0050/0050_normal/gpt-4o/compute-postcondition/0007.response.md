Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum of the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum of the list `b`. The maximum sell price is greater than the minimum buy price.***
