Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding `r // s[i]` to its previous value, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
