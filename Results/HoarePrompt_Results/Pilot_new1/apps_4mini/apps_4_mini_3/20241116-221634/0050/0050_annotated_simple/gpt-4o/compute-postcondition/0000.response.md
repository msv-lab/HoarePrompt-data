The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained from the input, where the input consists of three integers separated by spaces. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not known since they are being initialized from the input. Other variables (`s` and `b`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input**
