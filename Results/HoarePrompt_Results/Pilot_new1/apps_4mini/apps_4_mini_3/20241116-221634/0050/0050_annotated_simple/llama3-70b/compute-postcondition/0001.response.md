The variable `s` is assigned a new list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. This means `s` will now contain a list of integers based on the input provided. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unchanged, and `s` takes on the new values from the input. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of integers from input**
