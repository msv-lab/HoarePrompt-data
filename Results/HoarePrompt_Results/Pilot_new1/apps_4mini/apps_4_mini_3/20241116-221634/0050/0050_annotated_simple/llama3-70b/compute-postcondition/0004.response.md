The list `b` is sorted in reverse order. The previous values of `b` are not specified, but the operation will rearrange its elements from highest to lowest. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorting of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order**
