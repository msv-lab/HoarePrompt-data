The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 30.
- `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 1000.
- `s` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `s_i` satisfies 1 <= s_i <= 1000.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 1000.

The functionality of the function `func` is not explicitly defined in the provided output. Therefore, without additional details on the specific return values or conditions based on the input parameters, we cannot determine the exact output behavior of the function. 

However, based on the parameter constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer), m (integer), r (integer), s (list of n integers), and b (list of m integers), where n, m, r, s, and b meet specified constraints. The exact return value is not specified.**
