According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `m` must be greater than 2, and `i` should be incremented to 3. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 3**
