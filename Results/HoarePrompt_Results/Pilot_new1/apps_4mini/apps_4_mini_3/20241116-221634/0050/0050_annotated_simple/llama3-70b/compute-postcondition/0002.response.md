The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`, which takes an input string, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s`, along with the new variable `b` which is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input**
