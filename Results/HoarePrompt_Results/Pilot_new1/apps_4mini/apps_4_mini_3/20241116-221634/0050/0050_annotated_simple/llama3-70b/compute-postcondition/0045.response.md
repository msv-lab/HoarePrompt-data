The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined with empty parentheses. However, based on the constraints provided, we can infer that the function likely utilizes the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` that are expected to be defined in the surrounding scope or passed in some other manner.

Given the output information is not provided, we can only describe the expected types and constraints of the variables. The function's behavior is not defined in the output provided.

Functionality: **The function is expected to work with integers `n` and `m` (both between 1 and 30 inclusive), integer `r` (between 1 and 1000 inclusive), a list `s` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 1000 inclusive), and a list `b` of `m` integers (each between 1 and 1000 inclusive), but the specific output or behavior of the function is not defined.**
