The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by taking input, splitting it into components, and converting each component to an integer. The initial state does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `r`, but the value of `s` will be a list of integers based on the input provided. Since `s` will hold a list of integers, the output state will reflect that `s` is a list of integers derived from the input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, `m` is an integer satisfying 1 <= m <= 30, `r` is an integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000, and `s` is a list of integers from input**
