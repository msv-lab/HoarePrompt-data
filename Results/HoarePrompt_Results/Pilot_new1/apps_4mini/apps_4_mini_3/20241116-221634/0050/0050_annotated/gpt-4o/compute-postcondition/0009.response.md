The value of `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`. The previous values of `r` and `min_buy_price` are needed to calculate this. Since `r` is an integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, which is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 30 (and thus the minimum value must also be a positive integer), the calculation will yield a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, `m` is an integer satisfying 1 <= m <= 30, `r` is an integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, `m` is an integer satisfying 1 <= m <= 30, `r` is an integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.**
