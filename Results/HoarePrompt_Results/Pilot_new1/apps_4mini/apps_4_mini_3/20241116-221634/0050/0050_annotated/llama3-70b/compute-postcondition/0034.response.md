The variable `shares` is explicitly assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `shares` was also `0`, so it remains unchanged. The other variables (`r`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `b`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `i` is 1, `shares` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged**
