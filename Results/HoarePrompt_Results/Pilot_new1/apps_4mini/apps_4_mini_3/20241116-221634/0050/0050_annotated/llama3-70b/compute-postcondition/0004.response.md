The code sorts the list `b` in reverse order, meaning the largest integers will come first. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged, and the sorted order of `b` will be affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is sorted, and `b` is sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is sorted, and `b` is sorted in reverse order.**
