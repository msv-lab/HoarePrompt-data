The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The input will provide a list of integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `b` now holds a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of integers derived from input, and `b` is a list of integers from the input.**
