Postcondition: ***`r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `i` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, and `b` is unchanged. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
