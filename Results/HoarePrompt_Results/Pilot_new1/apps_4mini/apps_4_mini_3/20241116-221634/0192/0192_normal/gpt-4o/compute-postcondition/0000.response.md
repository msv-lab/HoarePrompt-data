The variables `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the input provided, where `map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts those parts into integers. The initial conditions state that `y` is an integer such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are not given. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new values of `x` and `y`, only that they are updated from their previous values.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated based on input values, with the constraint that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
