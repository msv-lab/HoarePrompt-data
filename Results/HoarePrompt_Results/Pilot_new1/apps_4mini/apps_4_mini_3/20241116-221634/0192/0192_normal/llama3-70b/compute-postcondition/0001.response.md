The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given that `x` is an integer greater than `y`, the absolute value is simply `x - y`. The values of `x` and `y` are not specified, but their relationship is clear. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship and the operation performed.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `y`, `y` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and the output is abs(x - y) which is x - y.**
