The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the constraints, `x` and `y` are integers where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. Therefore, the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` will always be a positive integer since `x` is greater than `y`. The specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but the relationship between them ensures that the output will be a positive integer.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers defined by the input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is abs(`x` - `y`)**
