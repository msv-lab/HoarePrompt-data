The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the input, which consists of two integers. The condition states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, meaning that `y` will always be less than `x` and both will be within the specified range. The specific values of `x` and `y` will depend on the user input but will still adhere to the constraints given.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than `y`, `y` is an input integer such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`**
