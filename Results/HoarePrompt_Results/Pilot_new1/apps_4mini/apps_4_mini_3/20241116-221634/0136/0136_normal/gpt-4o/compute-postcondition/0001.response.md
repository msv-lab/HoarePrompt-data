The value of `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` with any leading zeros removed by the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, if `data[0]` contains leading zeros, they will be stripped away. If `data[0]` is "0" or an empty string, `a` will become an empty string. The variable `b` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
