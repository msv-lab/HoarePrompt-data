The function reads two non-negative integers as strings from input, removes any leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if the first number is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either number is empty after removing leading zeros, it is treated as '0'. The function does not return any values but outputs the comparison result directly.
