The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`. The previous value of `a` was an empty string. The value of `b` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is '0', `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed**
