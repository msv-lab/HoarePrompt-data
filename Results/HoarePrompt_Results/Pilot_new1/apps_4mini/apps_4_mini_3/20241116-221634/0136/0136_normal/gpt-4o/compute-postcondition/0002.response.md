The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state indicates that `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and now it will be updated based on the value of `data[1]`. The previous value of `b` is not specified, but it will change according to the leading zeros in `data[1]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `b` while `a` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed; `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed**
