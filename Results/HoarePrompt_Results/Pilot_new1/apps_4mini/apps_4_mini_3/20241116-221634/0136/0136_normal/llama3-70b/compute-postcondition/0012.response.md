Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers as input strings, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the two strings are equal, '<' if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and '>' if the first string is greater. The function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result. **
