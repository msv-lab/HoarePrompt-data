Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string representations of numbers with leading zeros removed, and if either is empty, it is set to '0'. The lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, and `b` is a non-empty string. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, the output is '>'; otherwise, if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All cases are handled, ensuring that comparisons are valid and the output reflects the relationship between `a` and `b`.***
