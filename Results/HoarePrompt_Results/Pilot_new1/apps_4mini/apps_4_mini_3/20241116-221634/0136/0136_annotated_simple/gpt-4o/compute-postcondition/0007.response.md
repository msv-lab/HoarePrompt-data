The value of `b` is assigned the string `'0'`. The previous value of `b` was an empty string, and `a` remains unchanged as the assignment only affects `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes (which can be '0' if it was an empty string), and `b` is '0'.

Output State: **`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, which can be '0' if it was an empty string; `b` is '0'**
