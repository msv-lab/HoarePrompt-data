The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`, which means it is no longer an empty value (equivalent to false) but now holds the string representation of the number zero. The variable `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is '0', `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes**
