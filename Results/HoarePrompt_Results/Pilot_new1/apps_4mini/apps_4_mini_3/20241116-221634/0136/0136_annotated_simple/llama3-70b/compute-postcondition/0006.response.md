The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '<'. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the original values of `a` and `b`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes, `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes; `a` is not equal to `b`, and the value of `a` is less than the value of `b`; and the output is '<'**
