Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers without leading zeroes. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. All cases are handled, as `a` cannot be equal to `b` at the same time due to the structure of the if-elif-else statement.***
