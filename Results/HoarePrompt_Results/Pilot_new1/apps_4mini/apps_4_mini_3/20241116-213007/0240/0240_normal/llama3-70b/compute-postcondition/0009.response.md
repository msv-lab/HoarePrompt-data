According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 2 characters, and `c` is the second character of `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters, and `c` must be updated to the next character in `s`. Since `c` is currently the second character, it will need to be the third character in the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must have at least 3 characters.
- `c` should be updated to the third character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 3 characters, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, `c` is the third character of `s`**
