The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `t` is a non-empty string of digits that may contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it returns the integer value of `n`, which is the updated value after adding `t` to the previous unknown state of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string of digits `s` and a non-empty string of digits `t`, and return the updated integer value of `n` after adding `t` to it.
