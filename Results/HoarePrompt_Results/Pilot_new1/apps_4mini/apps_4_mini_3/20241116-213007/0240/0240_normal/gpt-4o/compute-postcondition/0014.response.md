Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the current permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string created by joining `perm`. If `chars` contains only one unique digit or if all permutations of `chars` do not yield a valid number with respect to `sub`, the loop may not yield any candidates. If `chars` is empty or does not contain digits, the loop does not execute, and `chars` and `sub` retain their original values.**
