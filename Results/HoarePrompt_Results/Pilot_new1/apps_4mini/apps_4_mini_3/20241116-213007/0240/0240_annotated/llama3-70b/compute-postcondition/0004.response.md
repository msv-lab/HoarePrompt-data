Given the initial state, `n` is an empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s`, which is also an element of `t_set`. 

The code `n += c` concatenates the value of `c` (which is a character) to `n`. Since `n` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `n` will simply become the value of `c`.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is now equal to `c`, and `c` is an element of `t_set`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is now equal to `c`, and `c` is an element of `t_set**
