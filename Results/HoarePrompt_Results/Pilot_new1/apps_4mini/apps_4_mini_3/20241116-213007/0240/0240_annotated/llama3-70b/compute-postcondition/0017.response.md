Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`. It concatenates all characters from `s` that are present in `t` and appends the entire string `t` to this result. Finally, it returns the integer value of the concatenated string. If `s` contains no characters from `t`, the function will return the integer value of `t` alone. If both `s` and `t` are empty or if `s` contains no valid characters, the function will still attempt to convert `t` to an integer and return that.**
