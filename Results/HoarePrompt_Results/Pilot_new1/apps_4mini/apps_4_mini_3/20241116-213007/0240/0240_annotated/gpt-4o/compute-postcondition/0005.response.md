According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of the `chars` string. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements of the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Since `perm` is the first permutation, the next permutation will be the second permutation of `chars`. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence of permutations generated by `permutations(chars)`.

The state of `chars` remains unchanged, and since `candidate` is not valid for the last iteration, we do not need to adjust it. 

Thus, the relevant adjustments are:
- `perm` should be updated to the next permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
