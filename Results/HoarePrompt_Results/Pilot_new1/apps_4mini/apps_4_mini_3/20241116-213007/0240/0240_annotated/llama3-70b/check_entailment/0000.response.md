To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the problem requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Vasya has a large integer `n` which he has written as a string.
2. He appends the number of digits in `n` (denoted as `k`) to the right of `n`.
3. This entire string is shuffled and sent to Kate.
4. Vasya remembers a non-empty substring of `n`, denoted as `t`.
5. The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from the shuffled string and the substring `t`.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1` processes two strings: `s` (the shuffled string) and `t` (the remembered substring).

1. It creates a set `t_set` from `t` which contains the unique characters of `t`.
2. It initializes an empty string `n`.
3. It iterates through each character `c` in `s`, and if `c` is in `t_set`, it appends `c` to `n`.
4. After the loop, it appends the entire string `t` to `n`.
5. Finally, it converts the concatenated string `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Annotations:
- The annotations explain the state of `n` after the loop and the overall behavior of the function.
- They mention that if `s` contains no characters from `t`, the function will return the integer value of `t` alone.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The problem states that `n` should not have leading zeros unless it is "0". The code does not handle the case where the concatenation of characters from `s` might lead to a number with leading zeros when combined with `t`. For example, if `s` is "003512" and `t` is "021", the function would produce "30021", which is valid. However, if `s` were "000012" and `t` were "021", the function would produce "30021" again, which is valid, but if `t` were "0021", the result would be "20021", which is also valid. However, if `t` were "021" and `s` contained no valid characters, it would return `21` which is valid. The leading zero issue could arise if we had a different combination.

2. **Smallest Integer Requirement**: The program does not guarantee that the returned integer `n` is the smallest possible integer that can be formed. The order in which characters from `s` are concatenated may not yield the smallest configuration. For instance, if `s` is "321" and `t` is "1", the function would return "3211", but the smallest integer could be "1231".

### Conclusion:
The program does not ensure that the resulting integer is the smallest possible integer `n` due to how it concatenates characters from `s` and `t`. Additionally, it does not account for leading zeroes in a way that would prevent invalid integers.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
