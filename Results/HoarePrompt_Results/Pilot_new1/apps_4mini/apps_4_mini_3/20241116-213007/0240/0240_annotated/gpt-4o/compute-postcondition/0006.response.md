The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates all characters in the string `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold this permutation as a string. The values of `chars` and `perm` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
