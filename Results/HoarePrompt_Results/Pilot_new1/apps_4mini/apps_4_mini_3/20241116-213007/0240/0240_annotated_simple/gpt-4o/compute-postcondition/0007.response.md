The `yield` statement produces a value and suspends the function's execution, allowing it to be resumed later. The variable `candidate` is yielded, which is equal to `perm`. The values of `chars` and `perm` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and indicates that `candidate` has been yielded.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`**.
