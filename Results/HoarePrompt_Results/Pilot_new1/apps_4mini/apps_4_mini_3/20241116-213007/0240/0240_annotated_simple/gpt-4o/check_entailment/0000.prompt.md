You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s_counter` will have decremented values for each character present in `sub`, with potential negative values if `s` does not contain enough occurrences. If `sub` is non-empty, the loop will execute for each character in `sub_counter`. If `s` is empty or does not contain characters from `sub`, then `s_counter` may contain negative values.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'possible_numbers'

#Function 2:
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if the substring 'sub' is found in the string of digits 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len'; otherwise, it returns False.

#Function 3:
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. The function yields `candidate` if it is a valid number with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If all permutations of `chars` are invalid numbers based on the `is_valid_number` function, no candidates are yielded, and the state remains unchanged.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
