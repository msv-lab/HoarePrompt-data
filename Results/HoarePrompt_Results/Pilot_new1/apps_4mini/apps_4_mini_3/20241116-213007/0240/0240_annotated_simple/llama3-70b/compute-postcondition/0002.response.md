According to the code, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. Since `s` is described as a string containing digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it is necessary to ensure that `s` is not an empty string. 

Additionally, the loop will assign the first character of `s` to `c` during the first iteration. Therefore, we need to set `c` to the first character of `s` if `s` is not empty.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing digits, `c` is the first character of `s`**
