To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements.

The program takes two inputs:
1. A string `s` which is a shuffled version of the concatenated number `n` and the number of digits in `n`.
2. A string `t` which is a non-empty substring of `n`.

The goal is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` such that:
- `n` contains the substring `t`.
- The digits of `n` can be formed from the digits in `s`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
    n += t
    return int(n)

print(func_1(s, t))
```

### Breakdown of the Logic:
1. The function `func_1` creates a set `t_set` from the characters in `t`.
2. It initializes an empty string `n`.
3. It loops through each character `c` in `s` and appends `c` to `n` if `c` is in `t_set`.
4. After the loop, it appends `t` to `n`.
5. Finally, it converts `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The code does not handle leading zeros correctly. If `s` contains leading zeros and they are valid digits for `n`, the resulting integer will not have leading zeros. This could lead to a situation where the smallest `n` is not constructed correctly.
2. **Digit Count**: The program does not ensure that the number of digits in `n` matches the count derived from `s`. It simply collects digits from `s` that are in `t`, which may not yield the smallest valid `n`.
3. **No Constraints on Order**: The program does not consider the order of digits in `s` when constructing `n`. It simply takes any digit from `s` that appears in `t`, which may not result in the smallest possible `n`.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
s = "003512"
t = "021"
```
The expected output should be `30021`. However, the program constructs `n` as follows:
- From `s`, it finds `0`, `0`, `2`, `1` (since `0`, `2`, and `1` are in `t_set`).
- It appends `t` to the collected digits, resulting in `n` being `0021` + `021`, which leads to `0021021`, and converting it to an integer gives `21021`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly reconstruct the smallest integer `n` based on the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, it fails for at least one potential case.

Correctness: **False**
