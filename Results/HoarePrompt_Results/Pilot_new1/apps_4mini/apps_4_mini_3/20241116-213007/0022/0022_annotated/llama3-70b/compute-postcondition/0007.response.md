Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user and `n` is at least 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_palindrome` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome. If the characters match, `is_palindrome` remains True, and the check continues for further characters.***
