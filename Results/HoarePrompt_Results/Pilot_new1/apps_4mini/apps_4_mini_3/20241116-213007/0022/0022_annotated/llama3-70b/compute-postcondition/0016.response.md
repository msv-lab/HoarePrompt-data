According to the code, the loop iterates from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`. The variable `i` represents the current index in this range. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `n` is at least 3, `n // 2` will be at least 1. Therefore, `i` can take on the value `n // 2` in the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`.

No other states need to be adjusted because `n` remains the same, and the string `s` does not need to change for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 3, and `i` is `n // 2`**
