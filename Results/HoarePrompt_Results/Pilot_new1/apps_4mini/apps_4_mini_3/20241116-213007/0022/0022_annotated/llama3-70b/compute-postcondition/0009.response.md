The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, and `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and `is_spalindrome` is set to False.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and `is_spalindrome` is set to False**
