The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `is_spalindrome` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
