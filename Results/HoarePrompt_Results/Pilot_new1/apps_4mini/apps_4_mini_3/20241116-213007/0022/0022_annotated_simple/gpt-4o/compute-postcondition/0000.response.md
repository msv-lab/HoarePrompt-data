The length of the string `s` is calculated using the `len()` function. Since `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is assigned the value of the length of `s`, which is between 1 and 1000. The state of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 (inclusive); `n` is the length of `s`, which is between 1 and 1000.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 (inclusive); `n` is the length of `s`, which is between 1 and 1000**
