The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are `s` (a string of English letters) and `n` (the length of `s`). The assignment does not change the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s`; `is_spalindrome` is True.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s`; `is_spalindrome` is True**
