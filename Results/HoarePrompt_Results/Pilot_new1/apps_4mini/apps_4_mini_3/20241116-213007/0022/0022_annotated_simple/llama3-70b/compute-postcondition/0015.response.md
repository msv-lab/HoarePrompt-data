Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 5, and `is_palindrome` is True. If the character at index `i` (which is 2) does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the loop or statement is exited. If the characters match, `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, and further checks would continue if applicable.***
