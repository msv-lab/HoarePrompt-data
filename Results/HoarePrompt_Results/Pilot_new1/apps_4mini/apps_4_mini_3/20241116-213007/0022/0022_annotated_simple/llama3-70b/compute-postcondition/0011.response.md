Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is exited. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that the string may still be a palindrome, pending further checks.***
