Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input and checks if it is a palindrome. It prints 'TAK' if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not handle cases where the input is empty or contains non-English letters, but it assumes the input will be a valid string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. **
