Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False; otherwise, the function does not return anything, implying that the characters at the specified indices are equal.***
