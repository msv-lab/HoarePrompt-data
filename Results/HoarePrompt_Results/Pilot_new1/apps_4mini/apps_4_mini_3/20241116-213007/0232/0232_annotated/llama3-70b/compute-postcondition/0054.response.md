The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary, which means it will no longer hold any previous counts of colors. The previous state of `window_counts` is now overridden. The variables `found` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is `n - 1**
