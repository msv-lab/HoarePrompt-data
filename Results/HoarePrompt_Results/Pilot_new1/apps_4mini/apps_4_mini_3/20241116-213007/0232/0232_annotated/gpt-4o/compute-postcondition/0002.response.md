The variable `left` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not change the state of any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the initialized variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ sum(`k`) ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, `current_counts` is initialized as a defaultdict of integers with all values set to 0, `left` is 0**.
