Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the key `color`, which is assigned the value of `colors[n]`. If `color` was not already present in `window_counts`, its value is initialized to 0. The variables `found` remains False, and both `i` and `j` retain the value of `n`, where `n` is greater than 0.***
