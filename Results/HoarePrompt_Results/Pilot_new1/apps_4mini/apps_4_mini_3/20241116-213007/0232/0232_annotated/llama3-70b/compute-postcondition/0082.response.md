Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the counts of each unique `color` encountered from index `i` to `n-1` in the `colors` list. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True; otherwise, it remains False. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is undefined. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once, starting with `j` equal to `i`.**
