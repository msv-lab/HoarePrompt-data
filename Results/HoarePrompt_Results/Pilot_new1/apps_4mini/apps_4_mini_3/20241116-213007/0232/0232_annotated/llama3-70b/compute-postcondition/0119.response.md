According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `n` is 1, then the loop has executed once, and for it to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be at least 2. 

Therefore, the relevant states that need to be adjusted are `n` and the current values of `i` and `j`. Since `i` is defined and is currently 0 (the starting index for `range(n)`), it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is defined**
