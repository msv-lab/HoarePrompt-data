The variables `n` and `m` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which means that `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100 and `m` will be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The initial state of `colors` and `counts` remains unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `m` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n**
