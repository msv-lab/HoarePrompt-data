Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `found` is set to True, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1, and the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts` exactly.**
