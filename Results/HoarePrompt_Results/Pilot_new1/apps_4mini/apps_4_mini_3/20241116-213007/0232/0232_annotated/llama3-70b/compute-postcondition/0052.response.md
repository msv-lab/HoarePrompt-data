Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to but not including `n`. If `found` is True, the loop is exited, indicating that the sorted values of `window_counts` matched the values in `counts`. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, `window_counts` remains empty and `found` remains False, and the loop does not execute.***
