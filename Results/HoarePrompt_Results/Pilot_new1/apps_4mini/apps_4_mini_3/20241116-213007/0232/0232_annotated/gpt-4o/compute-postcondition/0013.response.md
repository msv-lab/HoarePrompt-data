Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ sum(`k`) ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, and `current_counts` is modified such that for at least one color, `current_counts[color]` is greater than `desired_counts[color]`. If the counts of all colors in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If they do not match, the function does not return anything.***
