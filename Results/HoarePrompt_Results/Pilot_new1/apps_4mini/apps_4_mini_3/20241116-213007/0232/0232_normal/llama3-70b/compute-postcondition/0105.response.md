Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the key `color`, which is either initialized to `1` or incremented by 1. If the counts in `window_counts` match the target counts, `found` is set to True, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `j` is `n`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[n]`. If the counts do not match, the state remains unchanged.***
