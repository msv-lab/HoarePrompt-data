Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the key `color`, which is either 1 or incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `color_counts`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged, with `i` being `n`, `j` being `n`, and `color` assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
