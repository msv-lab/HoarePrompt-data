Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the key `color`, which is either initialized to `0` if it was not present before, or it remains unchanged. `found` remains False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `j` is `n`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[n]`.***
