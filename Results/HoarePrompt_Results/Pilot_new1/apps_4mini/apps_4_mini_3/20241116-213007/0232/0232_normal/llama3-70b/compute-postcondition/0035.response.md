Postcondition: ***`colors` is non-empty, `color` is the next element of `colors`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `found` is True, and if `color` is not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
