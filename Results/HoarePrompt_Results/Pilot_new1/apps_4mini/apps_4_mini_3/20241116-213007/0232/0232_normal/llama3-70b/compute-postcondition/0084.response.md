The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary that counts occurrences of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` (which is `n-1`) to `n`, `found` is True, indicating that the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `n-1` (if `n` is greater than `n-1`) or undefined (if `n` is not greater than `n-1`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
