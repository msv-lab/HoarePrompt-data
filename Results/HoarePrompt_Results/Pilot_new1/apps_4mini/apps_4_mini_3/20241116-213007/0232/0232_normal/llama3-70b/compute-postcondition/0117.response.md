The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains the count of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `n-1` to `n-1`, `found` is True, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `n-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
