The statement `window_counts[color] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. The initial state indicates that `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, which means `color` has a specific value from the `colors` list. The other variables `color_counts`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new assignment to `window_counts`.

Output State: **`colors` is non-empty, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1, j is i + 1, window_counts[color] is 0**
