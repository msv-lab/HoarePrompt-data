Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that may include the key `color` with a value of 0 if it was not already present. `found` remains False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
