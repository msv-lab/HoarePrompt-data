Postcondition: ***If `colors` is non-empty, `color` is the first element of `colors`, and if `window_counts` contains `color` as a key with its value incremented by 1, then `found` is set to True, and the loop is exited. If `colors` is empty, `color` is an error, and `found` remains False. In both cases, `color_counts`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged, with `found` being True if the condition is met and False otherwise.***
