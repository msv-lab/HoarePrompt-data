The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. The previous state of `window_counts` was empty, and this assignment updates its value. Other variables (`found`, `color_counts`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `color_counts` unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`.

Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `color_counts` unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1**
