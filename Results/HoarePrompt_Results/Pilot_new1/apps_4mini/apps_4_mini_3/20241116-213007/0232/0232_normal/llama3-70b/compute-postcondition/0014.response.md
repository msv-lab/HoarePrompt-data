The variable `color_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. This means that the previous value of `color_counts[color]` is overwritten. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `color` is the third element in the colors list, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, and `color_counts[color]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `color` is the third element in the colors list, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, and `color_counts[color]` is set to 0**.
