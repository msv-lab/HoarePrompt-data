The variable `counts` is assigned the value `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers from user input, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string to an integer. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `colors` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `colors`, along with the new variable `counts` which will hold the list of integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers from user input, and `counts` is a list of integers from user input**
