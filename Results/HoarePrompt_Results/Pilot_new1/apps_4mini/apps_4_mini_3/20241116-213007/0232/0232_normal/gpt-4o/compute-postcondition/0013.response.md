Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers each in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 ≤ ∑ `k[i]` ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, and `current_counts` is adjusted such that at least one count is less than its corresponding value in `desired_counts`. If all values in `current_counts` for each color in `desired_counts` are equal to their corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it does not return anything.***
