Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the key `color`, which is either initialized to `0` if it was not present before, or remains unchanged. `found` is True if counts match, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `j` is `n`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
