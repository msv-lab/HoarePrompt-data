The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing colors and a list of `m` integers representing target counts. It counts the occurrences of each color in the `colors` list and checks if there exists a contiguous subarray of `colors` that matches the target counts specified in `counts`. If such a subarray is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is 0, the function does not perform any operations and directly prints 'NO'.
