According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start from 0 and will increment with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. The initial value of `found` being False does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 and that `i` starts from 0.

State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of colors, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
