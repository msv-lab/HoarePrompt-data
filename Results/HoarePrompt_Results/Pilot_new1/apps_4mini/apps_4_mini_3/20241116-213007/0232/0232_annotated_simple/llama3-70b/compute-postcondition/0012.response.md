The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not already present in `color_counts`, it would have been added with a count of 0 before this operation, and thus after this line, `color_counts[color]` would be 1. If `color` was already present, its previous count would be increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated count for `color_counts[color]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `color` is the second element in the `colors` list, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
