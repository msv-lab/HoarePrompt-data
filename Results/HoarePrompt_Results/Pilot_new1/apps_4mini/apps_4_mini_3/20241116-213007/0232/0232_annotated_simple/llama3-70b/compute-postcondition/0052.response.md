Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop breaks, indicating a match has been found between the sorted values of `window_counts` and `counts`. If `found` is False, the loop continues to execute, and the values of `window_counts`, `counts`, and the indices `i` and `j` remain unchanged, with `window_counts` potentially remaining empty if the loop has not yet executed.***
