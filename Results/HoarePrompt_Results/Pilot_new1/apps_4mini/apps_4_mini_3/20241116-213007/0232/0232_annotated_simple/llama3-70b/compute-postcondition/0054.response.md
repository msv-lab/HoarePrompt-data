The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary. The other variables (`found`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
