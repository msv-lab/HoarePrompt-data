Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i + 2`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is initialized to 0, reflecting that the color has not been counted yet; otherwise, `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
