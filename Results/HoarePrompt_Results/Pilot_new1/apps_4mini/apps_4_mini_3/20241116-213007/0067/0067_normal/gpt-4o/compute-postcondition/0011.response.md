The `print('?')` statement outputs the string `?` to the console. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer within 0 to 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `y` is an integer within 0 to 100, `z` is an integer within 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200, and the output is `?`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer within 0 to 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `y` is an integer within 0 to 100, `z` is an integer within 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200, and the output is `?`**
