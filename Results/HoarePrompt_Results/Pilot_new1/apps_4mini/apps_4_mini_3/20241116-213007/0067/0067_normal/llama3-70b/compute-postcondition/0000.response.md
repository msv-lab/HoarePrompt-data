The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user, where `map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into separate values, and converts them into integers. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are overwritten. Therefore, since the exact input is unknown, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now new integers based on the user's input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are new integers based on user input**
