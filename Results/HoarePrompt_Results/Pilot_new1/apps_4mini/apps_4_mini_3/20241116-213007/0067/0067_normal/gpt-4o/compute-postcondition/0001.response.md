The variable `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`. Since `x` is an integer within the range of 0 to 100, `min_upvotes` will take on the same value as `x`. The states of the other variables `y` and `z` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer within 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `y` is an integer within 0 to 100; `z` is an integer within 0 to 100.

Output State: **`x` is an integer within 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `y` is an integer within 0 to 100; `z` is an integer within 0 to 100**
