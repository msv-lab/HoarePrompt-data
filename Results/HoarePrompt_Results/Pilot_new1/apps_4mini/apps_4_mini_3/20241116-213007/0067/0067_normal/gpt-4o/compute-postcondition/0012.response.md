Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer within 0 to 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `y` is an integer within 0 to 100, `z` is an integer within 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, which is equal to `x`, the function prints '+'. Otherwise, the function prints '?'. This covers all cases including when `max_downvotes` is equal to or greater than `min_upvotes`.***
