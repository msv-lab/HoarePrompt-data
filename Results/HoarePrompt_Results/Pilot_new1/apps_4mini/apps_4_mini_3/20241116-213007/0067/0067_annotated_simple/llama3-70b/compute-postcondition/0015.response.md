Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is equal to 0, the output is '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not equal to 0, the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than `y`, the output is '?'. The conditions that `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z` remain satisfied throughout.***
