The statement `print('+')` outputs the string `'+'` to the console, but it does not change the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. The initial condition states that `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, but this information does not affect the output of the print statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values, while the output from the print statement is noted.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is '+'**
