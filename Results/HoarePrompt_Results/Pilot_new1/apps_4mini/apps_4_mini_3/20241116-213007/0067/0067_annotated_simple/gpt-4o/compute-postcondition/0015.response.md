Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through user input, which represent minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes. It compares these values to determine the relationship between the maximum upvotes (`x + z`) and minimum downvotes (`y`), as well as the maximum downvotes (`y + z`) and minimum upvotes (`x`). The function prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met. The function does not return a value. **
