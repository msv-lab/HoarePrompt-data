Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is equal to 0, '0' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not equal to 0, '?' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `y`, '?' is printed. The value of `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`).***
