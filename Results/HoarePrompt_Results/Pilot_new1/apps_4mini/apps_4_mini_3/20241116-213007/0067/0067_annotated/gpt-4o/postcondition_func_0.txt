The function accepts no parameters and reads three integers from user input, representing minimum upvotes, minimum downvotes, and a range for additional upvotes or downvotes. Based on these values, it prints '-' if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met, indicating that the upvotes and downvotes can overlap or be equal.
