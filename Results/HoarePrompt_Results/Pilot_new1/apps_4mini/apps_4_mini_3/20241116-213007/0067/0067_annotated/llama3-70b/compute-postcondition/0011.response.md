The code executes a print statement that outputs the string `?`. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are not affected by this operation, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the original conditions of `x`, `y`, and `z`, as well as the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. The value of `z` is not equal to 0, the value of `x` is equal to `y`, the value of `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and the value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`); printed output is '?'**
