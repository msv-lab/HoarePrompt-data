The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be assigned new integer values based on the input provided by the user, which will be split into three parts and converted to integers. Since the previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values after the execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now integers based on user input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on user input**
