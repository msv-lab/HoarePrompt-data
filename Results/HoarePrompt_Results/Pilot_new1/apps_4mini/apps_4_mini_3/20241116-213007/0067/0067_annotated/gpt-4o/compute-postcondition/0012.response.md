Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on user input. If the maximum number of downvotes (`y + z`) is less than the minimum number of upvotes (`x`), the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?', indicating that the maximum downvotes are not less than the minimum upvotes, which includes cases where they are equal or the maximum downvotes exceed the minimum upvotes.***
