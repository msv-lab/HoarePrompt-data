Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on user input. If the maximum number of upvotes (`x + z`) is less than the minimum number of downvotes (`y`), a hyphen '-' is printed. If the maximum number of downvotes (`y + z`) is less than the minimum number of upvotes (`x`), a plus sign '+' is printed. Otherwise, a question mark '?' is printed, indicating that the maximum downvotes are not less than the minimum upvotes, which includes cases where they are equal or the maximum downvotes exceed the minimum upvotes.***
