Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers based on user input. `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and the maximum number of downvotes (`y + z`) is less than the minimum number of upvotes (`x`).***
