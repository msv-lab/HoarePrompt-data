To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles various scenarios based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

The program logic is as follows:

1. It checks if the number of upvotes `x` is greater than the sum of downvotes `y` and unknown votes `z`. If this is true, it prints `'+'`.
2. Next, it checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `'-'`.
3. Then, it checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If true, it further checks if `z` is zero. If `z` is zero, it prints `'0'`, otherwise it prints `'?'`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to printing `'?'`.

Now, let's analyze the potential edge cases:

- **Case 1:** If `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`. 
  - According to the program, since `x` is not greater than `y + z`, it would go to the last condition and print `'?'`, which is correct as there are two possible outcomes (either one upvote or one downvote).
  
- **Case 2:** If `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`.
  - The program correctly identifies that `y` is greater than `x` and prints `'-'`.

- **Case 3:** If `x = 2`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`.
  - The program would check if `x > y + z` (2 > 1), which is true, so it prints `'+'`. This is correct.

- **Case 4:** If `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`.
  - The program would recognize that `x` is equal to `y` and since `z` is zero, it prints `'0'`, which is correct.

- **Case 5:** If `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`.
  - The program would check if `x` is equal to `y`, and since `z` is not zero, it would print `'?'`, which is also correct.

- **Case 6:** If `x = 0`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`.
  - The program would check if `x < y`, which is true, and print `'-'`, which is correct.

Upon reviewing all these scenarios, it appears that the program correctly handles all specified cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, after thorough analysis, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
