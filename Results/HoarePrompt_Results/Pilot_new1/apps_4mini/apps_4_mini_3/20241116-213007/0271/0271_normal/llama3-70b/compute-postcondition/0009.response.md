Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is divisible by 10, the function prints `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the function prints the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, the function prints the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`.***
