The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it returns a value based on the constraints that `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Since there are no specific output cases provided, we can conclude that the function will return a value related to the input constraints of `n`. 

However, without additional information on what the function does with `n`, we cannot specify the exact output. Therefore, we can only state that the function is designed to handle a non-negative integer within the given range.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is designed to return a value based on a non-negative integer n within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
