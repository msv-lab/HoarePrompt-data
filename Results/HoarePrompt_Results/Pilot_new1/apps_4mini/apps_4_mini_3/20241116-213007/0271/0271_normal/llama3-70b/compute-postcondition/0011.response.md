Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) as input and prints the nearest multiple of 10. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than `n` if the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, or it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n` if the remainder is greater than 5. The function does not return any value. **
