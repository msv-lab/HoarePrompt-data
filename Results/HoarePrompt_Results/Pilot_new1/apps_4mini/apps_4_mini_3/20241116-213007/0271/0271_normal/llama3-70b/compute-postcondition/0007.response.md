The value of `n` is an input integer that is not a multiple of 10, and since `n % 10` is greater than 5, it can take values such as 6, 7, 8, or 9. The expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` calculates the next multiple of 10 that is greater than `n`. 

The calculation can be broken down as follows:
- `n % 10` gives a value between 6 and 9.
- `10 - n % 10` will yield values of 4, 3, 2, or 1 respectively.
- Adding this result to `n` will yield the next multiple of 10.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` is an input integer within the specified range and that the result of the print statement is the next multiple of 10.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and `n % 10` is greater than 5; the printed result is `n + (10 - n % 10)` which is the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`.**
