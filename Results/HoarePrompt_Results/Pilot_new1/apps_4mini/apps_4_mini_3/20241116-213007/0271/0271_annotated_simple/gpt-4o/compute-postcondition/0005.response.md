The value of `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Given that `remainder` is between 6 and 9, we can calculate the possible values for `result`:

1. If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + (10 - 6) = n + 4`.
2. If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + (10 - 7) = n + 3`.
3. If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + (10 - 8) = n + 2`.
4. If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + (10 - 9) = n + 1`.

Therefore, the value of `result` can be either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`, depending on the specific value of `remainder`. The state of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10` which is greater than 5; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`.**
