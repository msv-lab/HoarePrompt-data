The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since no specific output behavior is provided in the given output section, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on the non-negative integer `n` within the specified bounds without accepting it as a parameter or returning a defined output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a non-negative integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The specific output behavior is not defined.**
