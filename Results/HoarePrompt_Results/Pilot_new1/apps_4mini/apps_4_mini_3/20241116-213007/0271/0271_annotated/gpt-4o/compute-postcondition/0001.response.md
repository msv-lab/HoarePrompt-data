The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, so the possible values for `remainder` will be between 0 and 9. The output state will reflect the value of `n` and the calculated value of `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`**
