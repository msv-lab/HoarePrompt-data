To determine the output state, we need to analyze the initial condition of `n` and how it affects the calculation of `result` based on the given conditions.

1. The initial state indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
2. The code snippet provided is `print(result)`, which implies that `result` must have been calculated based on the value of `n` before this print statement.
3. The calculation of `result` depends on the remainder when `n` is divided by 10:
   - If `remainder <= 5`: `result = n - remainder`
   - If `remainder > 5`: `result = n + (10 - remainder)`

Given that we do not have a specific value for `n`, we need to consider both possible scenarios based on the remainder:

- If the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, then `result` will be `n - remainder`.
- If the remainder is greater than 5, then `result` will be `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Since we do not have the specific value of `n`, we cannot compute an exact value for `result`, but we can describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `result` is either `n - remainder` (if `remainder <= 5`) or `n + (10 - remainder)` (if `remainder > 5`.**
