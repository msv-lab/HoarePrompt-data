Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, 'D' is printed, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain unchanged. If `d_queue` is empty, 'R' is printed, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain unchanged. In either case, the state of both queues is preserved, and the output depends solely on the non-emptiness of `d_queue`.***
