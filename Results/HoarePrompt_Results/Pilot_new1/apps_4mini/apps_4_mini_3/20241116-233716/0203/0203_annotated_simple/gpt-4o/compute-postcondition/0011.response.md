The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `d_queue` will contain the index 0 and the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` contains the indices [0, 1], `r_queue` is empty, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`**
