The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is 0, so after execution, `remocrats` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, and `fraction` is 'R'.
