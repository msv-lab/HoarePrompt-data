The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` is non-empty, meaning there is at least one element to remove. After this operation, `d_index` will hold the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, and `d_queue` will have one less element.

Since `d_index` is assigned the value of the removed first element, and `d_queue` is modified to reflect this change, the output state will reflect the updated state of `d_queue` and the value of `d_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed, `d_index` is the removed first element, `r_queue` is non-empty, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element**
