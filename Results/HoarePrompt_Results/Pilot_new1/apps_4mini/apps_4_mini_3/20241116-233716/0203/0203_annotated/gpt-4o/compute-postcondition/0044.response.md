The code prints the string 'R', which does not affect the values of the variables. The state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `votes` is an empty string, `d_queue` is an empty queue, and `r_queue` is an empty queue.

Output State: **`votes` is an empty string, `d_queue` is an empty queue, and `r_queue` is an empty queue**
