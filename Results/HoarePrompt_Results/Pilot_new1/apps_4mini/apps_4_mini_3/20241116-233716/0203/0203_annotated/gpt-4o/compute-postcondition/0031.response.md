The `r_queue` is modified by appending a new element, which is the sum of `r_index` and `n`. The previous value of `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`, and `n` is an integer value. The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged, and the size of `r_queue` increases by one. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is now one element larger with the last element being `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`.**
