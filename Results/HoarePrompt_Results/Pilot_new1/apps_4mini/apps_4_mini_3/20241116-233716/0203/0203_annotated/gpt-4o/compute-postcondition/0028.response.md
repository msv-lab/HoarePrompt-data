The operation `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` is not empty, this operation will successfully assign a value to `d_index`. The state of `d_queue` will change as its first element is removed, but the specific values of `d_queue` and `d_index` are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `d_queue` is no longer empty and `d_index` has been assigned a value.

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is not empty, and `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`**
