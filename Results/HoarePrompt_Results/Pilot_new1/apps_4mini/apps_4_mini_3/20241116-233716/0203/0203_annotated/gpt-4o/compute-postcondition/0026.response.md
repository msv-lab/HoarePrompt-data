Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are queues where if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`, and `d_index` is updated to the next element from `d_queue` while `r_index` remains unchanged. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`, and `r_index` is updated to the next element from `r_queue`. In both cases, `d_index` and `r_index` are assigned the values of the first elements popped from their respective queues. This ensures that the state of the queues reflects the appropriate updates based on the comparison between `d_index` and `r_index`.***
