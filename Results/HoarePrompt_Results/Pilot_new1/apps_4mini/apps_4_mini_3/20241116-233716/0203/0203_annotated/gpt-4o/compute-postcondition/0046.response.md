The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\). The parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs to produce a result based on the characters in the `votes` string. 

The functionality of the function func is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R', and return a result based on the content of the `votes` string.
