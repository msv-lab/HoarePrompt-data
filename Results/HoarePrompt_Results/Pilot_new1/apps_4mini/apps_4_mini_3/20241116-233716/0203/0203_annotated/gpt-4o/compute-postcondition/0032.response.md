Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` has one less element if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, with `d_index + n` appended to `d_queue`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` has one more element with `r_index + n` appended, and `r_index` retains the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`.***
