The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The value of `d_index` is assigned from the first element of `d_queue`, and since `n` is not specified in the initial state, we will denote it as `n`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` is not empty, so `d_index` will hold a valid value from it. The previous values of the affected variables are `d_queue` (which is not empty) and `r_queue` (which has at least 1 element remaining). 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `d_queue` will have an additional element equal to `d_index + n`, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` has at least 1 element remaining, `d_index` is the first element of `d_queue`, `r_index` is the removed first element of `r_queue`, and `d_queue` now has an additional element `d_index + n`.**
