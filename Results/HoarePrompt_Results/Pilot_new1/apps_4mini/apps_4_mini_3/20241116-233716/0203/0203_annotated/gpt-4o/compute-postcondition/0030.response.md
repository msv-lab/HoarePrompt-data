The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` is not empty, while `r_queue` is one element smaller, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`. However, the specific values of `d_index` and `n` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `d_queue`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is now one element smaller, `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`, and `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`.**
