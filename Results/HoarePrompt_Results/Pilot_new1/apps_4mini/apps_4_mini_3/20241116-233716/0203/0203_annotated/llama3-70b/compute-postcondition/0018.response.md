According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` string. The loop iterates over each character in `fractions`. At the end of the last iteration, `fraction` is the third character in `fractions`, and since `fractions` has a length of at least 3, it implies that there are more characters in the string to iterate over. 

To execute one more time, we need to ensure that `fraction` is set to the next character in the string. Since `fraction` is currently the third character, for the loop to execute one more time, it must be adjusted to the fourth character in `fractions`. 

The length of `fractions` must also be at least 4 to allow for this adjustment. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `fraction` should be the fourth character in `fractions`.
- The length of `fractions` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length at least 4, and `fraction` is the fourth character in `fractions`.**
