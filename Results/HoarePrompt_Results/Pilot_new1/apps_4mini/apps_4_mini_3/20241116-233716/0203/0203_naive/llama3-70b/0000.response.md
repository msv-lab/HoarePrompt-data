Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the voting logic as described in the problem statement. The main issue is that it simply counts the number of employees in each fraction and determines the winner based on which count is higher. This approach fails to account for the voting mechanics where employees can deny others the right to vote in a strategic manner.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
DDRRR
```
In this case, employee 1 (D) can deny employee 5 (R), employee 2 (D) can deny employee 3 (R), and employee 4 (R) can be denied by employee 1 or 2, leading to a scenario where only employee 1 remains eligible to vote, resulting in a victory for depublicans. 

However, the program would incorrectly output 'D' based solely on the counts, without considering the strategic denials that could occur during the voting process.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
