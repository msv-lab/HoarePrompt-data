The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `n` is an integer that is not defined in the initial state but is assumed to be a specific integer. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `r_queue` with the new value appended.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` now has one more element with the value of the last element being `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`**.
