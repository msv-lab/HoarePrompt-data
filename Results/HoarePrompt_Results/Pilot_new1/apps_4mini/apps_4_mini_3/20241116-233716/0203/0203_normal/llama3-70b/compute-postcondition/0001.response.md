The value of `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The initial state of the variable `n` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `n` and the new value of `fractions` as an input string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
