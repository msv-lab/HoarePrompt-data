Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, then the loop will execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty. After the loop, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will be empty. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` will have one more element, which is `d_index + n`, and `r_queue` will have one less element. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` will have one more element, which is `r_index + n`, and `d_queue` will have one less element. If either `d_queue` or `r_queue` is empty at the start (i.e., if `n` is 0), the loop will not execute, and both queues will remain unchanged (empty).**
