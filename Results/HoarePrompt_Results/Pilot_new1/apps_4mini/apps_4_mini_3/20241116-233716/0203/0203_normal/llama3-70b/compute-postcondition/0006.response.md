`depublicans` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0, so after execution, `depublicans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0.
