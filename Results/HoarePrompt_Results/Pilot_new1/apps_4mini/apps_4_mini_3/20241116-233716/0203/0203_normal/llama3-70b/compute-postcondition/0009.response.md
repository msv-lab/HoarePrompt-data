Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `depublicans` being 1 and `remocrats` remaining 0). If `fraction` is 'R', then `remocrats` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `depublicans` remaining 0 and `remocrats` being 1).***
