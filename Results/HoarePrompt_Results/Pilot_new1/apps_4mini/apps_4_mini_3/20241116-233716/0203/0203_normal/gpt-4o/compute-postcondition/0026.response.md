Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one more element if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, with the last element being `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `d_queue` remains with one less element, and `r_queue` has one more element with the last element being `r_index + n`. In both cases, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` has one less element after the operation.***
