The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. However, it operates on two implicit inputs: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of employees, and `fractions`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. 

The function's output is determined by the characters in the `fractions` string. The specific behavior of the function based on the input is not provided, but it can be inferred that it processes the string of 'D' and 'R' characters in relation to the number of employees represented by `n`.

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer n representing the number of employees and a string fractions of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The output is determined by the characters in the fractions string.**
