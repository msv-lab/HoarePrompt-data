The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element that is removed from `r_queue` using the `pop(0)` method. This operation modifies `r_queue` by removing its first element, but does not affect `d_queue` or `d_index`. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, and `d_index` is the value of the removed element from `d_queue`, while `r_index` is the value of the removed element from `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the removed element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the value of the removed element from `r_queue`**
