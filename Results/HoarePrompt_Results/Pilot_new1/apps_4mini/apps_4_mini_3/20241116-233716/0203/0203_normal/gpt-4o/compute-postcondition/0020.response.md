The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. If `n` is at least 1, `d_queue` contains indices of 'D' characters, and thus it will have at least one element. After this operation, `d_queue` will have one less element. If `n` is 0, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty, and popping from an empty list would result in an error. However, since the initial state specifies that `n` is at least 1, we can safely assume that `d_queue` has elements.

Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first index that was in `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`**
