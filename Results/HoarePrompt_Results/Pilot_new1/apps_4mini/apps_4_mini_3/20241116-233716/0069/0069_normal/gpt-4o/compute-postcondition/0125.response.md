Output State: **If T is greater than 0, the loop executes and prints each element in `results`, which is a non-empty list. If T is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`; otherwise, 0 is appended. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated based on valid indices in `prefix_balances`, and this count is appended to `results`. Therefore, after the loop executes, `results` contains the outcomes based on the test cases processed, and `result` is each element printed from the list.**
