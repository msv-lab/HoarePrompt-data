According to the loop statement, the loop will execute `T` times. The loop's execution depends on the value of `T`, which is already specified as a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100). Since `T` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once.

Since the loop runs for `T` iterations, we can set a variable to represent the current iteration. A common approach is to use an underscore (_) as a throwaway variable in Python, but for clarity, we can denote it as `iteration` which will start at 0 and increment with each iteration.

The state does not need to adjust for `n`, `x`, or `s` in terms of their values being valid, as they are already defined within their specified ranges. However, we can denote the current iteration state to reflect which iteration of the loop is currently being executed.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `iteration` is 0**
