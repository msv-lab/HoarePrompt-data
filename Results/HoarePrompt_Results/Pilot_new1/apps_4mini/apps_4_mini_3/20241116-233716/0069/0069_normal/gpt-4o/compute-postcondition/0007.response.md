The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Given that `index` is 1, this means `x` will take the value of `int(data[2])`. The initial state indicates that `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is assigned a value based on `data[1]`. However, the specific value of `data[2]` is not provided, so `x` will depend on that value.

Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])**
