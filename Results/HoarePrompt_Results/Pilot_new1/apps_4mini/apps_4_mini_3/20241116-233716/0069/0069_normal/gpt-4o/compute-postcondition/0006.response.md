The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. Since `index` is 1, `n` will take the integer value of `data[1]`. The values of `T` and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])**
