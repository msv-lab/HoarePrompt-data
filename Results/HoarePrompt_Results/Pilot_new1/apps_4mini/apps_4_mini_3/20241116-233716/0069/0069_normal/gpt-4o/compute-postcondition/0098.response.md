The code appends `0` to the `results` list. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length 1, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes an additional `0`.

Output State: **`n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length 1, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` includes an additional `0`**
