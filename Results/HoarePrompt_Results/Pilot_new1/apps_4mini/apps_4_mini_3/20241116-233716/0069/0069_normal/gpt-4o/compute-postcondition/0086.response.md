According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n`, inclusive. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Given that `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, it implies that the list is valid as long as `n` is non-negative. 

However, to ensure that the loop runs, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 1, as that is the starting point of the range defined in the loop.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
