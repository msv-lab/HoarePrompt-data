The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, and the difference between `x` and `b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`.**
