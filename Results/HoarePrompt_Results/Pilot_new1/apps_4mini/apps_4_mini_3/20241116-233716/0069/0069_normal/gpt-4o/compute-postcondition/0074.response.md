Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a non-empty iterable with at least 4 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, and `index` is 4. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
