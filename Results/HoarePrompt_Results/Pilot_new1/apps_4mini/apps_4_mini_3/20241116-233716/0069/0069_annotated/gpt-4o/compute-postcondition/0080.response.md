The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` is an input value that is converted to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are equal to 0, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, and `n` is `int(data[index])`.
