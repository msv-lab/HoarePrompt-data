The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` will be 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list**
