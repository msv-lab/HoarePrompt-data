The code assigns a new value to `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous value at `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition that checks the character at `s[i - 1]`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is `prefix_balances[2]`, which is already updated as `prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1)`. 

Since `i` is 3, we need to evaluate `prefix_balances[3]` based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the value of `s[2]`. The exact value of `s[2]` is not given, but we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, so `s` must have at least 3 characters.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `prefix_balances[3]` based on the condition applied to `s[2]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and `s[2]`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, and `prefix_balances[2]` is equal to `prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1)`**
