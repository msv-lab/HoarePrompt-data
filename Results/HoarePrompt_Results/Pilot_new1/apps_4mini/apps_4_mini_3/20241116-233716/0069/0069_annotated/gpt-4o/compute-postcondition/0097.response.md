Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative count up to index `i`. `balance` is equal to 0, indicating that the count of '0's is equal to the count of '1's in the string `s`. `x` is an integer derived from `data[index + 1]`, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, and `index` has been increased by 3. The value `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains as initialized with all zeros.***
