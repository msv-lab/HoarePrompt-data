The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are equal to 0; `balance` is 0; `x` is `int(data[index + 1])`; `results` includes `-1`; `T` is greater than the current iteration index; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `s` is `data[index + 2]`; and `index` is increased by 3.
