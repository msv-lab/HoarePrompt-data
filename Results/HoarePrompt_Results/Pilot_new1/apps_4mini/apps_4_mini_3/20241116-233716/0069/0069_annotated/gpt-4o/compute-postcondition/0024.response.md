The code appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The initial state of `prefix_balances` and `balance` does not change with this operation, and the value of `x` remains absent from the `prefix_balances` list. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new state of the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` indicates the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i - 1` in the string `s`; `balance` is 0; `x` is not present in the `prefix_balances` list; `results` now contains an additional element 0.**
