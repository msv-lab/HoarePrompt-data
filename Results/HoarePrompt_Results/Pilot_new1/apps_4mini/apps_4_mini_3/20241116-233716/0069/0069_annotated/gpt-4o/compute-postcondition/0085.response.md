The code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list of length `n + 1`, where the first element is `0` and all other elements are also initialized to `0`. Since `n` is defined as `int(data[index])`, the length of `prefix_balances` will be `n + 1`, and the values of the list will be `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (with `n` zeros). Other variables remain unaffected by this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `prefix_balances`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are equal to 0; `balance` is `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`; `x` is `int(data[index + 1])`; `results` includes `-1`; `T` is greater than the current iteration index; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `s` is `data[index + 2]`; `index` is increased by 3**
