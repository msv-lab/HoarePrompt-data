Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` contains the cumulative sum of `1` for each '0' encountered in the string `s` up to index `i-1`, and `-1` for each '1'. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains as initialized with `prefix_balances[0]` equal to 0 and all other indices also equal to 0.**
