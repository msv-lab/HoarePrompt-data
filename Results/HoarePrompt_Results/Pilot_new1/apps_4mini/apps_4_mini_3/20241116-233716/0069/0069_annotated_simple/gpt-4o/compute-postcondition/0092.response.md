According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at a value between 1 and `n`, and the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. 

Given that `prefix_balances[i]` can be 2, 0, or -2 depending on the value of `s[i - 1]` and the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]`, we need to adjust `i` to be equal to `n + 1` to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Since the loop is set to run from 1 to `n + 1`, and `i` is currently less than or equal to `n`, we can conclude that `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is either 2, 0, or -2 depending on the value of `s[i - 1]` and the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`**
