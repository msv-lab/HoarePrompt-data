Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is `prefix_balances[n]`, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `(x - b)` is not divisible by `balance` or `(x - b) // balance` is negative, the value of `count` remains unchanged.***
