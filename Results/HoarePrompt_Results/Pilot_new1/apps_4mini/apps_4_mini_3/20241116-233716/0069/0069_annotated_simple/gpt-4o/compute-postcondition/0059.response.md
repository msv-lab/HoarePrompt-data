The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes `-1`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1**
