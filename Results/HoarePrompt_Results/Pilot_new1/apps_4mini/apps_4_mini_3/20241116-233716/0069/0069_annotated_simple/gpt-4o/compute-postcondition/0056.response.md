Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance based on the number of '0's and '1's in the first `i` characters of string `s`. If `s[i - 1]` is '0', `prefix_balances[i]` is `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1`; if `s[i - 1]` is '1', it is `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `1`.**
