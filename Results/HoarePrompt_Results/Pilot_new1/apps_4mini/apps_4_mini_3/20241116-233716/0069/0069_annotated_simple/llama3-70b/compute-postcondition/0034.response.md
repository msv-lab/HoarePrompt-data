Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is defined as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. Special consideration is given when `cnt0` equals `cnt1` to avoid division by zero, which may lead to undefined behavior in the context of the problem.***
