According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it can still accommodate `i` being 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted as they remain valid for the next iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros; `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1'); `x` is an input integer from `data[index + 1]`; `results` contains -1; `T` is greater than 1; `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]; `index` is increased by 3; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`.**
