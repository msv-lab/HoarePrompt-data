According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`, and the loop is set to run until `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `2`. The value of `prefix_balances[1]` is already determined based on `s[0]`, so no changes are needed there. 

The state of `prefix_balances[i]` is based on the previous iteration and should remain consistent with the updates made in the last iteration. The value of `n` should remain unchanged, as it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`, `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`, `i` is 2**
