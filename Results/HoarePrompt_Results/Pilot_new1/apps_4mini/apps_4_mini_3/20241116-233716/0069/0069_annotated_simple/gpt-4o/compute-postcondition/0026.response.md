Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, where the balance is not equal to 0, indicating that there is an imbalance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`. If `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` has been updated from index 1 to `n`, and if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.***
