The code prints `n + 1`. The value of `n` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Therefore, `n + 1` will be a positive integer between 2 and 100001. The other variables (`x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the function prints `n + 1`**.
