According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n + 1`, meaning it will execute for `i` values starting from `1` up to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be `n` for the loop to execute one more time. Since the loop iterates until `i` reaches `n + 1`, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1` to allow the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `i` is now `n + 1`, and no other states need to be adjusted since `prefix_balances` is already updated based on the value of `s[0]`.

State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `i` is n + 1**
