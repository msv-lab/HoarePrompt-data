According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 4 outputs, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 3 outputs. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must contain at least 4 outputs, and the `result` variable should refer to the fourth output in the list.

State: **`results` contains at least 4 outputs, `T` is greater than 0, `n` can be any value, and the function prints the value of the fourth output in `results`**
