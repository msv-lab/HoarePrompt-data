The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the result of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. The value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is not specified, but `s[i - 1]` can either be '0' or '1', leading to two possible outcomes for the addition: if `s[i - 1]` is '0', it adds 1, and if it's '1', it subtracts 1. The variable `i` is `n + 1`. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1'; `i` is `n + 1`; `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1'; `i` is `n + 1`; `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]**
