The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 2`, `count` is increased by 1, and `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 2`, `count` is increased by 1, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`**
