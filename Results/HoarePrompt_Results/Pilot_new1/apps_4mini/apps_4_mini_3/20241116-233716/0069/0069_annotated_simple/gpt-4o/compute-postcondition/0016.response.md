According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. Additionally, since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it must also be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing, as `i` will then be less than or equal to `n`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be updated to 3.
- `n` should be updated to be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, and `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and `s[2]`.**
