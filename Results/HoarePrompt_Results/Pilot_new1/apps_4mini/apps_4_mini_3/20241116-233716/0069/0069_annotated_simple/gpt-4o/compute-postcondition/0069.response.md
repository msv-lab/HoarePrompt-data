According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the `prefix_balances` list. The loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in `prefix_balances` to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, meaning it contains `n + 1` elements (from index 0 to index n). Since `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for at least one index `i` (where 1 ≤ i ≤ n), `prefix_balances[i]` is not equal to 0, we know that the loop has iterated over the elements of `prefix_balances` up to an index that is less than `n`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop will continue to the next element in the list. If the loop has just finished processing the last element at index `n-1`, then the next element to process would be at index `n`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that the loop is now processing the last element in `prefix_balances`, which is `prefix_balances[n]`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is `prefix_balances[n]`**
