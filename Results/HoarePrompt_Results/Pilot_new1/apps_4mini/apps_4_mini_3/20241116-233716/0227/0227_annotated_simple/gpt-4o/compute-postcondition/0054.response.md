The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, but it already holds the value `True`. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `assigned`.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `assigned**
