The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
