Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged, and no further actions are taken.***
