Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, with `x` being the third element in `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, the loop is exited. If the condition is not met, the values of `can_form`, `m`, `assigned`, `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, with `can_form` still being True and `m` incremented by 1 regardless of the condition outcome.***
