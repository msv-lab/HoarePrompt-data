The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. Parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 23\). Parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer satisfies \(1 \leq a[k] \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it returns the count of distinct integers in `a` that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers, and return the count of distinct integers in `a` that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers, and returns the count of distinct integers in a that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned integers.**
