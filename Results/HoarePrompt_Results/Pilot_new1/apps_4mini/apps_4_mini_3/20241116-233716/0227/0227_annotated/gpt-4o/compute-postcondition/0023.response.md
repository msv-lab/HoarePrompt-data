Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `assigned` contains fewer than 2 elements, `can_form` remains False, and thus `m` is also incremented by 1 in that case. Therefore, `m` is incremented by 1 if `can_form` is False or if `assigned` has fewer than 2 elements.***
