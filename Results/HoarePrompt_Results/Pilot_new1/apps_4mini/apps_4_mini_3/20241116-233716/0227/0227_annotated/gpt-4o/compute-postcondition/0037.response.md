The value of `can_form` is assigned to `True`, which remains unchanged as it was already `True`. The other variables, including `m`, `assigned`, and `x`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains at least one more element, `x` is the next element in the list `assigned`**
