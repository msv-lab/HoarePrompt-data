The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into components, and `map(int, ...)` converts each component to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, the list `a` will contain `n` distinct integers based on the user input. The previous values of `n` and `a` are affected, as `a` will now hold the integers provided through input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `a` and the existing state of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a list of n distinct integers based on input**
