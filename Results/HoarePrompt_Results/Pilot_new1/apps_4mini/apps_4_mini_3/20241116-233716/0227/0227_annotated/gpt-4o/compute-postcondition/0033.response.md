The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, which is already its current value. The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, and `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` has at least one more element, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` has at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `assigned`**
