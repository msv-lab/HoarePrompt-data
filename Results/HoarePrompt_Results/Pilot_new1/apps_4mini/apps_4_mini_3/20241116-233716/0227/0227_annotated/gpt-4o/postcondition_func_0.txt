The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It returns the count of distinct integers in `a` that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned integers. If `n` is 1, it will return 1 since there are no pairs to form a sum. The function effectively counts how many integers in the sorted list cannot be expressed as the sum of any two integers that have been processed so far.
