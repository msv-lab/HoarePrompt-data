The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, with `x` being the fourth element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
