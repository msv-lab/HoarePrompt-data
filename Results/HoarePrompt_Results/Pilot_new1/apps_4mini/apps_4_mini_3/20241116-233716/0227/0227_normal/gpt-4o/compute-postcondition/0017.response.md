The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 2 distinct positive integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the next element in `assigned` (after the current one), and `can_form` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
