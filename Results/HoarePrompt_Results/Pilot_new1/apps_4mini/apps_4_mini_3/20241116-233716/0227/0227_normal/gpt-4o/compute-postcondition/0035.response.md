Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[3]` and `x` is in `assigned`, and `m` remains unchanged. The variable `assigned` includes `a[3]`, `n` is greater than 3, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
