The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The previous states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False**
