The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[i]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `a[2]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
