Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `assigned` includes at least 3 elements, `m` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 3, and `x` is the third element in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
