Postcondition: ***If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `x`, and `assigned` are unchanged, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains unchanged, and `m` remains unchanged, with `a`, `x`, and `assigned` also unchanged.***
