Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list and counts how many elements in `a` cannot be formed as the difference of any two elements from a set of previously considered elements. The function returns this count, which represents the number of elements in `a` that cannot be expressed as such differences. **
