The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state indicates that `can_form` is already `True`, so there is no change in its value. The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, `i`, and `n`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[i]`, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[i]`, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3**
