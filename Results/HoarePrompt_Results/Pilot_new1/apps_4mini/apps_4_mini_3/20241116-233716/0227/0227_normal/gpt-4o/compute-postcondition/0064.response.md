The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown. The values of `can_form` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` is greater than 3. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `i` is 3, `m` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 3.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `i` is 3, `m` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 3**
