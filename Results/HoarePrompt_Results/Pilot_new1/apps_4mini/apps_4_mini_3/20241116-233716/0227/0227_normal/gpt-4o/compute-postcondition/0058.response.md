The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`i`, `assigned`, `m`, `n`, and `x`). Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `assigned` includes at least 3 elements, `m` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
