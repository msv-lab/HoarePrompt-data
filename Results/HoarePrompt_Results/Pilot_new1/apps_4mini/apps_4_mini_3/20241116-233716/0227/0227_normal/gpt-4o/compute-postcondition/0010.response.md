Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If this difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, and the program continues to execute without breaking.***
