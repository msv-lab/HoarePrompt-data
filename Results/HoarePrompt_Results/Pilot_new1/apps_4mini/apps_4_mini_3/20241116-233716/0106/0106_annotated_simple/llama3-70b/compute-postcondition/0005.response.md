Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new positive integer values from input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1.**
