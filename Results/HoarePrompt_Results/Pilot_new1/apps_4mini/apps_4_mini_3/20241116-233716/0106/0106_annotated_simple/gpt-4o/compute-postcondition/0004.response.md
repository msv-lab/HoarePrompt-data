The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer that represents a specific apartment number within a defined range. The function performs calculations based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are positive integers constrained between 1 and 1000, and `a` and `b`, which are distinct integers constrained between 1 and `n·m·k`. Based on these calculations, the function returns the values of `block` and `floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding values of `block` and `floor` based on defined calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on calculations involving the integers n, m, and k.**
