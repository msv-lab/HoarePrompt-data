To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the impact of the provided code snippet.

1. The initial state indicates that `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`. This means that `direct_walk_time` is already defined based on the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`. However, we do not have specific values for these variables.

2. The code snippet calculates `reverse_walk_time` using the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. 

3. The value of `reverse_walk_time` is dependent on the same variables `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`. The expression `abs(block_a - block_b)` is the same in both calculations.

4. The output state will reflect the new variable `reverse_walk_time` being assigned a value based on the current values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`.

Since we don't have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`, we can only express the relationship in general terms.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**
