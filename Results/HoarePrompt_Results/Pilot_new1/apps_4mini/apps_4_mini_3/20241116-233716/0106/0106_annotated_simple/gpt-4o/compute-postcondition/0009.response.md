To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` based on the initial state provided. 

1. **Initial Calculations**:
   - `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
   - `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The line `min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)` assigns the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` to `min_walk_time`.
   - The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are unaffected by this assignment; they maintain their previously calculated values.

Since we do not have the specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`, we cannot compute exact numerical values for `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, or `min_walk_time`. However, we can state that `min_walk_time` is determined based on the minimum of the two previously calculated times.

Thus, the output state reflects that `min_walk_time` is assigned a value based on the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
