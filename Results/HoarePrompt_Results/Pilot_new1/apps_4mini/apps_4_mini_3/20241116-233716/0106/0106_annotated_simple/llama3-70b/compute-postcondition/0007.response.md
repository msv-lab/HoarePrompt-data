Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers updated from input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; and `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15. Additionally, `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.***
