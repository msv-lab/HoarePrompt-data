The value of `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `m` and `k` are positive integers, and `a` is a distinct integer. The calculation of `a_block` depends on the specific values of `a`, `m`, and `k`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for these variables, we cannot determine the exact value of `a_block`. However, we can express the relationship based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new positive integer values from input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1.**
