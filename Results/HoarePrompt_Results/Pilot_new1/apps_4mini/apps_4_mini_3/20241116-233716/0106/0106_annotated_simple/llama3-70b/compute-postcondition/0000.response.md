The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned based on the input provided by the user. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not known, but they are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated with new input values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new positive integer values from input; `a` and `b` remain distinct integers within the specified range.**
