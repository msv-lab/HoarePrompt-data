Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values from the function `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is greater than 1, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 + (`floor_a` - 1), which means `time_to_exit` will be at least 10 when `floor_a` is 2, and will increase by 1 for each additional floor above 1. Thus, `time_to_exit` will always be 0 for `floor_a` equal to 1 and will be at least 10 for any `floor_a` greater than 1.***
