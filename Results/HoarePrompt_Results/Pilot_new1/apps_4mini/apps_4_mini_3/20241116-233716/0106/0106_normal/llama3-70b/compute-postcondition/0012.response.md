Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input; `a` is an integer from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_block` is undefined; `b_floor` is undefined; `min_floor_time` cannot be calculated; thus, `print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)` results in an error due to `min_floor_time` being undefined.**
