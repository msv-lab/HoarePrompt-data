The function accepts five integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` represent dimensions and `a` and `b` represent specific locations within those dimensions. It calculates the total time required to exit from the location `a` to the location `b`, considering the time to exit the current floor, the walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The function returns this total time, which may not account for scenarios where `a` or `b` might not be valid locations within the specified bounds.
