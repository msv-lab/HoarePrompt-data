The code snippet calculates `min_floor_time` using the formula `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. However, `b_block` and `b_floor` are undefined, which means that the calculation cannot proceed. Since `min_block_time` cannot be calculated either, we cannot determine the value of `min_floor_time`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `b_block` and `b_floor` remain undefined, and the calculation of `min_floor_time` cannot be completed.

Output State: **`b_block` is undefined, `b_floor` is undefined, and min_floor_time cannot be calculated.**
