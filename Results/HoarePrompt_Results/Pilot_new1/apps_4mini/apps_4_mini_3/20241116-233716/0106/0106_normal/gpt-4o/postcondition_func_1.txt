The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates which `block` and `floor` the apartment is located in based on the total number of apartments per block (`m * k`) and the number of floors (`k`). It returns a tuple containing the calculated `block` and `floor`. However, the function assumes that `m` and `k` are defined elsewhere in the code, which could lead to errors if they are not properly initialized. Additionally, there are no checks for negative or zero values for `apartment`, which could result in incorrect calculations.
