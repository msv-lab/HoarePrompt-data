To calculate `reverse_walk_time`, we use the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The initial state mentions that `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, but we do not have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`. 

The value of `reverse_walk_time` is determined as follows:
1. Calculate `abs(block_a - block_b)`, which is the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`.
2. Subtract this value from `n`.
3. Take the result modulo `n`.
4. Multiply by 15 to get `reverse_walk_time`.

Since we do not have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`, we cannot compute exact numeric values. Therefore, the output state will reflect the formula used for `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**
