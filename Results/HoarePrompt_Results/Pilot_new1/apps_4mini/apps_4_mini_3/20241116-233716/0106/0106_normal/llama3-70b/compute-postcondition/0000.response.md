The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values based on the input provided by the user, which are integers in the range of 1 to 1000. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown as they will be replaced by the new input values. Other variables `a` and `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `n`, `m`, and `k` based on the input received.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input, `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
