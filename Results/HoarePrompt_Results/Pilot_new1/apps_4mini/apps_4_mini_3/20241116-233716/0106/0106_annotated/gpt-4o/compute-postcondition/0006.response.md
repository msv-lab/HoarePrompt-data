Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer representing an apartment number; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of apartment `a`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of apartment `b` which is not defined. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is greater than 1, then `time_to_exit` is equal to `floor_a + 9`, covering all cases for the value of `floor_a`.***
