The code assigns a value to `time_to_target_floor`, which is calculated based on the value of `floor_b`. However, `floor_b` is not defined in the initial state, so the calculation cannot be performed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `floor_b` is undefined, and the `time_to_target_floor` cannot be calculated.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer representing an apartment number; `block_a` is defined; `block_b` is not defined; `reverse_walk_time` cannot be calculated due to the undefined value of `block_b; min_walk_time` cannot be determined; `time_to_target_floor` cannot be calculated due to the undefined value of `floor_b`.**
