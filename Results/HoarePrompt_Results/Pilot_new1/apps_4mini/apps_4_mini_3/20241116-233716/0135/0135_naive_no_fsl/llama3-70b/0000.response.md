To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic of the program in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to check if all the remainders of `n` when divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The program should output "Yes" if they are distinct, and "No" if there are any duplicates.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Set for Tracking**: It uses a set `seen` to track the remainders that have been encountered.
3. **Loop from 1 to k**: The program iterates through each integer `i` from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i`.
4. **Checking for Duplicates**: If the calculated remainder is already in the `seen` set, it prints "No" and exits. If not, it adds the remainder to the set.
5. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints "Yes".

### Edge Cases:
1. **When k = 1**: The only remainder calculated will be `n % 1`, which is always `0`. This is distinct as there are no other values to compare against. The output should be "Yes".
2. **When k = n**: Remainders will range from `0` to `n-1` for values of `i` from `1` to `n`. This will always result in distinct remainders.
3. **When k > n**: For `i` values greater than `n`, `n % i` will be `n`, which could potentially lead to duplicates if `k` is significantly larger than `n`.

### Potential Failing Case:
Consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 6`. The remainders would be:
- `5 % 1 = 0`
- `5 % 2 = 1`
- `5 % 3 = 2`
- `5 % 4 = 1` (duplicate)
- `5 % 5 = 0` (duplicate)
- `5 % 6 = 5`

In this case, the program will output "No", which is correct. However, if `k` were much larger than `n`, the program might not account for the fact that remainders for `i` values greater than `n` are always `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle cases where `k > n` as it does not consider that for any `i > n`, `n % i` will yield `n` and can lead to duplicates with previous remainders. 

Thus, the program fails for cases where `k` is significantly larger than `n`. 

Correctness: **False**
