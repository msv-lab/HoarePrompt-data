To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and identify any potential edge cases.

The program takes two integers, `n` and `k`, and checks if all the remainders of `n` divided by all integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the seen remainders and checks for duplicates.

Here's the relevant part of the logic:
- It iterates over the range from 1 to `k`.
- It calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by `i`.
- If the remainder has already been seen (exists in the set), it prints "No" and exits.
- If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes".

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
1. When `k` is 1, the only remainder is `n % 1`, which is always 0. Therefore, the output should always be "Yes" since there are no other remainders to compare.
2. When `n` is less than `k`, the remainders will be distinct for all values of `i` from 1 to `n` (since `n % i` will yield values from `0` to `n-1`).
3. The program does not handle large values of `k` efficiently. For instance, if `k` is significantly larger than `n`, the loop will still run up to `k`, which means it will compute remainders for numbers that are larger than `n`. This could lead to unnecessary calculations and potential performance issues, but it does not affect the correctness of the output.

However, the most critical observation is:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders will start repeating because `n % n` is 0, which will be the same as `n % 1` (which is also 0). Thus, for any `k >= n`, the output should be "No".

This logic is not explicitly handled in the provided code, which means it could produce incorrect results for cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.

For example:
- If `n = 4` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be: 
  - `4 % 1 = 0`
  - `4 % 2 = 0`
  - `4 % 3 = 1`
  - `4 % 4 = 0`
  - `4 % 5 = 4`
  This leads to duplicates (0 appears multiple times), so the correct output should be "No", but the logic fails to account for this correctly.

Therefore, the program does not handle the case where `k >= n` properly, leading to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **False**.
