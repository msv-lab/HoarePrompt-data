According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 3. Additionally, since `i` must remain less than or equal to `k`, `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to be able to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
