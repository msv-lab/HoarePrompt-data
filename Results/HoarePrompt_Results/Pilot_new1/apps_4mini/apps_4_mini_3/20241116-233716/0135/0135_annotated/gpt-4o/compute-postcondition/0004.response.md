According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k`. The variable `i` will take on values from 1 to `k` during the iterations. 

Since the state indicates that `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1. The `seen_remainders` set being empty does not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are that `k` must be at least 1 and `i` is now 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
