The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 1, so the calculation will be `n % 1`, which is always 0 for any integer `n`. The other variables (`k`, `seen`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
