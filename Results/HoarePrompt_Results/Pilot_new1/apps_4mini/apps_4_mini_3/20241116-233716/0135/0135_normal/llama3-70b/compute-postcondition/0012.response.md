The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. The output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values. Thus, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, the function prints 'No', and the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, the function prints 'No', and the program exits.**
