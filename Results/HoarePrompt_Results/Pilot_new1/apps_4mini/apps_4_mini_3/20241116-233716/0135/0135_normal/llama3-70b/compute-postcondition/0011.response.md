The code prints 'No', which does not change the values of any variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and the function prints 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and the function prints 'No'**.
