The code `print('No')` outputs the string 'No' to the console. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder`) remain unchanged as this statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0, and the output is 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the output is 'No'**.
