The value of `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. Given that `i` is 2, `remainder` will be equal to `n % 2`, which will yield either 0 or 1 depending on whether `n` is even or odd. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
