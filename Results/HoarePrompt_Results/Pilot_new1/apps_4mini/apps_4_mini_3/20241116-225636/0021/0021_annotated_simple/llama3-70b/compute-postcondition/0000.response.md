The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state of `n` is that it is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`. The value of `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `n` is an input integer**
