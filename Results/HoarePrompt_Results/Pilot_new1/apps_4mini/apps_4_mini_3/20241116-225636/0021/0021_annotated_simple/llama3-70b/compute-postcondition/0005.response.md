The code assigns `min_dist` the value of the minimum between two expressions: `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100, and `max_dist` is defined but not directly affected by this code. The values of `pos1` and `posn` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact values of `min_dist`. Therefore, the output state reflects the dependencies on `pos1`, `posn`, and the constraints on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `max_dist` is the maximum of (abs(pos1 - posn) - 1) and (`n` - 2); `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
