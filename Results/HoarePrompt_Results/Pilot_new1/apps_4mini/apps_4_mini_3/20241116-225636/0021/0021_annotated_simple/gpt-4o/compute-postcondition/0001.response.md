The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. The input will be a space-separated string of integers, which will be converted into a list of integers. The previous value of `n` does not directly affect the outcome of this operation, as `n` is not used in this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now a list of integers based on user input, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers based on user input**
