The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. After executing the function body, the output is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, based on the constraints and relationships, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range 1 to n). The specific return value is not provided.**
