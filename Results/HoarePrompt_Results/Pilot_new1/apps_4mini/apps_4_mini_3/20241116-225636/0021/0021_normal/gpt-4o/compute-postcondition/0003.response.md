The variable `max_pos` is assigned the value of `a.index(n)`, which returns the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The initial state provides that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`. The previous values of `min_pos` and `a` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `min_pos` and `a`, along with the new value of `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`.**
