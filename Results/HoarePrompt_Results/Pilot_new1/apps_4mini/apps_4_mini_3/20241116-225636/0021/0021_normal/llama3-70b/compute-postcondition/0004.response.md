To analyze the code:

1. `max_dist` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
2. The expression involves two calculations:
   - `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`: This calculates the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, subtracting 1 from that difference.
   - `n - 2`: This calculates the value of `n` decreased by 2.
3. The maximum of these two values is taken to set `max_dist`.

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the values of `pos1` and `posn` will be specific indices in the list `a`. However, without specific values for `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`, we cannot compute exact numerical results but can describe the relationship.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of the element 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of the element `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
