The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes an input string, splits it into separate components, converts each component to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its value is still an integer between 2 and 100. The output state will reflect the new value of `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`**
