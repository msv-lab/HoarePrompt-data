The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, which represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100) and a list `a` (of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of size `n`), and it returns a result based on these inputs.**
