To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem states that Nicholas has a permutation of size n, and he wants to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by performing exactly one swap.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers representing the permutation.
2. **Position Finding**: It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) using `index()`.
3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - It calculates the current distance between the positions of 1 and n using `abs(pos1 - posn)`.
   - It attempts to calculate the maximum possible distance after one swap, but the logic for this is convoluted and not straightforward.
   - The variables `max_dist` and `min_dist` are calculated, but they don't seem to directly correlate with the maximum possible distance achievable through a single swap.

### Edge Cases

1. **Already Maximized Distance**: If the permutation is such that 1 is at index 0 and n is at index n-1 (e.g., `1, 2, 3, ..., n`), the distance is already maximized (n-1). The program should ideally recognize that no swap is necessary, but it still performs a swap.
  
2. **Positions of 1 and n**: If 1 is at index 0 and n is at index 1 (or vice versa), the distance is only 1. The program should swap these elements with the ones at the opposite ends of the list to maximize the distance.

3. **General Case**: The logic for calculating `max_dist` and `min_dist` seems flawed. The calculation `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` does not guarantee the maximum distance after a swap, and the use of `min` is confusing in this context.

### Conclusion

Given the potential cases where the program does not correctly compute the maximum distance after one swap (particularly in edge cases where elements are adjacent or already maximized), the program cannot be guaranteed to work as described for all inputs.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

### Example Case Where It Fails
For the input:
```
2
1 2
```
The expected output is `1` (the maximum distance after one swap), but the program would output `0`, which is incorrect.
