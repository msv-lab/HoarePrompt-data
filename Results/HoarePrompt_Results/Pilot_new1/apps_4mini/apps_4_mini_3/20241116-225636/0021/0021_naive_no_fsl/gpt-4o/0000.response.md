To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
2. We need to find the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements.
3. We want to maximize the distance between these two elements by performing exactly one swap.

### Given Program Logic:
- The program reads the integer `n` and the permutation `a`.
- It finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements using `a.index(1)` and `a.index(n)`.
- It calculates the distances from the minimum and maximum elements to both ends of the array (index 0 and index n-1).
- Finally, it determines the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program calculates distances to the ends of the array but does not consider the actual positions of the minimum and maximum elements relative to each other after a swap.
2. It does not check if the current positions of 1 and n are already at the maximum possible distance without any swap, which could lead to incorrect results if it assumes a swap is always necessary.

### Example to Test:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- Here, the minimum (1) is at position 0 and the maximum (5) is at position 4.
- The current distance is `abs(0 - 4) = 4`, which is already maximum.
- The program will calculate the distances as follows:
  - `dist1 = abs(0 - 4) = 4`
  - `dist2 = abs(4 - 4) = 0`
  - `dist3 = abs(0 - 0) = 0`
  - `dist4 = abs(4 - 0) = 4`
- The program will return `4`, which is correct, but it does not consider that no swap is needed.

Now consider another input:
```
3
3 1 2
```
- Here, the minimum (1) is at position 1 and the maximum (3) is at position 0.
- The current distance is `abs(1 - 0) = 1`.
- The program will calculate the distances as follows:
  - `dist1 = abs(0 - 1) = 1`
  - `dist2 = abs(2 - 1) = 1`
  - `dist3 = abs(0 - 1) = 1`
  - `dist4 = abs(2 - 1) = 1`
- The program will return `1`, which is incorrect because we can swap 3 and 2 to achieve a distance of `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the requirement to maximize the distance after a swap, as it does not explicitly check the potential new positions of the minimum and maximum after performing a swap. Therefore, it can produce incorrect results for certain cases.

Correctness: **False**
