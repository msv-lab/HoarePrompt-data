The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state of `n` is not affected as it is being reassigned. The list `a` remains unchanged as there is no operation affecting it. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n**
