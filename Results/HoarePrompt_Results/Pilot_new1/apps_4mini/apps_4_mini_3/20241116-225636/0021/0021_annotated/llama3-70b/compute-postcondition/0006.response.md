To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`
   - `min_dist` is the minimum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The code `print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))` calculates the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

3. **Impact on Variables**: 
   - The values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` are used in the calculation, but they are not modified by the `print` statement. The result of the `max` function is simply printed.

4. **Output State**: 
   - The output state reflects the values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` as they were initially set, along with the computed result of the `max` function.

Thus, the output state will include the initial definitions of `max_dist` and `min_dist` along with the result of the `max` function.

Output State: **`max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2; `min_dist` is the minimum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2; the function prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.**
