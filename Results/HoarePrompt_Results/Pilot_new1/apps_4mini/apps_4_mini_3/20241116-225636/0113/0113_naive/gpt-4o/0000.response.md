To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential input cases.

The problem requires finding the minimum positive integer \( x \) such that \( x \) ends with \( k \) or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by \( n \). 

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))
```

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the Multiplier**: The variable `multiplier` is set to \( 10^k \). This is correct as we need \( x \) to be a multiple of \( 10^k \) to ensure it ends with at least \( k \) zeros.

2. **Calculating x**: The formula used to calculate \( x \) is:
   \[
   x = n \times \left(\frac{10^k}{\text{gcd}(n, 10^k)}\right)
   \]
   This is meant to adjust \( n \) so that the result is divisible by \( 10^k \). The use of the greatest common divisor (GCD) helps to find the least multiplier needed to ensure that \( n \) becomes a multiple of \( 10^k \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **k = 0**: The output should simply be \( n \) because any number is divisible by itself and does not need any additional zeros. The program correctly returns \( n \) when \( k = 0 \).
   - **k > 0**: The logic should work for positive \( k \) as it multiplies \( n \) by the necessary factor to ensure divisibility by \( 10^k \).

### Testing the Program

Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Input**: `375 4`
   - Expected output: `30000`
   - Calculation: \( 375 \times \left(\frac{10000}{\text{gcd}(375, 10000)}\right) = 375 \times 80 = 30000 \) (Correct)

2. **Input**: `10000 1`
   - Expected output: `10000`
   - Calculation: \( 10000 \times \left(\frac{10}{\text{gcd}(10000, 10)}\right) = 10000 \) (Correct)

3. **Input**: `38101 0`
   - Expected output: `38101`
   - Calculation: \( 38101 \) (Correct)

4. **Input**: `123456789 8`
   - Expected output: `12345678900000000`
   - Calculation: \( 123456789 \times \left(\frac{100000000}{\text{gcd}(123456789, 100000000)}\right) \)
   - GCD calculation: Since \( 123456789 \) and \( 100000000 \) share no common factors, the GCD is 1.
   - Therefore, \( x = 123456789 \times 100000000 = 12345678900000000 \) (Correct)

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program against the problem statement and testing several inputs, it appears that the program correctly implements the required functionality for all tested cases, including edge cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the k-rounding of \( n \) based on the logic described in the problem statement.
