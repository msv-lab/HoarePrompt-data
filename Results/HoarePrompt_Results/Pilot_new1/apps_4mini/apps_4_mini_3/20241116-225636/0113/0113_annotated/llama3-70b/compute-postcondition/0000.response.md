The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` takes a space-separated input and converts them to integers. The initial values of `n` and `k` are not specified beyond their constraints, but they will be replaced with the input values. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k` as input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8)**
