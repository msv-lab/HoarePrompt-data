The value of `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to 8, the possible values for `x` will be `1` (when `k` is `0`), `10` (when `k` is `1`), `100` (when `k` is `2`), `1000` (when `k` is `3`), `10000` (when `k` is `4`), `100000` (when `k` is `5`), `1000000` (when `k` is `6`), `10000000` (when `k` is `7`), and `100000000` (when `k` is `8`). The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is an input non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
