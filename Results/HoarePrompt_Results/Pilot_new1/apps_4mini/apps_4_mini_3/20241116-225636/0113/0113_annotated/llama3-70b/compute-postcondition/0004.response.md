The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is an input positive integer that is not a multiple of `10^k`, after the execution, `n` will be `n + 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1**
