The value of `x` is assigned the result of `10 ** k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8. This means `x` will be equal to 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 depending on the value of `k`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is equal to `10 ** k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is equal to `10 ** k`**
