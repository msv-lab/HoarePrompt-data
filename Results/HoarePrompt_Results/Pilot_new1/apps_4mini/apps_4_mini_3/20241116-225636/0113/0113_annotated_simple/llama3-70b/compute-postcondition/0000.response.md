The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input()` accepts two integers separated by space and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now the input positive integer and `k` is now the input non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
