The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 + 1 and `n % 10` is not equal to 0, after the execution, `n` will be `n + 1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer, and `x` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer, and `x` is 10**
