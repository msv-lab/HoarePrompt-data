Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as \(10^k\), and returns the value of \(x\), which is computed as \(n\) multiplied by the quotient of the multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of \(n\) and the multiplier. There are no explicit checks for the validity of the inputs, so if `n` is not positive or `k` is negative, the function may not behave as intended. **
