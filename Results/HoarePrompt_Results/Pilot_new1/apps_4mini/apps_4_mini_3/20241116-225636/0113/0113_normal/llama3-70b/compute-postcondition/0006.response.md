The value of `n` is incremented by 1, where `n` is an input positive integer that is not equal to \(10^k\). Therefore, after execution, `n` becomes `n + 1`. The previous state of `n` is not specified, but it is confirmed to be a positive integer. The output state reflects the change in the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer increased by 1**
