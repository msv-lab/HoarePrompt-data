The variable `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are taken from `bus_routes[1]`, and `t` is between 1 and 100000. The exact values of `s_i` and `d_i` are not specified, but they are part of the tuple at index 1 of the `bus_routes` list. The operation involves the modulus operator and subtraction, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state will include the values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, and the computed `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
