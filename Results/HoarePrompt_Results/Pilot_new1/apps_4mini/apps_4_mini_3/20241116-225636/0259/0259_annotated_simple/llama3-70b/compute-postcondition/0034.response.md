The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `t`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). `t` is also a positive integer representing the number of queries, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 100000\). Additionally, for each bus route, `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers representing the start and destination of the route, with the constraints \(1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 100000\). 

After executing the function body, the function processes the bus routes and queries to return a result based on those inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (the number of bus routes) and `t` (the number of queries), and processes bus routes defined by pairs of positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` to return results based on those routes and queries.**
