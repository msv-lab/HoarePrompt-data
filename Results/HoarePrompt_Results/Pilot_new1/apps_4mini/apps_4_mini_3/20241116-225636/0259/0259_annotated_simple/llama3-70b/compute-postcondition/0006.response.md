The code snippet assigns values to `s` and `d` by reading input and splitting it into two integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `s` and `d` are now assigned values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is a list containing one tuple (s, d), and `s`, `d` are input integers.**
