To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

1. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is between 1 and 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples `(s_i, d_i)`. 
2. The code snippet assigns `s_i` and `d_i` from `bus_routes[2]`. Thus, we need to know the values of `s_i` and `d_i` from the third tuple in the `bus_routes` list.
3. The `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

Since the exact values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not provided, we can only describe the relationships and calculations based on the initial state.

- `wait_time` is computed based on the values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. 
- Other variables (`n`, `i`, `min_wait_time`, and `bus_routes`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state can be articulated as follows:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
