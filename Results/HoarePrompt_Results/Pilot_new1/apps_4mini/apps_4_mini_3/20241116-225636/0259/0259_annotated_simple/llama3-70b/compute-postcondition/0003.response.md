The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input, which is split into two parts and converted to integers. The initial values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and indicates that `s` and `d` are set based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are input integers**
