According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 3 (incremented by 1).
- `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity.**
