Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, an integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains two integers representing the start time and the frequency of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for the buses and returns the index (1-indexed) of the bus route that offers the shortest wait time. If no suitable bus routes are found (i.e., if `n` is 0 or all routes have a wait time greater than or equal to positive infinity), it returns -1. **
