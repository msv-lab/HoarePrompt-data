The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the calculation results in `ans` being 3. The states of the other variables (`buses`, `(s, d)`, and `min_time`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2, `(s, d)` is the third tuple in the buses list, `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, and `ans` is 3.

Output State: **`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2, `(s, d)` is the third tuple in the buses list, `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, and `ans` is 3**.
