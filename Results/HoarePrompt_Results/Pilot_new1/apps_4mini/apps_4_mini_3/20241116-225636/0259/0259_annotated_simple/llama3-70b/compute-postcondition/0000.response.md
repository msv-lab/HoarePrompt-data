The values of `n` and `t` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which is then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000). Since the actual input values are not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `n` and `t`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `t` have been assigned new values based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000)**
