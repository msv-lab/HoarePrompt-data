Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum time calculated as `(t - s) % d` for the buses in the list, and `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus that gives this minimum time. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains positive infinity and `ans` remains -1. If `buses` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute for each tuple, updating `min_time` and `ans` based on the computed `time`.**
