Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, indicating the selected bus route. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, and `chosen_route` does not get updated. This ensures that the wait time and chosen route accurately reflect the best option available based on the calculated wait time for the bus routes.***
