The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is 0.
