The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100).
- `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000).

After executing the function body, it returns the index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time, referred to as `chosen_route`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of bus routes represented as tuples, and return the index of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a positive integer t, and a list of tuples bus_routes, and returns the index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time.**
