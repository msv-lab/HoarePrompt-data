Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `wait_time` is updated based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i` from `bus_routes[n]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` remain unchanged. This ensures all scenarios where `s_i` is compared to `t` are handled, including the edge cases where `s_i` equals `t` or when `s_i` is less than `t` and divisible by `d_i`.***
