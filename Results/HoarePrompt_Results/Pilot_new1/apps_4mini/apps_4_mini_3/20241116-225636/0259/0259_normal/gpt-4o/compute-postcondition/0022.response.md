Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` is bus_routes[1][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[1][1], and `wait_time` is 0 if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which ensures that the wait time is non-negative and reflects the next bus arrival based on the current time `t` and the schedule defined by `s_i` and `d_i`.***
