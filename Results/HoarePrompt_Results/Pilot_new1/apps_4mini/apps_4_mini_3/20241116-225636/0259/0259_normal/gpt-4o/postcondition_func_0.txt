The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`. It calculates the minimum wait time for the bus routes based on their departure times and intervals and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route that provides this minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the function returns -1, indicating that there are no bus routes available.
