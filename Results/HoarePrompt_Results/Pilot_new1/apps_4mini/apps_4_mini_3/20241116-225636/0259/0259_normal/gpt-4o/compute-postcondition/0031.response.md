The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are taken from `bus_routes[n]`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The values of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000. Since `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged, they do not affect the output state.

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculation of `wait_time` based on the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`.

Output State: **`wait_time` is calculated from `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, `min_wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is unchanged, `i` is `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.**
