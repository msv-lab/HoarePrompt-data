The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Since `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the result of this subtraction will be non-negative. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t**
