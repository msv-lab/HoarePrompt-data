According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), the loop will execute at least once, starting with `i` at 0. The initial values of `t`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` do not affect the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the confirmation that `n` is a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**
