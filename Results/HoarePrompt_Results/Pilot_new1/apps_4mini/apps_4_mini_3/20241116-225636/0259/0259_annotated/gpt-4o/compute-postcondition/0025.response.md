The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 1, so `chosen_route` will be 1 + 1, which equals 2. The other variables `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged in their respective states. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are values assigned from `bus_routes[1]`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are values assigned from `bus_routes[1]`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 2**
