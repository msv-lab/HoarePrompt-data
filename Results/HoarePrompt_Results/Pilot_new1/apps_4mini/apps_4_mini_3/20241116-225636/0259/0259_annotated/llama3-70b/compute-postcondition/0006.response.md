The code assigns values to `s` and `d` by accepting input and splitting it into two integers. The previous values of `s` and `d` are not known, as they are being assigned new values from the input. The variable `buses` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `s` and `d` as input integers.

Output State: **`n` is between 0 and 99, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple (s, d), `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
