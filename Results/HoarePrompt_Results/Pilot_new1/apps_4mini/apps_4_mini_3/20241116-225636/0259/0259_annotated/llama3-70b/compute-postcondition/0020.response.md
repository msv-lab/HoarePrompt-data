Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list containing at least one tuple, `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1` if `time` is less than `min_time`. If `time` is not less than `min_time`, then `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged. The variable `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, where `s` is the first element and `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`.***
