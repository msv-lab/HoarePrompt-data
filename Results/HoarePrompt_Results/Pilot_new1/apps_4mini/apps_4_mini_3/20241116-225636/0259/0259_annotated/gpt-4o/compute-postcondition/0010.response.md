To calculate the `wait_time`, we need to consider the values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` based on the initial state. 

- `s_i` is less than `t`, meaning `t - s_i` is a positive integer.
- `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, indicating that `t - s_i` is not a multiple of `d_i`.

The expression for `wait_time` is given by:
```
wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
```

Since `(t - s_i) % d_i` is a positive integer (as `d_i` is a divisor of a positive integer), we can denote it as `r`, where `0 < r < d_i`. Thus, we can express `wait_time` as:
```
wait_time = d_i - r
```

This calculation shows that `wait_time` will yield a positive integer since `r` is strictly less than `d_i`.

Therefore, the output state will include the values of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `t`, and the calculated `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, `d_i` is a positive integer, and `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
