Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum value of `(t - s) % d` for all tuples in `buses`, where `s` is the first element and `d` is the second element of each tuple, and `ans` is the index (1-based) of the tuple that produced this minimum time. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains float('inf') and `ans` remains -1. If `buses` contains at least one tuple, the loop executes for each tuple, updating `min_time` and `ans` as described.**
