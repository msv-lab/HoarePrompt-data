Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is a positive integer representing the time until the next bus arrives. This covers all cases, including when `s_i` equals `t`, and ensures that `wait_time` remains non-negative.***
