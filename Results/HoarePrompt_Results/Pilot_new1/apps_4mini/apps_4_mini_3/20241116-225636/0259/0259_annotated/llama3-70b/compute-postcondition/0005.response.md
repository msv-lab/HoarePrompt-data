According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as the number of iterations specified by `n` has not been exhausted. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 100, indicating that there are still iterations left. 

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state directly, we do not need to adjust any variables related to the loop body. However, we need to adjust `n` to reflect that one iteration has occurred, meaning `n` should be decreased by 1 to indicate that there is one less iteration remaining.

Thus, the new state should reflect that `n` is now between 0 and 99 (since it was between 1 and 100 before the iteration).

State: **`n` is between 0 and 99, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple (s, d), and `s`, `d` are input integers**
