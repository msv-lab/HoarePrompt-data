Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a positive integer representing the time until the next bus arrives. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to 1. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This ensures that the minimum wait time and the corresponding route are correctly identified.***
