According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, it is guaranteed that `n` is greater than `i` at this point (0). 

No other states need to be adjusted since `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` are not affected by the loop control variables.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is unchanged**
