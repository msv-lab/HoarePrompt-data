The values of `n` and `t` are assigned the values obtained from `input()` split into two parts and converted to integers. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000. The specific values for `n` and `t` are not provided, so they remain as input integers. The other variables `s_i` and `d_i` are not affected at this stage.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100000**
