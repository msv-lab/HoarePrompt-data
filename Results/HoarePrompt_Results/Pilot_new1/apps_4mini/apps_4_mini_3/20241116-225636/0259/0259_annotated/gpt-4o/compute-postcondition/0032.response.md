Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at the current time. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives based on the current time `t` and the schedule defined by `s_i` and `d_i`.***
