The value of `max_divisor` is reassigned to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Given that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, the value of `gcd // i` will be a non-negative integer. The exact outcome for `max_divisor` will depend on the specific values of `gcd` and `i`. 

Since `max_divisor` can either be `gcd` or `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the greater of these two values and `gcd // i`. The output state will reflect that `max_divisor` has been updated based on the comparison.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`, and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1**
