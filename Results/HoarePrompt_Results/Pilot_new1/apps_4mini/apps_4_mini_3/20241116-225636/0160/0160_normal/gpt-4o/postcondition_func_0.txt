The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first element `lst[0]` and all subsequent elements in the list. If the list has fewer than 1 element, it may raise an error due to accessing `lst[0]`. If the list has only one element, it returns that element as the GCD. If the list is empty, it will result in an IndexError.
