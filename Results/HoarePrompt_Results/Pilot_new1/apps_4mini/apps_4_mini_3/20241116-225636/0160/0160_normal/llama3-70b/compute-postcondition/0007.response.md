According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `N` is between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and since `N` is greater than 2, it will still satisfy the loop condition.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 3.

The other states (`N`, `K`, `A`, and `gcd`) do not need to be changed since they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is updated to `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2]), `i` is 3**
