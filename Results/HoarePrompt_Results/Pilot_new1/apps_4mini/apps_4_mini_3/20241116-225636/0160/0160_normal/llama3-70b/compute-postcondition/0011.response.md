The variable `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is the greatest common divisor of the elements in list `A` from index 0 to N-1. The value of `gcd` is not changed by this assignment. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the elements in list `A` from index 0 to N-1; `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`.

Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the elements in list `A` from index 0 to N-1; `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`**
