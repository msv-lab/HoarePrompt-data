The variable `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` of the list `A`. The initial value of `gcd` is `A[0]`, and `i` is currently 1, so the new value of `gcd` will be `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `A` are not directly affected by this operation, and `i` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is updated to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`, and `i` is 1.
