The variable `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of its current value and the element `A[i]`, where `i` is 1. The previous value of `gcd` is `A[0]`, and the value of `A[1]` is unknown but is an integer from the list `A`. Therefore, the new value of `gcd` will be `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `K` is a non-negative integer, `A` is a list of N integers, `gcd` is math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), `i` is 1**
