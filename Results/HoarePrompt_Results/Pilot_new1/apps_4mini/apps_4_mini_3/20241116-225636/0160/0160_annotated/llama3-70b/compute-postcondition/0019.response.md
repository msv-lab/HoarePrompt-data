According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. 

To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the value of `gcd`. Since `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than 0, we know that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `i` should be updated to 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `gcd` is greater than 0, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1, and we need to ensure that it is at least 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than 0, and `i` is 2.**
