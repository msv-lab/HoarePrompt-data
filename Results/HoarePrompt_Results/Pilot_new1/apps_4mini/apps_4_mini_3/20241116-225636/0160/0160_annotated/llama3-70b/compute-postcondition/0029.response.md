According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than 4. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` (which is 3) is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `gcd` is greater than 4, `sqrt(gcd)` is greater than 2, and thus `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should become 4. We also need to ensure that `max_divisor` remains unchanged since the loop body is omitted and we don't know if any updates to `max_divisor` would occur in the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` is now 4.

State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than 4, `i` is 4**
