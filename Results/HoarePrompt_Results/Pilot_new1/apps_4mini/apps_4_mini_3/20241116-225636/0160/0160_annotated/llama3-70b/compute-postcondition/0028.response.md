Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than 4, and `i` is 3. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `3`. If `3 * 3` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` may also be updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // 3`. If `3 * 3` is equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
