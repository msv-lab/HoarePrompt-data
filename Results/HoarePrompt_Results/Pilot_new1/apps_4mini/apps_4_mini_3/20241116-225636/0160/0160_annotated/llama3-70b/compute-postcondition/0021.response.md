To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables based on the initial state. 

1. The variable `max_divisor` is either `gcd` (if `gcd` > 2) or 2 (if `gcd` ≤ 2).
2. The variable `i` is 2.
3. The code assigns `max_divisor` the maximum value between its current value and the result of `gcd // i`.

Let's consider the two scenarios for `max_divisor`:

- If `gcd > 2`, then `max_divisor` is initialized to `gcd`. The new value of `max_divisor` will be `max(gcd, gcd // 2)`. Since `gcd // 2` is less than `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains `gcd`.

- If `gcd ≤ 2`, then `max_divisor` is initialized to 2. The new value of `max_divisor` will be `max(2, gcd // 2)`. Since `gcd // 2` will be 1 (if `gcd` is 2) or 0 (if `gcd` is 1 or 0), `max_divisor` remains 2.

Thus, the output state will reflect the new value of `max_divisor` based on the value of `gcd`.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is either `gcd` (if `gcd` > 2) or 2 (if `gcd` ≤ 2); `i` is 2**
