The value of `max_divisor` is reassigned to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Since `max_divisor` is greater than 4 and `i` is 3, the output state will depend on the value of `gcd`. However, without knowing the specific value of `gcd`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `max_divisor`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum function.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // 3`, `i` is 3**
