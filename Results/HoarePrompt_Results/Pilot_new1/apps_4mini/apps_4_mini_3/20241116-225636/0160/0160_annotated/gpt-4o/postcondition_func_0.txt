The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. If the list contains fewer than two elements or is empty, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle these cases, potentially leading to an error. If the list has only one element, it returns that element as the GCD.
