According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 4, meaning `N` is greater than or equal to 4. Since the loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to determine the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration.

If we assume the loop executed for the last time with `i` being the highest value less than `N`, the maximum value of `i` could be `N-1` (if `N` is greater than 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `N-1` and `N` should remain at least 4.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is now equal to `N-1`, which means `N` must be at least 5.

State: **`N` is at least 5, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is updated to gcd(gcd, A[3]), `i` is N-1**
