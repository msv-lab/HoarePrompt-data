To evaluate the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the logic and functionality of the two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Function Analysis

1. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers `lst`.
   - The GCD is calculated iteratively using the `math.gcd` function. The final result is the GCD of all elements in the list.
   - The comment correctly describes that `gcd_result` will contain the GCD of all elements in `lst`.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(x)`**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given integer `x` and returns them in descending order.
   - The logic iterates from 1 to the square root of `x`, checking if `i` is a divisor of `x`. If it is, both `i` and `x // i` are added to the set of divisors.
   - The comment accurately explains the behavior of the loop and the contents of the `divisors` set.

### Problem Requirements
The problem requires us to perform operations on a sequence of integers to maximize the largest integer that can divide all elements after performing up to `K` operations. The operations allow us to adjust the integers by adding or subtracting values.

### Key Considerations
- The program does not appear to implement the logic for performing the operations (adding 1 to one integer and subtracting 1 from another) as described in the problem statement.
- The program only computes the GCD of the original list and finds the divisors of this GCD, but it does not account for the potential changes to the integers based on the operations allowed (up to `K` times).
- The maximum divisor that can divide all elements after operations must consider the effects of those operations, which the current implementation does not address.

### Example Case
Consider the input:
```
2 3
8 20
```
- The expected output is `7`, which is achievable by performing operations to adjust the numbers.
- However, the provided code does not perform any operations and simply returns the GCD of the original numbers, which would be `4` in this case. The divisors of `4` are `1`, `2`, and `4`, none of which meet the requirement.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the required logic to handle the operations and therefore cannot guarantee the correct output for all potential inputs based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
