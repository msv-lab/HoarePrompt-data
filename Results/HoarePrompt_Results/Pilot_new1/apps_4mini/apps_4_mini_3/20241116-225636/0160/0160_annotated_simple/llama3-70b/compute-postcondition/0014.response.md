The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 1, `max_divisor` will either remain the same or become 1, depending on its initial value. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from input, `gcd` is divisible by `i`, and `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 1.
