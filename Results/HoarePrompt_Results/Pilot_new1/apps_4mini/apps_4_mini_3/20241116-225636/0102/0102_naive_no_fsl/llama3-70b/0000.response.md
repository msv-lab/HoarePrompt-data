Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts the integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its English word representation according to the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads an integer input `s` which is guaranteed to be between 0 and 99, inclusive.

2. **Mapping Numbers to Words**:
   - For numbers less than 10, it uses the `ones` list to return the corresponding word.
   - For numbers between 10 and 19, it uses the `teens` list to return the correct word.
   - For numbers 20 and above, it calculates the tens and ones separately using the `tens` list and the `ones` list, and combines them with a hyphen if necessary.

3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the word representation without any spaces, as required.

The program correctly handles all edge cases:
- It correctly outputs "zero" for the score of 0 (though "zero" is not explicitly mentioned in the examples, it is implied by the range).
- It correctly outputs "ninety-nine" for the score of 99.
- It also handles numbers like 21 (outputting "twenty-one") and 30 (outputting "thirty") appropriately.

Since the program meets all specified requirements and handles all potential edge cases, I conclude that it is correct.
