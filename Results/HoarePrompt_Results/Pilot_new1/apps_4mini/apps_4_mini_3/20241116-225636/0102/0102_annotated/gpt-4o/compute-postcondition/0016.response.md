Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; `n` is an integer such that if `11 <= n <= 19`, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `10 <= n <= 99`, and `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens' + '-' + 'ones'. Cases where `n` is less than 10 or greater than 99 are not handled in this fragment, and thus the behavior for those values is unspecified.***
