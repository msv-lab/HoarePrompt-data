Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens' + '-' + 'ones', where 'tens' corresponds to the tens place of `n` and 'ones' corresponds to the units place of `n`. Cases where `n` is less than 10 or greater than 19 are not handled in this fragment.***
