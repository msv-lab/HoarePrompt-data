Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place for `n` (i.e., `tens[n // 10]`). If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens' + '-' + 'ones', where 'tens' is the word for the tens place of `n` and 'ones' is the word for the units place of `n`. This handles all cases for `n` in the specified range, including the boundaries of 10 and 99.***
