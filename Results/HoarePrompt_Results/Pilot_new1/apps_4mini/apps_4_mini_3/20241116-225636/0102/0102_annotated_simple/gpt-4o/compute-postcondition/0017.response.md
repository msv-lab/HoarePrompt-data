Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the string representation from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the string representation from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive, if `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. Cases where `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99 are not applicable due to the precondition.***
