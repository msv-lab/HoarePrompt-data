Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input score is 0. According to the problem description, the valid range for the score is from 0 to 99, and the output for the score of 0 should be "zero". However, the provided program does not include a condition to process the score of 0, which will result in an index error when attempting to access `ones[0]`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for all potential inputs.
