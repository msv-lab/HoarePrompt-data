To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description:
The task is to convert an integer score (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) into its English word representation, using hyphens for numbers like twenty-one, thirty-two, etc., and ensuring that the output consists only of lowercase letters and hyphens.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']
    
    if 0 <= n <= 9:
        return ones[n]
    elif 11 <= n <= 19:
        return teens[n - 10]
    elif 10 <= n <= 99:
        if n % 10 == 0:
            return tens[n // 10]
        else:
            return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = int(input())
    print(func_1(s))
```

### Testing the Code:
1. **Numbers 0 to 9**:
   - The code correctly maps single-digit numbers to their corresponding words using the `ones` list.

2. **Numbers 10 and 20**:
   - The code correctly handles `10` by returning `ten`.
   - The code handles `20` correctly by returning `twenty`.

3. **Numbers 11 to 19**:
   - The code correctly handles numbers from `11` to `19` using the `teens` list, but it does not handle `10` properly since it is also included in the range of `10 to 19`. The check for `11 <= n <= 19` does not account for `10`, which is handled separately.

4. **Numbers 21 to 99**:
   - The code correctly forms numbers like `21` (twenty-one) and `32` (thirty-two) using the `tens` and `ones` lists.

### Edge Cases:
- The code does not handle the number `10` correctly. It should be included in the range for `10 to 19`, but it is treated separately. This could lead to confusion in the output or incorrect handling.
- The code does not handle the number `0` correctly, as it should return `zero`, which is handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the number `10` correctly as per the description. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
