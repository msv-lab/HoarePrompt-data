The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, reflecting the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains `remainder` (0), `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No'**
