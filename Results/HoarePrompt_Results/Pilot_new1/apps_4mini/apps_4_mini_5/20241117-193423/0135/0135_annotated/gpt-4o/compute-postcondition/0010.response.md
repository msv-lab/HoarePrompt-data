The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. Since `i` is 2, `remainder` will be the remainder of `n` when divided by 2. The exact value of `remainder` will depend on whether `n` is even or odd. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is less than `n`, `i` is 2, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 (if `n` is even) or 1 (if `n` is odd).

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is less than `n`, `i` is 2, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
