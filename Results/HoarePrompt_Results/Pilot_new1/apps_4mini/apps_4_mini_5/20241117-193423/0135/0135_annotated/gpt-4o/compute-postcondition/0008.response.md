Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is less than `n`, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Since `seen_remainders` is initially empty, the function will return 'No' only if `remainder` is added to `seen_remainders` before this check, otherwise, it will not return 'No'.***
