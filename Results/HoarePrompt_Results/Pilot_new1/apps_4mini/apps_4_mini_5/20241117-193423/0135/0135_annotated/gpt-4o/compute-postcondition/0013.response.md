According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is at least 3. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Additionally, since `k` is at least 3, it must be adjusted to be at least 4 for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` should be at least 4 to allow the loop to continue executing.
- `i` should be incremented to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
