According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, as `i` cannot exceed `k`. 

Since `remainder` is either 0 or 1 and `seen` contains `remainder` (0), those states do not need to be adjusted for this specific loop iteration. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains `remainder` (0), `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No'**
