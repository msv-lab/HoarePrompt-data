Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that may or may not contain the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and terminates. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution without any output or termination at this point.***
