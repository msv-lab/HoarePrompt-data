According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1 since `range(1, k + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to and including `k`. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 1 on the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
