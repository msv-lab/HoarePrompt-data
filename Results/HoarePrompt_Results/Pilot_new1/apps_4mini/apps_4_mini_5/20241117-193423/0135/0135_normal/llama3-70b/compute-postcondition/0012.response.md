The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program will stop execution at this point. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program has exited without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` is a set that includes 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the function prints 'No', and the program exits.**
