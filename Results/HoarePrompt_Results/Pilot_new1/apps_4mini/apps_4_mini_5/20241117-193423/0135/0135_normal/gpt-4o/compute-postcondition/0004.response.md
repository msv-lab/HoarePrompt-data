According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute for each integer `i` from 1 to `k`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start from 1 at the beginning of the first iteration. The state of `n` does not directly affect the execution of the loop, and `seen_remainders` being an empty set is also not relevant for the loop's execution.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `k` is at least 1 and set the initial value of `i` to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
