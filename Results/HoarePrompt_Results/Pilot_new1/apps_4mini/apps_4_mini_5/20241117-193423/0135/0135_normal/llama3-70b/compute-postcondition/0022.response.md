Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute up to k times, calculating the remainder of n divided by i for each i from 1 to k. The variable `seen` will contain all unique remainders found during these iterations. If a remainder is found in `seen` during any iteration, 'No' will be printed and the program will exit. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains an empty set.**
