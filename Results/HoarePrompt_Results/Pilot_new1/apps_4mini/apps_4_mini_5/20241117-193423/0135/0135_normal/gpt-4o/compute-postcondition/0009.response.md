According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `k` does not need to be adjusted as it is already greater than or equal to 1, allowing for `i` to be less than or equal to `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0**
