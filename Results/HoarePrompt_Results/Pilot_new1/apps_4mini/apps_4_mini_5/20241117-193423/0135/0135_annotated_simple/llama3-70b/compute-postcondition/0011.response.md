The code executes a print statement that outputs 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the action of printing.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and 'No' is printed.**
