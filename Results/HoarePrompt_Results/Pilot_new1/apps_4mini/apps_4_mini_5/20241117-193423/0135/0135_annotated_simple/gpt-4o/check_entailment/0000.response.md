To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the logic of the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to determine if all remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we are looking for any pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i = n % j`.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k >= n) :
        return 'No'
        # The program returns 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n.
        
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
        
    return 'Yes'
    # The program returns 'Yes' if all remainders are distinct.
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Check if `k >= n`:** 
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program immediately returns `'No'`. This is incorrect because if `k` is greater than `n`, the remainders will not necessarily be non-distinct. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` which are distinct.
   
2. **Loop through `1` to `k`:**
   - The program calculates `n % i` for each `i` from `1` to `k` and checks if the remainder has been seen before.
   - If a remainder is found in `seen_remainders`, it returns `'No'`.
   - If all remainders are distinct, it returns `'Yes'`.

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:
- Consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 4`. The expected output is `'No'` because `4 % 1 = 0` and `4 % 4 = 0`, which are not distinct. 
- Now consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 5`. The expected output should be `'Yes'` because the remainders are `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` which are distinct. However, the program would incorrectly return `'No'` because `k` is greater than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the case when `k >= n` and does not account for all potential values of `k`. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
