Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, and `seen` contains both its previous values and the value of `remainder` which is assigned the value of `n % i`. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the output is 'No', indicating that a duplicate remainder has been detected; otherwise, the program continues without any output.***
