The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change due to the exit, but the program will stop running. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and 'No' is printed.
