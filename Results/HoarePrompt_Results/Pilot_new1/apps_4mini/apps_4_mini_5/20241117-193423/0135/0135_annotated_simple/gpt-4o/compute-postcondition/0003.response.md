The code initializes an empty set called `seen_remainders`. The initial values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. The previous conditions regarding the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `n` and `k` retain their previous integer values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
