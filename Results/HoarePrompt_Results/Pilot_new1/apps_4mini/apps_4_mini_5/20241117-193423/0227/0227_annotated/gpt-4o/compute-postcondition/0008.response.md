The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`. This changes the previous value of `can_form`, which was `False`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `can_form` while retaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`.**
