The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and since `m` was initially 1, after execution, `m` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains elements from `a`, `m` is 2, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains elements from `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 1**
