The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The input will provide `n` distinct positive integers, which are valid according to the initial state constraints. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers from input.**
