Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `m` is 1. If `a[i]` is not equal to twice the value of `a[i - 1]`, then `m` is incremented by 1, resulting in `m` being 2. If `a[i]` is equal to twice the value of `a[i - 1]`, then `m` remains 1.***
