Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`. It sorts the list and counts the number of distinct groups of integers that cannot be formed from the differences of the elements in the list. The function returns this count, which ranges from 1 to `n`, indicating the number of distinct groups based on the conditions met during the loop's execution. If `n` is 1, it will return 1, as there are no pairs to form differences.**
