Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the value of `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, while `m` remains either 2 or 3, `assigned` contains at least one element, and `i` is a valid index ensuring that `a[i + 1]` is also valid. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, maintaining its initial state.***
