The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least two elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
