Postcondition: ***`can_form` is set to True if the difference between `a[3]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2. If the condition is met, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `can_form`, `m`, or `assigned`.***
