According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the `assigned` list. The loop can execute again if there is at least one more element in the `assigned` list after the current iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `assigned` contains at least 1 element, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the `assigned` list needs to contain at least 3 elements, because `i` needs to be incremented to 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the size of the `assigned` list and the value of `i`. Specifically, `assigned` must contain at least 3 elements, `i` should be 3, and `n` can remain greater than 2.

State: **`can_form` is set to True if the difference between `a[2]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2**
