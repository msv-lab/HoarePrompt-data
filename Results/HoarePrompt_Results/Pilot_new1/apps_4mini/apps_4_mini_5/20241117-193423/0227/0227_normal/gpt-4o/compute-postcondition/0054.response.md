The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not depend on the previous values of any other variables, and it does not affect them either. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new assignment.

Output State: **`assigned` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
