The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, so it changes from `False` to `True`. The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, `i`, `n`, and `a[2] - x`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is now `True`, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 1 element (specifically, `a[2]`), `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 1 element (specifically, `a[2]`), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
