Postcondition: ***`can_form` is set to True if the difference between `a[4]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, which contains at least 3 elements. If this condition is met, `m` is increased by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, there is no change to `can_form`, `m`, or `assigned`. Additionally, `i` remains equal to 4 and `n` is greater than 2 throughout this process.***
