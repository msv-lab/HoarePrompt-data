The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
