Postcondition: ***`assigned` has at least 1 element (specifically `a[3]`), `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and if the difference between `a[3]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False.***
