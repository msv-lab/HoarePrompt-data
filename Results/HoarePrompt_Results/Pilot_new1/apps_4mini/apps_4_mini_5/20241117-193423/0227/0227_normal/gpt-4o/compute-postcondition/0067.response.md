According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value which is `1` (as it starts from `1` and increments with each loop iteration). 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `2`. The value of `n` must be greater than `2` for the loop to continue executing.

There are no other states that need to be adjusted based on the information provided. 

State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains an additional element `a[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
