The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values, which are split into separate strings. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers. The values of `a` will be determined by the user's input. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `n` and the newly assigned list `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers based on user input.**
