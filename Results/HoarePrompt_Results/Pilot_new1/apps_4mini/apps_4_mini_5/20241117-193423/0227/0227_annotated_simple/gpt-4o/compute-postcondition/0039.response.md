Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False initially. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` (where `x` is the third element in `assigned`) exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, and `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.***
