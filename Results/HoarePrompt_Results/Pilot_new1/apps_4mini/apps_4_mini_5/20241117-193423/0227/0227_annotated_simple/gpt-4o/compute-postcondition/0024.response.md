Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists at least one value in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and that value is also in `assigned`; if `can_form` is False, and `n` is greater than 1 with `i` equal to 1, then `m` is increased by 1; if `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and `m` is increased by 1 only if `n` is greater than 1; `assigned` now includes the value `a[i]`.**
