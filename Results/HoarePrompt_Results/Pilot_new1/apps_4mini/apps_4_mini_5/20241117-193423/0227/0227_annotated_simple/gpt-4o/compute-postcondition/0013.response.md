The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is an iterable containing at least 2 elements, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
