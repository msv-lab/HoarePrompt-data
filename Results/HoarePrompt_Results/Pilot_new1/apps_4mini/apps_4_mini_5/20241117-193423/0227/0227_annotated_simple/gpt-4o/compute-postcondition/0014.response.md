Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is an iterable containing at least 2 elements, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `x` is the second element in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If this condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing the subsequent code.***
