The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown since it is not provided in the initial state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `m` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `m` is increased by 1**
