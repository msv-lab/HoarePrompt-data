Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list and counts how many values in `a` cannot form a difference with any previously assigned value in the set. If `n` is 1, it returns 1, otherwise it returns the count of values for which no previous assigned value can form the difference with the current `a[i]`. **
