The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not depend on any previous values of the affected variables, and the other variables (`n`, `i`, `assigned`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `can_form` while maintaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is an iterable containing at least 2 elements, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, `can_form` is True**
