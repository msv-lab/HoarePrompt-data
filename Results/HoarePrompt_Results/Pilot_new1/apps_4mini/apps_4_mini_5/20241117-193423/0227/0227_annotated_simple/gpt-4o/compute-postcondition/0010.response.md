Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is an iterable containing at least 1 element, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
