Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1, while `n` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `x` is the last element of `assigned` if `assigned` is not empty. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and the loop does not execute, leaving `m` unchanged. If `can_form` is True, then `m` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `x` is the last element of `assigned` if `assigned` is not empty.***
