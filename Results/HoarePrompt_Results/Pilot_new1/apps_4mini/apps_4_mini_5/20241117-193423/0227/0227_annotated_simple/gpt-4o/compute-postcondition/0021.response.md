Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, indicating that there is no value in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and that value is also in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop did not execute, confirming that `can_form` remains False. Additionally, `n` is greater than 1, `i` remains 1, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers.***
