Postcondition: ***`votes` is a string, `d_queue` is non-empty, and `r_queue` may be empty or non-empty. If `d_queue` is non-empty, it contains indices of 'D' characters shifted by multiples of `n`. If `r_queue` is non-empty, it contains indices of non-'D' characters shifted similarly. The loop has executed, and the state of the queues reflects the shifting based on the presence of 'D' characters in `votes`.***
