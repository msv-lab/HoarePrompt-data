The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before it was popped, and `n` is an integer that adds to this value. The state of `d_queue` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less index after popping the first element, `r_queue` has one less element, `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was popped, and `r_queue` now has an additional element which is `r_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less index after popping the first element, `r_queue` has one less element, `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was popped, and `r_queue` now has an additional element which is `r_index + n`.**
