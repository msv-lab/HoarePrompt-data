Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of non-'D' characters in `fractions`, and `fractions` is a string of length `n`. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the output is 'D'. If `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the output is 'R'. If `n` is 0, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are 0, and 'R' is printed.***
