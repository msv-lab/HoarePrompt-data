The variable `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, which is removed from `r_queue` using the `pop(0)` method. This operation affects `r_queue` by reducing its size by one element, and `r_index` now holds the value of the element that was at the front of `r_queue`. The other variables, `d_queue` and `d_index`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` while `r_queue` has one less element.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` has one less element**
