The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `d_queue` will contain the single element [0]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `v` is 'D'.
