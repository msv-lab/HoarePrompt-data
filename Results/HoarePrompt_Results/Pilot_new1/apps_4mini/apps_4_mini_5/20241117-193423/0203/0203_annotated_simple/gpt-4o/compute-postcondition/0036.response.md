The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous state indicates that `d_queue` has one less element, and `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`. The value of `n` is not specified, so it remains as a variable in the output state. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and we append `d_index + n` to `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and we append `d_index + n` to `d_queue`.**
