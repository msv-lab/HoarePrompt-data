The `d_queue` is modified by appending the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The initial state specifies that `d_queue` can either be [0] if the first character of `votes`, `v`, is 'D' or an empty list if `v` is not 'D'. Regardless of its initial state, appending 1 will change its state. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `d_queue`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` is either [0, 1] if `v` is 'D' or [1] if `v` is not 'D'; `r_queue` is either an empty list if `v` is 'D' or contains the value 0 if `v` is not 'D'; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character in `votes`**
