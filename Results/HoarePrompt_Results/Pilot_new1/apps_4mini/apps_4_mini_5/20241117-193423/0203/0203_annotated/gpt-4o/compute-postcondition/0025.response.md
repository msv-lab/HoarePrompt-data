The code appends the value `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous state indicates that `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue` which has been removed. The value of `n` is not provided, but it is assumed to be a numeric value. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is updated (first element removed), `d_index` is the popped index from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue` which is removed, and `r_queue` is updated with the value `r_index + n`.**
