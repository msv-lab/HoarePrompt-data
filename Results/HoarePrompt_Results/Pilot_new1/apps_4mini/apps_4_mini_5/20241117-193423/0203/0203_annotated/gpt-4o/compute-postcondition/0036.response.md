The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The variables `d_index` and `n` are used to compute the new value that will be added to `d_queue`. The state of `d_queue` changes as an element is added, while `d_index` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `d_queue` has one more element (the value `d_index + n` appended), `r_index` is now the first element of the original `r_queue`**
