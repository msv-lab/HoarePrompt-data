Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (which is not explicitly passed as a parameter but is read from input) and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. If the count of 'D' (depublicans) is greater than the count of 'R' (remocrats), it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not handle cases where `fractions` is empty, which could lead to incorrect behavior or an error. **
