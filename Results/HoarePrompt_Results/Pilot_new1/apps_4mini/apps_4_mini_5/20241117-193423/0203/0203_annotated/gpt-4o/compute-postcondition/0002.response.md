The variable `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `votes` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `d_queue` is an empty list.
