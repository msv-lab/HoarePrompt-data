According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `fractions`. Since `fractions` is a non-empty string, it has at least one character. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` has been processed up to the last character. To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state based on the next character in the string `fractions`.

1. The variable `fraction` will need to refer to the next character in the string. If `fractions` has a length of `n`, the loop will execute `n` times, and after the last iteration, `fraction` will have been the last character.
2. Since `fractions` is non-empty, we can assume it has at least one character. To execute the loop one more time, we would need to ensure that there is still another character left to process.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to indicate that `fractions` must have at least one more character left, and we can represent this by adjusting the state to reflect the next character.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `fraction` is the next character in the string**.
