Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains the value 1 if `v` is 'D', resulting in either [0, 1] or [1], while `r_queue` remains empty. If `v` is not 'D', `d_queue` remains [0] or empty, and `r_queue` contains the value 1 or [0, 1]. In both cases, `i` is 1, and `v` is the second character in `votes`.***
