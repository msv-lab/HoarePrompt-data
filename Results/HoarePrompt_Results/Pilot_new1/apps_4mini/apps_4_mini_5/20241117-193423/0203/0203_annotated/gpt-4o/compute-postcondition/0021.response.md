The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` is not affected by this operation, so we only need to reflect the change in `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`. 

Since the initial state mentions that `d_queue` is updated (first element removed), we assume `r_queue` is also being manipulated, but its previous state is not provided. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, and we acknowledge that `r_queue` has been modified.

Output State: **`d_queue` is updated (first element removed), `d_index` is the popped index from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue` which is removed.**
