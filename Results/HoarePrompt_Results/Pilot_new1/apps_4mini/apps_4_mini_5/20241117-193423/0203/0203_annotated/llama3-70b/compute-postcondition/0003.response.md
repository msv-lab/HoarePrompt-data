The variable `remocrats` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (a positive integer), `fractions` (a string input by the user), and `depublicans` (which is `0`). The assignment does not change the state of these variables. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string input by the user, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string input by the user, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
