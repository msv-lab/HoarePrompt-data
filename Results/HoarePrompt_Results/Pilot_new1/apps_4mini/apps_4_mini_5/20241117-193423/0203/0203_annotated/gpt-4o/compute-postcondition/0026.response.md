Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is updated with the first element removed, `d_index` is the popped index from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue` which is removed. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` now includes `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is updated with the value `r_index + n`. This ensures that both queues are modified appropriately based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`, handling cases where they may be equal or when either queue is empty prior to the operation.***
