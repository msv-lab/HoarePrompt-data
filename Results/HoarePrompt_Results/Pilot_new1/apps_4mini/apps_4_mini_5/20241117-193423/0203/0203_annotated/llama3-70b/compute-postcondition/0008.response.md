The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is 0, so after execution, `remocrats` becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `depublicans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, and `fractions` is not equal to 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, and `fractions` is not equal to 'D'**
