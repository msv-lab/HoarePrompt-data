The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The current value of `i` is 0, so `d_queue` will now contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within 1 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is now [0]; `r_queue` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `v` is 'D'.
