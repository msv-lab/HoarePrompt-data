Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `n` is the total number of characters in `fractions`. If `fractions` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute exactly `n` times, counting each character in `fractions`.**
