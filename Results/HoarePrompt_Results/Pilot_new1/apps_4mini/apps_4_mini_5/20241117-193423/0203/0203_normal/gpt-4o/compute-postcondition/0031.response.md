The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The values of `r_index` and `n` are unchanged, while `r_queue` is modified to include this new element. Since `d_queue` and `d_index` are not affected by this operation, the output state includes the updated state of `r_queue` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element plus the new element `r_index + n`, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `n` remains unchanged**
