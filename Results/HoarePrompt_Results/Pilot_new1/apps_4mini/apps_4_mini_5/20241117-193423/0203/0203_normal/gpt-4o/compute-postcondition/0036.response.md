The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous value of `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `n` is an integer that is added to it. The state of `d_queue` will change by adding a new element, while `r_queue` and its related variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (the value of `d_index + n`), `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` is now one element shorter, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`.**
