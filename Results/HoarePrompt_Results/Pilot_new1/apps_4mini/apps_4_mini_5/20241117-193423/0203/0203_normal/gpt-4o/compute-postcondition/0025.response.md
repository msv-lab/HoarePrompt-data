The code appends the value `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The variable `r_index` holds the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `n` is an unknown value. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `r_queue` and retains the previous values of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_queue` now includes the value `r_index + n`.**
