The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and the parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' in the `votes` string. 

The functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `votes`, and return a result based on the voting characters in the string.
