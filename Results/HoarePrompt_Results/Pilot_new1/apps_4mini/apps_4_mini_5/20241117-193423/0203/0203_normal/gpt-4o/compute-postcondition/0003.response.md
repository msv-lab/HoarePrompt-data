The variable `r_queue` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of the other variables (`n`, `votes`, and `d_queue`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer within 1 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.
