Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `n` is the total number of characters in `fractions`. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, if `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, 'R' is printed. If `fractions` is an empty string, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0, and thus 'R' is printed as well.***
