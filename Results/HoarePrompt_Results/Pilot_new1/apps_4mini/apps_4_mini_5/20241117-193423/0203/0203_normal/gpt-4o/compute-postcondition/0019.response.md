Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`. If `n` is 1, the loop executes at least once, and either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will contain the index 0, depending on whether the first character is 'D' or 'R'. If `n` is 0 (not possible in this case since `n` is within 1 to 200,000), the loop would not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` would remain empty.**
