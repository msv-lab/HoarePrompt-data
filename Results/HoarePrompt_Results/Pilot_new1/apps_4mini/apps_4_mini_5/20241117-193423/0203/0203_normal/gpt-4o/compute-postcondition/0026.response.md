Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one less element, and if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has an additional element equal to `d_index + n`. Otherwise, if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` has an additional element equal to `r_index + n`. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` remain unchanged as they represent the values at the front of their respective queues before the pop operation.***
