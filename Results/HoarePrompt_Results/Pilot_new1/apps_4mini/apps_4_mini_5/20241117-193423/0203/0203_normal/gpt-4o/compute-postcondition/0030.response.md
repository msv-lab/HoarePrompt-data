The `d_queue` has one less element, and `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`. The code appends the value `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the new element being added to `d_queue` is calculated as `d_index + n`. The other variables (`d_index`, `r_queue`, `r_index`, and `n`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element with the value `d_index + n`, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `n` remains unchanged**.
