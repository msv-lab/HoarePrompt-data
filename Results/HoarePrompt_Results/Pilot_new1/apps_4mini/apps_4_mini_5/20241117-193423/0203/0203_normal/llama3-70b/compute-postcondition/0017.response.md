Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with at least 1 character remaining. If the second character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the second character is 'R', then `remocrats` is increased by 1.***
