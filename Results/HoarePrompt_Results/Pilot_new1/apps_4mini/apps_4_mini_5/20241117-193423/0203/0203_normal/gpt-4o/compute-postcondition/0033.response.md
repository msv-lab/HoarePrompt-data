According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `d_queue` and `r_queue`. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `d_queue` and `r_queue` each have one less element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to have at least one element each. Since they both had one less element at the end of the last iteration, they must each have had at least one element before the last iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` currently have at least one element.

State: **`d_queue` has at least 1 element, `r_queue` has at least 1 element**
