Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `a`, `b` are positive integers; `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated floor values; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; the output is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
