The function accepts an integer `apartment`, representing an apartment number, and calculates the corresponding `block` and `floor` based on predefined values `m` and `k`. It returns a tuple containing `block` and `floor`. However, the function assumes that `m` and `k` are defined elsewhere in the code, which could lead to potential errors if they are not set. Additionally, there are no checks for invalid apartment numbers (such as negative values), which could also result in incorrect calculations.
