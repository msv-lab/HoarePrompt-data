To calculate the value of `floor_within_block`, we need to determine the value of `apartment`. However, since `apartment` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot compute the exact value of `floor_within_block`. Therefore, we can only describe the impact of the code.

The code calculates `floor_within_block` as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, which means it will yield a value based on the current value of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1 based on the value of `apartment`; `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
