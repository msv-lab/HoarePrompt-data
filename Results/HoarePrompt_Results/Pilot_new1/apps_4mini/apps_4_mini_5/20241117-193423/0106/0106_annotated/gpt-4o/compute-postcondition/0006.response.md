Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer representing an apartment number within the range 1 to n·m·k; `b` is a distinct integer; `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are assigned based on the functions get_location(a) and get_location(b). If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. If `floor_a` is greater than 1, then `time_to_exit` is at least 11, specifically calculated as 10 plus the number of floors above the first floor (i.e., `time_to_exit` is at least 10 + (floor_a - 1)).***
