The variable `min_floor_time` is calculated using the formula `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. The values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are known, with `a_floor` being greater than `b_floor`. However, since `b_floor` is undefined, this calculation cannot be performed. Therefore, the output state reflects that `min_floor_time` cannot be computed due to the undefined variable.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `a` is an integer; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `b_block` is undefined; min_floor_time cannot be computed due to undefined `b_floor`.**
