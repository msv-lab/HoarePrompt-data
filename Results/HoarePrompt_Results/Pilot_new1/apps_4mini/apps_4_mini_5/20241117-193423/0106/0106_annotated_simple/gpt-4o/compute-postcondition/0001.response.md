The variable `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`. The value of `apartment` is not explicitly provided, but it is assumed to be a positive integer within the range defined by the product of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

The calculation for `floor_within_block` takes the value of `apartment`, subtracts 1, and then computes the remainder when this value is divided by the product of `m` and `k`. This results in `floor_within_block`, which represents the position of the apartment within its block.

Since the specific values of `apartment`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, the output state can only reflect that `floor_within_block` is assigned based on the formula provided.

Output State: **`floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
