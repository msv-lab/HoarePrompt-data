To evaluate the impact of the code on the program, we need to analyze the equation provided.

1. The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the value of the expression `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
2. The initial state indicates that `direct_walk_time` is calculated using the formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, but we do not have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`.
3. The calculation for `reverse_walk_time` depends on the same variables (`block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`), but it uses a different formula.

Since we do not know the specific values of `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values for `reverse_walk_time`. However, we can state the relationship and the new variable introduced.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship between the variables and the new calculation.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
