The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, `k` and two integers `a` and `b`, representing locations in a multi-block structure. It calculates the total time to exit from location `a` to location `b`, considering the time to exit the floor, the walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The total time is computed as the sum of the time to exit, the minimum walking time (either direct or reverse), and the time to reach the target floor. The function does not handle cases where `get_location(a)` or `get_location(b)` may return invalid values.
