The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, and the value of `x` minus `b` is divisible by `balance`, and the quotient of `(x - b)` divided by `balance` is a non-negative integer; `count` is increased by 1.
