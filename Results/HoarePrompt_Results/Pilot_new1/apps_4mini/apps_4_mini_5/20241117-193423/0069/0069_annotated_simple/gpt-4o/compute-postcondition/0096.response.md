The `results` list is appended with the value `-1`. The `prefix_balances` variable is not affected by this operation, and its previous state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the `results` list while maintaining the state of other variables.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to index `i`; the balance is equal to 0; `results` now includes -1.**
