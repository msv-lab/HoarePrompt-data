Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, and `prefix_balances[1]` is updated to `prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[0] == '0' else -1)`**
