According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances`. If the list contains at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` contains at least 3 elements, `count` is 1, and `balance` is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `prefix_balances` has at least 4 elements, and `b` needs to be the fourth element in the list.

State: **`prefix_balances` contains at least 4 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1, `b` is the fourth element in `prefix_balances`**
