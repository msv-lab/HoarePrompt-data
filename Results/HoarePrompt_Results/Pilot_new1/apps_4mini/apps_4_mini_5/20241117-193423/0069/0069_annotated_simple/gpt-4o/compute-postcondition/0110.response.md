The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length at least `n + 2`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `b` is the next element in the list after the current `b`; `count` is increased by 1.
