Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1; if `x` is not found, `results` includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative, and `results` includes this `count`. This accounts for all cases, including when `n` is 0 or less, where `prefix_balances` remains as a list of zeros with length 1.***
