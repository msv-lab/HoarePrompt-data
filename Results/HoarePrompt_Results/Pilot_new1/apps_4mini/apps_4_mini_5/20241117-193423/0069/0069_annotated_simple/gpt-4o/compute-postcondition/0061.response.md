The code appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The initial state of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remains unchanged. The `results` list is updated by adding `0`, but the values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged, and `results` now includes an additional element `0`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged, and `results` now includes an additional element `0**.
