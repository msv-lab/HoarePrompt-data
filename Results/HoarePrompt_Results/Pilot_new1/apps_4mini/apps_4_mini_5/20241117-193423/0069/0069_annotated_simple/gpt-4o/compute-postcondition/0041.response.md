Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the prefix sums calculated from `s`, and `balance` is an integer. If `balance` is 0, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` is appended to `results`. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then `0` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated based on the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. In the case where `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and the results will reflect the conditions based on the values of `balance` and `x`.***
