Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`. If `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`. Otherwise, `0` is appended to `results`, indicating that `x` is not found in the cumulative balances.***
