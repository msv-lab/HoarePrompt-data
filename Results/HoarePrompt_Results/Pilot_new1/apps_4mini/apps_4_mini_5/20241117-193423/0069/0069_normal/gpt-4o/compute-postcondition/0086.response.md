According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, as it iterates from 1 to `n + 1`. The initial state indicates that `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, which is consistent with the loop's requirements. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and we also need to set the initial value of `i` to 1, as that is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
