The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The previous state indicates that `index` is 1, so `data[index + 2]` refers to `data[3]`. The variable `n` is an input positive integer, and `s` is a binary string of length `n`. The state of `T` and `results` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list**
