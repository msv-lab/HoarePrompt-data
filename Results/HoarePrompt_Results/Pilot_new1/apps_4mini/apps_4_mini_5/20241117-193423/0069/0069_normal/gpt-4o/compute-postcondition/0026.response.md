Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains cumulative balances of '0's and '1's, where the last balance is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` has a length of `n + 1`, and the last element represents a non-zero balance. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of length 1 filled with zeros.***
