Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `x` does not equal `balance`, it would lead to a division by zero, which must be handled appropriately. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that the division is valid and `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`. All edge cases are considered, particularly those concerning the balance and the counts of '0's and '1's.***
