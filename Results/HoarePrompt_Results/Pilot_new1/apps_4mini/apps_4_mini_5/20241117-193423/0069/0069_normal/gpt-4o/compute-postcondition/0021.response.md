Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to each index in `s` results in a total balance of 0, indicating that the number of '0's counted is equal to the number of '1's counted up to the index considered. The variable `x` is an element that exists within `prefix_balances`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, and `balance` is 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros, and `balance` is 0.***
