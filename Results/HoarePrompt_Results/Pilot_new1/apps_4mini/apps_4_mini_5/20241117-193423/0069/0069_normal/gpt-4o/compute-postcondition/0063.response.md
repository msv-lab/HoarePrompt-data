Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's is not equal to 0, meaning that the total count of '0's is either greater or less than the total count of '1's. If `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` has been updated based on the string `s`, and if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros.***
