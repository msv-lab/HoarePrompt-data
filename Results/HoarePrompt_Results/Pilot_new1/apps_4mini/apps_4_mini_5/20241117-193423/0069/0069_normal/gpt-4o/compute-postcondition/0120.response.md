According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one element, which means there is at least one more element left to iterate over. However, since the loop has already processed one element, we need to adjust the state to reflect that one element has been consumed.

To execute one more time, the loop must now point to the next element in the `results` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` still contains at least one element, and we need to adjust the state to indicate that the next `result` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`results` contains at least two elements, `T` is greater than 0, and the function prints the second element of `results`.**
