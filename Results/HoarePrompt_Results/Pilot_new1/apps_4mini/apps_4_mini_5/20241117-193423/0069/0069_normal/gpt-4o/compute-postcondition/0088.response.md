According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, meaning it can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it ensures that the loop can continue executing. 

The condition for `prefix_balances[i]` being either 1 or -1 does not need to be adjusted, as it will be checked in the next iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1**
