Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which indicates the number of adjustments needed to achieve the balance with respect to `x`. This ensures all cases regarding the relationship between `balance`, `x`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1` are handled, including edge cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to potential division by zero.***
