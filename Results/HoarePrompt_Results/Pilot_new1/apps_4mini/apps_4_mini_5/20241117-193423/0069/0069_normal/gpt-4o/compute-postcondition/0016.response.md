According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and continues until `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value, which would be `n` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1` and since `n` is the upper limit, it must be ensured that `n` is at least 1 for this to be valid. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now `n + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[n]` and the value of `s[n - 1]`, `i` is n + 1**
