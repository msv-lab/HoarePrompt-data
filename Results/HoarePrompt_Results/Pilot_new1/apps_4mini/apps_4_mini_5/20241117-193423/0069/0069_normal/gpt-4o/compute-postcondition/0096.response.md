The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The state of `prefix_balances` and `x` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, and `results` is updated to include `-1`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, and `results` is updated to include -1.**
