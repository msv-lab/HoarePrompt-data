Postcondition: ***`n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `cnt0 - cnt1` is not equal to 0 and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which accounts for the case when `cnt0 - cnt1` is not zero and ensures that the output is correctly calculated based on the values of `x` and `balance`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the behavior of the program is not specified in the provided fragment, which is a potential edge case to consider.***
