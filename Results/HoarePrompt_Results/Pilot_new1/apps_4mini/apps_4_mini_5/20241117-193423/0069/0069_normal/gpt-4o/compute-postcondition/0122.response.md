According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If `results` contains at least three elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least two elements, and the loop has printed the second element of `results`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must contain at least three elements, and `result` should be the third element in the list. 

State: **`results` contains at least three elements, `T` is greater than 0, `result` is the third element of `results`**
