The variable `prefix_balances` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is determined from the previous state. Other variables (`results`, `T`, `x`, `s`, `index`, and `balance`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `prefix_balances` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros**
