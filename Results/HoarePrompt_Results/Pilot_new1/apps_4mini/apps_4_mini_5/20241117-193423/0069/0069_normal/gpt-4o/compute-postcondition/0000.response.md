The code snippet provided does not alter any variables or states; it simply reads input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged as no assignment or modification occurs. Therefore, the output state remains as it was initially defined.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'**.
