The code prints the value of `n + 1`. The variable `n` is a positive integer, so `n + 1` will also be a positive integer. The other variables (`x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, and the function prints `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and the function prints `n + 1`**
