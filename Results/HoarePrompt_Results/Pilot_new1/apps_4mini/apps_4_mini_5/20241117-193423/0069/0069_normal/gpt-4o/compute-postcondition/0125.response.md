Output State: **If `T` is greater than 0, `results` contains the outcomes of the analysis, and the loop executes `T` times, printing each element in `results`. If `T` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1; if `balance` is 0 and `x` is not found, `results` contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` contains counts based on the specified conditions, and `prefix_balances` is populated accordingly.**
