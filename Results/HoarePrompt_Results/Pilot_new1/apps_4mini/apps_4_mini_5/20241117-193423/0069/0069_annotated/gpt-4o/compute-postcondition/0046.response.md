The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The other variables `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `results`, `count`, and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3**
