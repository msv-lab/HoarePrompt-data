Output State: **`count` is the number of indices `i` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - prefix_balances[i])` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`; if `prefix_balances` is empty, `count` remains 0; if `balance` is 0, the loop is designed to handle the division by zero error, and `results` now includes `count`.**
