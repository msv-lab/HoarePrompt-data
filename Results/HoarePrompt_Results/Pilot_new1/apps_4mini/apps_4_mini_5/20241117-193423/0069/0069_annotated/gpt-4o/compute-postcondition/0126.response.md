The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a series of test cases where for each test case, it will process the following inputs: 

- `T`: a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: a positive integer representing the length of the binary string `s`.
  - `x`: an integer which can range from -10^9 to 10^9.
  - `s`: a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s`, but the specific return value is not defined.**
