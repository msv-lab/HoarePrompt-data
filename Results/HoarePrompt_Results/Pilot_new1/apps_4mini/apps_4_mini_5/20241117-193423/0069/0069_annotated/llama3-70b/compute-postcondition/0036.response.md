Output State: **If T is greater than 0, then for each iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the code avoids division by zero; thus, if `balance` equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`, otherwise it prints -1. If `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is not zero, and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If T is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is produced.**
