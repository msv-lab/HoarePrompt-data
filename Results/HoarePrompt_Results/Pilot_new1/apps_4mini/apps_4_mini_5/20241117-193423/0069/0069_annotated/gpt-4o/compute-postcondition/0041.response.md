Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, and `balance` is the net difference between the counts of '0's and '1's. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1; if `x` is not present, `results` includes an additional 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of valid indices in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. In cases where `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, and the loop does not execute.***
