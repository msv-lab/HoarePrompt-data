The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer from `data[0]`, `n` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, and `index` is 1.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer from `data[0]`, `n` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, and `index` is 1**
