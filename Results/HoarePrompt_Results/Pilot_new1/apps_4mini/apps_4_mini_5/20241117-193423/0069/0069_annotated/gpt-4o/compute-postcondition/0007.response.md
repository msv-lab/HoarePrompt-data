The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is 0, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[1]`. The value of `data[1]` is not specified, but `x` will now hold the integer value of that element. The other variables `T`, `n`, `s`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is assigned the value of the first element in `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is unchanged, `index` is 0, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is assigned the value of the first element in `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is unchanged, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
