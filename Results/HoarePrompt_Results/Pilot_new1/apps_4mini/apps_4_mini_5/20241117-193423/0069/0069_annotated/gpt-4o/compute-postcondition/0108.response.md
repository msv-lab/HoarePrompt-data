Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0 initially. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1, indicating that the condition was satisfied. If the condition is not met, `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
