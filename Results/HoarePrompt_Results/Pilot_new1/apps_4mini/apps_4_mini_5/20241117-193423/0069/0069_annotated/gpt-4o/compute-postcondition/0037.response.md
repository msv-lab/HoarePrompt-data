Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` (all elements are zeros), `balance` is not equal to 0, `b` is 0, and `x` is an integer. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `(x - b) % balance` is not equal to 0 or `(x - b) // balance` is negative, `count` remains unchanged.***
