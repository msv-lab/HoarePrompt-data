The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This indicates that `min_wait_time` is initialized to a value that is greater than any finite number, which is useful for comparison purposes later in the program. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, and `min_wait_time` is float('inf')**
