The code appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` already contains some tuples, and the values of `s` and `d` are provided as input positive integers. The state of `buses` will change to include the new tuple.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated contents of `buses`, which now includes the previously existing tuples plus the new tuple `(s, d)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is 2, `s` is an input positive integer, `d` is an input positive integer, and `buses` now contains the previous tuples plus the tuple `(s, d)`**
