The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are defined from `bus_routes[i]`, and since `n` is greater than `i + 1`, it guarantees that `i` is within valid bounds. The specific values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are not provided, but we know they are defined. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `wait_time` is calculated based on the given formula, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
