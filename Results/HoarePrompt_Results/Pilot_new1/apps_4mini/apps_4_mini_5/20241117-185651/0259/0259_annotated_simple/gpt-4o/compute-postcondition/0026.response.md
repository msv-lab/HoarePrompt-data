Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, no changes are made to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`.***
