Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and if `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is non-negative as long as `d_i` is positive.***
