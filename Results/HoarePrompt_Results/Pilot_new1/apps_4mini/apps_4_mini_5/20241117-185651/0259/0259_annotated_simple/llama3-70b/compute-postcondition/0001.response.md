The variable `buses` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged and are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n` and `t` as well as the initialization of `buses`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `buses` is an empty list.**
