The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is a known variable and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, it indicates that `i + 1` is a valid index for the routes. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `min_wait_time`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1**
