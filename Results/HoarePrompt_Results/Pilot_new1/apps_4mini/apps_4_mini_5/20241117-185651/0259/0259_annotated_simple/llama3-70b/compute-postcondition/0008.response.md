According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `_` is now 2 and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is 2, `s` is an input positive integer, `d` is an input positive integer, and `buses` now contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
