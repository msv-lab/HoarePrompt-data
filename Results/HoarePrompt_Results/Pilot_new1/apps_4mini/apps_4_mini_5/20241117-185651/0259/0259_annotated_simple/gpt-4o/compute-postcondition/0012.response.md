Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, and `i` is 0. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, if `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i)` is not divisible by `d_i`, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is always a non-negative integer. This covers all scenarios based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`, as well as the divisibility condition with `d_i`.***
