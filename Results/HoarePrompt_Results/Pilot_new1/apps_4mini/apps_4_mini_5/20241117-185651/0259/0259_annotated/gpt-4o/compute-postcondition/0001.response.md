The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, and `min_wait_time`, while `chosen_route` is now set to `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), and `chosen_route` is -1**
