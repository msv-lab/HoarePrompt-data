Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This ensures that `wait_time` is always a non-negative integer that accounts for any remainder when `t` is not aligned with the bus schedule.***
