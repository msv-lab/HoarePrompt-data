Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 2 tuples, `i` is 2, `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`, and `time` is assigned the value of `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 3; otherwise, `min_time` remains unchanged and `ans` remains 2.***
