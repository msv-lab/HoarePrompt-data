According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), we can determine the conditions for the loop to execute again. 

If `i` is currently less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute one more time, meaning `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. If `i` is currently equal to `n - 1`, then the loop will not execute again, as `i` will reach `n` in the next iteration.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1`. Thus, we can adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now `n - 1` (the last index before it would exceed `n`), and we need to ensure that `n` remains unchanged since it is a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is less than `n - 1`**
