The variable `ans` is assigned the value of -1. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The state of the other variables remains the same: `buses` contains `n` tuples of (s, d), `_` is `n-1`, and `min_time` is float('inf'). Therefore, the output state is: `buses` contains `n` tuples of (s, d), `_` is `n-1`, `min_time` is float('inf'), and `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` contains `n` tuples of (s, d), `_` is n-1, `min_time` is float('inf'), and `ans` is -1**
