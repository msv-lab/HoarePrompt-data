The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so the value of `chosen_route` will be one more than whatever `i` was. The state of `min_wait_time` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
