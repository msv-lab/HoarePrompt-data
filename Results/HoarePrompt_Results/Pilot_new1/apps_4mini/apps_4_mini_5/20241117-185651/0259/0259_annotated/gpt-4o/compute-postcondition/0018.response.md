The code assigns the values from the `bus_routes` list at index `i` (which is 2) to `s_i` and `d_i`. The initial state indicates that `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` will depend on the specific tuple located at index 2 in the `bus_routes` list. The values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[2]**
