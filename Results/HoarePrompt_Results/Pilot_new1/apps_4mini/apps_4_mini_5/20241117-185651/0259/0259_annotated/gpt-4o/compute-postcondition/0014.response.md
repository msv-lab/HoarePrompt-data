The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The initial state indicates that `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, but the exact values are not specified. Therefore, after the assignment, `min_wait_time` will now equal `wait_time`, which is a value less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are the first tuple from `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.**
