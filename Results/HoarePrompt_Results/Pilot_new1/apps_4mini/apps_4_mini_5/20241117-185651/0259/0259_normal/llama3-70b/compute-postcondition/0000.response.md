The values of `n` and `t` are assigned using `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input, splits it, and converts the split values into integers. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), the output state reflects that `n` and `t` are now set to the values provided via input. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000)**
