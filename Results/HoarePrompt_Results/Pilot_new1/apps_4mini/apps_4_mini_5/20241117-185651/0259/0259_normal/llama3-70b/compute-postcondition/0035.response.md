Functionality: ** The function accepts user input for the number of buses `n` and a time `t`, followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the start time `s` and the duration `d` of each bus. It calculates the minimum time until the next bus departs based on the formula `(t - s) % d` and returns the 1-based index of the bus with the minimum wait time. If there are no buses (when `n` is 0), it will output `-1`. **
