Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, with `s_i` and `d_i` assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `n + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then both `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This ensures that all scenarios regarding the relationship between `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are addressed, including cases where `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, 0, or `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
