The code appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The variable `buses` previously held a list of tuples, and after this operation, it will include an additional tuple. The values of `n`, `t`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list of buses.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is now [(s, d), (s, d), (s, d)], and `s`, `d` are input integers**
