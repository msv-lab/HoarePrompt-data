Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, an integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, where each tuple contains the start time `s_i` and the interval `d_i` for each bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for the buses based on their schedules and returns the 1-based index of the bus route that has the shortest wait time. If there are no valid routes (i.e., all bus routes have start times less than `t` and cannot be reached), it returns -1. Additionally, if `n` is 0, indicating no bus routes are provided, it also returns -1. **
