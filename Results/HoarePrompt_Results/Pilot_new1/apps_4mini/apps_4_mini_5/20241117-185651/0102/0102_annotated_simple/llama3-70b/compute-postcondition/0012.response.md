Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the corresponding string representation from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding string representation from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation of `s` in words by combining the appropriate entry from the `tens` list with the `ones` list, including a hyphen if `s` is not a multiple of 10. This covers all values of `s`, including edge cases at 10, 19, and multiples of 10.***
