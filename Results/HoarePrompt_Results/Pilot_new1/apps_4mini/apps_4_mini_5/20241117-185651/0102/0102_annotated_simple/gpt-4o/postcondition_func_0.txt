The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English string representation if `n` is between 0 and 99 inclusive. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, it returns the string formatted as "tens-ones" for numbers that are not multiples of 10, or just the string representation of the tens place for multiples of 10. If `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not return any value. Additionally, the function does not handle the case when `n` is exactly 10, which is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations.
