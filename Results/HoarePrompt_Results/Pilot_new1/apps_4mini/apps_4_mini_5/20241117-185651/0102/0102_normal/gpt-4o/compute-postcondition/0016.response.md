Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is equal to 10 or a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string representation of `n` in the format of 'tens' followed by '-' and 'ones', ensuring that all valid integers from 10 to 99 are correctly represented.***
