The function accepts an integer input from the user and prints its English word representation for numbers between 0 and 99. If the input is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. For inputs between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For inputs 20 and above, it combines the appropriate word from the `tens` list with the word from the `ones` list (if applicable) using a hyphen. The function does not handle inputs outside the range of 0-99, nor does it return any value; it only prints the output.
