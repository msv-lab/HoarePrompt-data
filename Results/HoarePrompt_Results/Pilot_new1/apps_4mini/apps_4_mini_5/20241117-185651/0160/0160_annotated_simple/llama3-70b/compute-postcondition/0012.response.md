According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `gcd`. The loop will execute if `gcd` is at least 1 because the range starts from 1. The loop iterates from 1 to the integer value of the square root of `gcd`, which means that if `gcd` is 0, the loop will not execute. 

Given that `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, it is also necessary for `max_divisor` to be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `gcd` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1**
