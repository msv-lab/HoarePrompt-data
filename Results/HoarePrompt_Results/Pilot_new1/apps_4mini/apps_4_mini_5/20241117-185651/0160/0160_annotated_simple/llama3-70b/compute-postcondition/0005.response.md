According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `N` is at least 2, the condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(gcd, A[1]), `i` is 2**
