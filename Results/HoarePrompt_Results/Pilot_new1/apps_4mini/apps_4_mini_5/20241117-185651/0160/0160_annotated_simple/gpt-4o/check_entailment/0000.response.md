To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and implementation of the code.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to manipulate a sequence of integers using a limited number of operations (up to K times) to maximize the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the resulting sequence. The operations allow us to add 1 to one element and subtract 1 from another.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:

1. **`func_1(lst)`**: This function computes the GCD of the list of integers.
   - It iterates through the list and uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the GCD of all elements.
   - The final result is the GCD of the entire list.

2. **`func_2(x)`**: This function finds and returns the divisors of a number `x` in descending order.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x` to find all divisors and returns them sorted.

### Missing Logic
The provided program does not appear to implement the logic required to handle the operations as described in the problem. Specifically:
- The program does not account for how the operations (adding 1 to one element and subtracting 1 from another) can affect the GCD of the list.
- The maximum positive integer that divides every element after performing the operations is not calculated. The code only computes the GCD of the original list without considering the possible adjustments allowed by K operations.

### Example of Failure
Consider the input:
```
2 3
8 20
```
- The expected output is `7`, as we can perform operations to reach a state where both numbers can be made to have a GCD of 7.
- However, the program will just compute the GCD of `8` and `20`, which is `4`, and will not consider that we can change the numbers to achieve a higher GCD.

### Conclusion
The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it does not implement the necessary logic to account for the allowed operations and their impact on the GCD. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
