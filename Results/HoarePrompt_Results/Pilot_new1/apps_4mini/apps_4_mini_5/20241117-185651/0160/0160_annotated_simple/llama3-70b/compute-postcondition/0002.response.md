The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, which is the first element of the list `A`. The value of `A[0]` is not specified in the initial state but is an integer from the list of `N` integers populated from input. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, and `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, and `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`**
