The value of `max_divisor` is updated by taking the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd` or increases if `i` is greater than `gcd`. Given that `i` is 1 and `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` will not decrease. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_divisor` remains unchanged, and other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1**
