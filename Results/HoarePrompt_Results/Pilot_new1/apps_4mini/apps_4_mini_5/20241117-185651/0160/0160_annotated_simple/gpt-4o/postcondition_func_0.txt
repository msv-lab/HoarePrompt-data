The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. If the list contains fewer than two elements, it returns the first element as the GCD. However, if the list is empty, this will raise an IndexError since it attempts to access `lst[0]`. Therefore, the function does not handle the case of an empty list properly.
