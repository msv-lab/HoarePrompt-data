Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `gcd` is not a perfect square, `max_divisor` may also be updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `gcd` is a perfect square, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
