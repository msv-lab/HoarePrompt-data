Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` found during the loop execution. If `x` is a perfect square, then `i` will equal the square root of `x`, and `divisors` will include `i` only once. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains empty. If `x` is equal to 1, the loop will execute once, adding 1 to `divisors`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will execute at least once and may add multiple divisors to the set depending on the divisibility conditions.**
