The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, but the code `divisors.add(x // i)` will add the value of `x // i` to the `divisors` set. The variable `i` is 2, so `x // i` will be equal to `x // 2`. Since `divisors` initially contains 2, after executing the code, the value of `x // 2` will be added to `divisors` as long as it is not already present.

Thus, the output state is dependent on the value of `x`, but since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we can only state that `divisors` will have an additional value added based on the result of `x // 2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` contains 2 and `x // 2` is added to `divisors`**.
