The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is an integer, and it is expected to be derived from the constraints where `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, and `A` is a list of N integers where each A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6. After executing the function body, it returns the sorted list of divisors of `x` in descending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` and return its divisors sorted in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns the sorted list of divisors of x in descending order.**
