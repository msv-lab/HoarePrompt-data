According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the upper limit of `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. 

If `gcd` is greater than 1, the value of `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will also be greater than 1, which means that `i` can be incremented to 2. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 2.

State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 2**
