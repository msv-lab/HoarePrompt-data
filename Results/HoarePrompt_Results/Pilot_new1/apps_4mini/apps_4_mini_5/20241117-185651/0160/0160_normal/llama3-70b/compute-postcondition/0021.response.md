The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. Since `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or 2, we need to compare that with `gcd // i`, where `i` is 2. 

If `gcd` is greater than 2, then `gcd // 2` will be less than or equal to `gcd`, so the maximum will remain `gcd`. If `gcd` is less than or equal to 2, then `gcd // 2` will be 1 or 0, and `max_divisor` will be updated to 2, since 2 is greater than `gcd // 2`.

Therefore, the output state is dependent on the value of `gcd`. 

Output State: **`max_divisor` is either `gcd` or 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to max(`max_divisor`, `gcd // 2`)**
