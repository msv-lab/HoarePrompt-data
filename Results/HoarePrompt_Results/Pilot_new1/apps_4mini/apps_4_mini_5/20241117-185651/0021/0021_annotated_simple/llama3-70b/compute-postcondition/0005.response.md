To determine the output state based on the provided initial state and code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code:

1. The code assigns the value of `min_dist` as the minimum of two values: `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.
2. The value of `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`, and `posn` is the index of `n` in the same list.
3. The variables `n`, `pos1`, and `posn` are already defined in the initial state.

Since the exact values of `pos1` and `posn` are not provided, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculation of `min_dist` based on the absolute difference between the positions of `1` and `n`, adjusted by `-1`, and compared to `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `min_dist` is computed as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
