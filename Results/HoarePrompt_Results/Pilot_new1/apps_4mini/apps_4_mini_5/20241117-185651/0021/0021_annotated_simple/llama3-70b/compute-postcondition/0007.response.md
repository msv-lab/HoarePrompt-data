The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. After executing the function body, the function performs operations based on these inputs. However, the specific output of the function is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value without additional information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each integer in the range from 1 to n).**
