The code assigns the value of `pos1` to the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input, and it is given that `n` is at least 2, it can be inferred that `1` must be present in the list `a`. Therefore, `pos1` will be the index of the value `1` in `a`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a**.
