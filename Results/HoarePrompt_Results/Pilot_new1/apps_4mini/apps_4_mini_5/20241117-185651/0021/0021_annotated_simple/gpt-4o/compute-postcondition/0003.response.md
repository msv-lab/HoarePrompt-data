The code assigns `max_pos` the value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer in the range from 2 to 100 and `a` is a list of distinct integers, we can infer that the index of `n` in `a` will be determined based on its position within that list. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not directly affected, and `min_pos` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the current values of `n`, `a`, and the newly assigned `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`**
