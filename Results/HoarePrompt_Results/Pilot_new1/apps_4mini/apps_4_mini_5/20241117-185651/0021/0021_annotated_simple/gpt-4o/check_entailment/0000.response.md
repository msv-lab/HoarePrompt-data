To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**:
   - An integer `n` which represents the size of the permutation.
   - A list `a` of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`.

2. **Output**:
   - A single integer representing the maximum distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) after performing exactly one swap.

### Code Review
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_pos = a.index(1)  # Position of minimum element (1)
    max_pos = a.index(n)  # Position of maximum element (n)

    # Calculate distances to the ends of the array
    dist1 = abs(0 - max_pos)  # Distance from max to the start
    dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)  # Distance from max to the end
    dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)  # Distance from min to the start
    dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)  # Distance from min to the end

    # Determine the maximum distance possible after one swap
    max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)
    print(max_distance)
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. The code correctly identifies the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array.
2. It calculates the distances of these elements to both ends of the array (index 0 and index n-1).
3. The program then finds the maximum of these distances, which is intended to represent the maximum distance achievable by one swap.

### Potential Issues
- The code does not explicitly check if a swap is necessary or if it would even change the positions of the minimum and maximum elements. For example:
  - If the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the array, the code will still compute a distance based on the calculated distances without considering that no effective swap could increase the distance.
  
### Test Cases
- **Case 1**: Input: `5`, `4 5 1 3 2` 
  - Expected Output: `3` (correctly calculated).
  
- **Case 2**: Input: `7`, `1 6 5 3 4 7 2` 
  - Expected Output: `6` (correctly calculated).

- **Case 3**: Input: `6`, `6 5 4 3 2 1` 
  - Expected Output: `5` (correctly calculated).

- **Edge Case**: Input: `2`, `1 2`
  - Here, the minimum and maximum are already at the ends, and swapping does not change their positions. The output should be `1` (the distance between them), but the code would output `1` as well, which is correct but does not reflect the need for a swap.

### Conclusion
The program is not correctly addressing the requirement that it should perform exactly one swap. For the case where the minimum and maximum are already at the ends, it would still return a distance as if a swap were made, which is misleading. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
