To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the impact of the assignment `dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)` on the existing variables.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input.
   - `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`.
   - `dist1` is `max_pos`.
   - `dist2` is calculated as `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.
   - `dist3` is `abs(0 - min_pos)`.

2. **Calculation of `dist4`**:
   - The variable `min_pos` is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is presumably the index of the minimum value in the list `a`.
   - The calculation of `dist4` involves the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`.

3. **Output State**:
   - After executing the code, `dist4` is assigned the value `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.
   - The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state will reflect the values of `n`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and the newly calculated `dist4`. Since `min_pos` is not defined, we will mention it as part of the output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos); `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos)**.
