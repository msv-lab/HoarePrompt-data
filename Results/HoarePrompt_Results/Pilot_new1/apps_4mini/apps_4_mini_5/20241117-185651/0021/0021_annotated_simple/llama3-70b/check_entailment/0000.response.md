To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Understanding the Code

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the permutation.
   - It then reads a list `a` of `n` distinct integers that forms a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

2. **Finding Positions**:
   - `pos1` stores the index of the minimum element (1).
   - `posn` stores the index of the maximum element (n).

3. **Calculating Distances**:
   - `max_dist` is calculated as the maximum distance between the positions of the minimum and maximum elements minus 1 (which seems incorrect as it should just be the absolute distance).
   - `min_dist` is calculated similarly but as the minimum distance.
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

### Logical Flaws

The main issue is with how the distances are calculated and what is being printed. The goal is to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap.

1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires finding the maximum distance after performing one swap, but the current logic does not correctly account for the possible swaps.
   - The program does not check the possible positions to swap 1 and n to achieve maximum distance.

2. **Not Considering All Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the list, and a swap would not change their positions effectively. It should directly return the distance as `n - 1` in such cases.

### Test Cases

Let's consider a specific test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  4
  1 2 3 4
  ```
  Here, 1 is at index 0 and 4 is at index 3. The distance is already maximum (3). The program should return `3`, but it may not handle it correctly based on the flawed logic.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap. Therefore, it is not correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
