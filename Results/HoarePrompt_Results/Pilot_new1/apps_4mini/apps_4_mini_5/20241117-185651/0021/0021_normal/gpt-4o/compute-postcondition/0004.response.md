The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The value of `max_pos` is previously defined as the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Since `max_pos` is an index, it must be a non-negative integer. Thus, the value of `dist1` will be equal to `max_pos`, as `abs(0 - max_pos)` simplifies to `max_pos`. 

The output state does not change any of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist1` is equal to `max_pos**
