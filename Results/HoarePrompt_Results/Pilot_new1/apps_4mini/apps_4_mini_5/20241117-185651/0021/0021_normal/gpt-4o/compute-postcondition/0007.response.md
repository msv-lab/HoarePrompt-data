The variable `dist4` is assigned the value `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The values of `n` and `min_pos` are needed to determine the exact value of `dist4`, but since `min_pos` is unknown, we cannot compute a specific value for `dist4`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the known variables and the relationship involving `dist4`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos), `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos), and `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos)**.
