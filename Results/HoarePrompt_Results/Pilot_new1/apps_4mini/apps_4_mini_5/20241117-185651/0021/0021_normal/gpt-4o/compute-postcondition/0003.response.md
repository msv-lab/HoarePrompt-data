The code assigns `max_pos` the value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), we need to check if `n` exists in the list `a`. If it does, `max_pos` will hold the index of its first occurrence; if it does not exist, this will raise a ValueError. However, since the problem does not specify that `n` is guaranteed to be in `a`, we cannot assume a valid index will be assigned. Therefore, the output state will reflect the uncertainty of `max_pos` and the unchanged state of other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a` if `n` is in `a`, otherwise an error occurs.**
