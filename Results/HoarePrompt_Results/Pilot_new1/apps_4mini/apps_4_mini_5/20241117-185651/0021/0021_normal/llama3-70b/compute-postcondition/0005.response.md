To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet based on the initial state.

1. The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of the minimum between two expressions: `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.
2. We know that `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`, and `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the same list. The values of `pos1` and `posn` will influence the calculation of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`.
3. The expression `n - 2` is straightforward, as it simply subtracts `2` from `n`.

We need to compute `min_dist` based on these values. Importantly, since the exact values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are not specified, we can only describe the relationship.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `pos1`, `posn`, and the computed `min_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from user input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
