To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables. 

1. `max_dist` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot calculate `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)` without knowing `max_dist`.
2. `min_dist` is defined as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, but we need the values of `pos1` and `posn` to calculate it.
3. The operation `print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))` will output the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. However, since we don't have the value of `max_dist`, we cannot determine the output.

Since the values of `max_dist`, `pos1`, and `posn` are not defined, we cannot compute the output state accurately.

Output State: **`max_dist` is undefined, `pos1` is undefined, `posn` is undefined, and the output cannot be computed.**
