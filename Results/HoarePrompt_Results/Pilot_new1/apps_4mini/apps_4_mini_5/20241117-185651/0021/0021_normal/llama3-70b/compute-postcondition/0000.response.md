The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, so after executing this line, `n` will still satisfy this condition. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100**
