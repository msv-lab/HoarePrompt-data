The variable `dist4` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The values of `n` and `min_pos` are already defined in the initial state. The calculation for `dist4` depends on these values. Therefore, `dist4` will hold the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`.

The output state will reflect the values of all affected variables. Since `dist4` is newly calculated, we include it in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`, `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`**
