The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). Additionally, it accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is within the range from 1 to `n`. 

The function does not have any specified output in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot describe the return value based on the output details given. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and n). The specific return value is not provided.**
