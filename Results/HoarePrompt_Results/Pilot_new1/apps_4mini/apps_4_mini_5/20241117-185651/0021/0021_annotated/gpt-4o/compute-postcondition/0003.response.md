The variable `max_pos` is assigned the index of the value `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an input integer and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the index of `n` in `a` will be a specific integer value based on the contents of the list. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `min_pos` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `n`, `a`, and the newly assigned `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.**
