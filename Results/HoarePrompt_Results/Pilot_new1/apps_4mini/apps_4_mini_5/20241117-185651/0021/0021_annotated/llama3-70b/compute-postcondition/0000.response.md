The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input and `int` converts it to that integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100, but the specific value of `n` after the input is not known. The list `a` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` as an input integer while maintaining the conditions of the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to n.**
