The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will contain a list of integers obtained from user input. The input will be a space-separated string of integers, which will be converted to a list of integers. Since `a` is specified to be a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`, it will contain exactly `n` distinct integers from that range.

The output state is dependent on the input provided, but we can state that `a` will now hold a list of integers that are distinct and within the range of 1 to `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to n based on input.**
