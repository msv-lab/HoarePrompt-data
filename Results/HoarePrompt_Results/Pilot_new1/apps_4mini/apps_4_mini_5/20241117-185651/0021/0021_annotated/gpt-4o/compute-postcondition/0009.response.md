Output State: **`n` is updated to the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`, `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`, and `max_distance` is equal to the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The value of `max_distance` is printed.**
