The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It increments `n` until it becomes a multiple of 10, and then prints the resulting value of `n`. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it remains unchanged. The function does not handle any invalid input cases or provide any output other than the modified value of `n`.
