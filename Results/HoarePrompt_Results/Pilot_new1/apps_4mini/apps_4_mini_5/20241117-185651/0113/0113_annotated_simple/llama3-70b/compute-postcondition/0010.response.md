The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined with empty parentheses. However, it operates based on the constraints provided: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). 

Since the output is not specified in the prompt, we can only assume that the function will return some value based on these constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 8) and performs operations accordingly, though the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
