The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`. The variable `k` can take on values from 0 to 8, which means `multiplier` can be any power of 10 from `1` (when `k` is `0`) to `100000000` (when `k` is `8`). The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `multiplier` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `multiplier` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.**
