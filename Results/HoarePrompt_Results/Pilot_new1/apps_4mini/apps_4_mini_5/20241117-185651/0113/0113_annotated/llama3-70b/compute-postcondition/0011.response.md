Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates `x` as \(10^k\), and increments `n` until it becomes a multiple of `x`. It then prints the resulting value of `n`. If `n` is initially a multiple of `x`, it remains unchanged. The function does not handle invalid input cases where the input cannot be converted to integers. **
