To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the conditions it checks.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nauuo's comment will receive votes based on:
- `x`: Number of guaranteed upvotes
- `y`: Number of guaranteed downvotes
- `z`: Number of uncertain votes

The results can be:
- "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes (including uncertain votes).
- "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.
- "0" if upvotes equal downvotes and there are no uncertain votes.
- "?" if the result is uncertain due to the uncertain votes.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
if x > y + z:
    print('+')
elif x < y:
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
else:
    print('?')
```

1. **Condition 1**: `if x > y + z:`
   - This checks if guaranteed upvotes exceed the total of guaranteed downvotes and uncertain votes. If true, it prints "+".

2. **Condition 2**: `elif x < y:`
   - This checks if guaranteed downvotes exceed guaranteed upvotes. If true, it prints "-".

3. **Condition 3**: `elif x == y:`
   - This checks if guaranteed upvotes equal guaranteed downvotes:
     - If `z == 0`, it prints "0" (since there are no uncertain votes).
     - If `z > 0`, it prints "?" (since uncertain votes could tip the balance).

4. **Else Case**: This handles the case where `x` is less than or equal to `y` but doesn't fit previous conditions. This will print "?" when `x` is less than `y` or equal but with uncertain votes.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: `x = 0, y = 0, z = 1`
  - The expected output is "?" as uncertain votes could lead to either result.
  
- **Case 2**: `x = 1, y = 1, z = 0`
  - The expected output is "0" as there are no uncertain votes and both are equal.

- **Case 3**: `x = 2, y = 0, z = 1`
  - The expected output is "+" since guaranteed upvotes exceed guaranteed downvotes.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe the behavior of the function correctly:
- It states the conditions under which each output is produced.
- It correctly identifies the uncertain result when `x` is equal to `y` with `z > 0`, and when `x` is not equal to `y`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases as expected. There are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined.

Correctness: **True**.
