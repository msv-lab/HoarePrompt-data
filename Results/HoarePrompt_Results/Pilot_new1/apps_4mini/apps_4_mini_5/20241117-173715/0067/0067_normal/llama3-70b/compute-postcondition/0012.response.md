Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `z` is equal to 0, the output is '0'. Otherwise, the output is '?'. Additionally, since `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, it follows that `x` is also non-negative when `z` is zero, and can be any integer value when `z` is not zero.***
