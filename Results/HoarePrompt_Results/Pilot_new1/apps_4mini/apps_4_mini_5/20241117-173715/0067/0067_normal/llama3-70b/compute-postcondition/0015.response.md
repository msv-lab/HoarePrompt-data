Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is equal to 0, the output is '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not equal to 0, the output is '?'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, regardless of the value of `z`, the output is also '?'. Since `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, it follows that `x` is non-negative when `z` is zero, and can be any integer value when `z` is not zero.***
