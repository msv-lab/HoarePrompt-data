Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, input by the user. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, and '?' if `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`. The function does not return any values. **
