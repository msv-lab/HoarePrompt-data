The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The initial state indicates that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100, so the value of `max_upvotes` will depend on the specific values of `x` and `z`. However, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `max_upvotes` based on the values of `x` and `z`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, and `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`**
