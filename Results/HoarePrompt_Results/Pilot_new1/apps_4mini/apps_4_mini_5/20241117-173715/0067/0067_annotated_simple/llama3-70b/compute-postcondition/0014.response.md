The code executes a print statement that outputs the string `'?'`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as the print function does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z` and indicates that the string `'?'` has been printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100, `x` is greater than `y`, and the string '?' has been printed.**
