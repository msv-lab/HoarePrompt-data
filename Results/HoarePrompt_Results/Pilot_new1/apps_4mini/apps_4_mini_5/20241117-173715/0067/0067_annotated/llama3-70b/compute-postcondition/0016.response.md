Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is less than `y`, the function prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, it prints '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not 0, or if `x` is greater than `y`, the function prints '?'. Additionally, it holds that `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`).***
