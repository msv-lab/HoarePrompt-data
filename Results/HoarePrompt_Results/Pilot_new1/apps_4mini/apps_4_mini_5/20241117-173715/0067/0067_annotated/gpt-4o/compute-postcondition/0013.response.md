Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100. `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_upvotes` is an integer between 0 and 200. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, the output is '-' indicating that the maximum upvotes are insufficient compared to the minimum downvotes. If `max_downvotes` (which is equal to `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes`, the output is '+' indicating that the maximum downvotes are insufficient compared to the minimum upvotes. Otherwise, the output is '?' indicating that the maximum downvotes are greater than or equal to the minimum upvotes and within the range defined by the minimum and maximum upvotes. This covers all edge cases including when the values are at their boundaries.***
