To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code against the possible outcomes of the voting scenario.

### Program Analysis
The program takes three integers as input: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). It then checks the following conditions:

1. If `x > y + z`, it prints `+`. This means that even if all unknown voters voted down, upvotes would still be greater.
2. If `x < y`, it prints `-`. This means that upvotes are fewer than downvotes.
3. If `x == y`, it further checks:
   - If `z == 0`, it prints `0`, indicating a tie with no unknown votes.
   - If `z > 0`, it prints `?`, indicating uncertainty because the unknown votes could tip the balance either way.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to printing `?`, indicating uncertainty.

### Edge Cases
Now, let's evaluate the program against the provided examples and consider potential edge cases:

1. **Example 1**: `3 7 0` → Output: `-`
   - Correct, since there are 3 upvotes and 7 downvotes, the result is clearly `-`.

2. **Example 2**: `2 0 1` → Output: `+`
   - Correct, since even if the one unknown vote is a downvote, there are still more upvotes (2) than downvotes (0).

3. **Example 3**: `1 1 0` → Output: `0`
   - Correct, since there is an equal number of upvotes and downvotes.

4. **Example 4**: `0 0 1` → Output: `?`
   - Correct, since the outcome is uncertain with one unknown vote.

### Additional Test Cases
Now, let's consider some additional edge cases that may not have been covered:

- **Case**: `0 1 1`
  - Expected output: `?` (because unknown could be either upvote or downvote)
  - Program output: `?` (correct)

- **Case**: `0 0 0`
  - Expected output: `0` (no votes at all)
  - Program output: `?` (incorrect, should output `0`)

- **Case**: `100 100 100`
  - Expected output: `?` (because with 100 unknown votes, the result could be `+`, `-`, or `0`)
  - Program output: `?` (correct)

### Conclusion
The program fails for the case `0 0 0`, where it should output `0` but outputs `?`. Therefore, there is at least one input for which the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
