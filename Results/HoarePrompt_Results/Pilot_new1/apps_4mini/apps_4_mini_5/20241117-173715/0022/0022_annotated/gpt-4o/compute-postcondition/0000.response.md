The length of the string `s` is calculated using the `len()` function, which returns the number of characters in `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, the value of `n` will be assigned the length of `s`, which is guaranteed to be at least 1 and at most 1000. The state of other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s` (between 1 and 1000)**
