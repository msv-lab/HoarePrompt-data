The function accepts a string input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome. If the string reads the same forwards and backwards, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not handle input validation, so it assumes the input is a valid string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000.
