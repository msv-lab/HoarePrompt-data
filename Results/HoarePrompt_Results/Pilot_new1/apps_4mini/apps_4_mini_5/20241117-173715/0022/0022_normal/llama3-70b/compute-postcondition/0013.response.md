The variable `is_palindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 2, and `is_palindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 2, and `is_palindrome` is False**
