Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, the value of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, and the program continues to check further characters in the palindrome verification process.***
