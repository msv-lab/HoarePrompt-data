To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and the problem description closely. 

The problem is to determine if a string is an "s-palindrome," which is defined as being symmetric about the middle of the string. According to the problem description:

1. A string is an "s-palindrome" if the first half of the string mirrors the second half.
2. The string should consist only of English letters and can be of length between 1 and 1000.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    return True
```

### Code Analysis:
- The function calculates the length of the string `s` and stores it in `n`.
- It then loops from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`, checking if the character at position `i` from the start of the string is equal to the character at position `n - 1 - i` from the end of the string.
- If it finds any pair of characters that are not equal, it returns `False`, indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome."
- If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`, indicating that the string is an "s-palindrome."

### Issues with the Code:
The code is checking for a regular palindrome, which means it checks if the string reads the same forwards and backwards. However, the problem specifically states that the string must be symmetric about the middle, which requires a different comparison.

For example:
- The string "aa" is considered a regular palindrome but is not an "s-palindrome" according to the problem description since the second half does not mirror the first half.
- The string "oXoxoXo" is an "s-palindrome" because it is symmetric about the middle.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a string is an "s-palindrome." It fails for cases like "aa" and does not handle the required symmetry check as described in the problem statement. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
