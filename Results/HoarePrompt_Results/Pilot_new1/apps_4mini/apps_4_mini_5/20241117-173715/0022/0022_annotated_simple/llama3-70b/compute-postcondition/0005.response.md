The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `is_spalindrome`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `is_spalindrome` is False, and the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s**.
