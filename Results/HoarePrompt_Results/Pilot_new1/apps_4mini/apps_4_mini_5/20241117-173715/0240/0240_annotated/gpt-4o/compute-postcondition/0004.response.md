Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `perm` is equal to `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, there is no output from the function.***
