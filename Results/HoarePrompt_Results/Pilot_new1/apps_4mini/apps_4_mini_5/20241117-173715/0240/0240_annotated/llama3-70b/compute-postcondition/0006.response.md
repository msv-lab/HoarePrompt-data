According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `s`. Since `s` is a string of digits with length greater than 0, it has at least one character, and `c` is currently the first character of `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the first character of `s`, and we need to determine the next character for the loop to execute again. The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `s`.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
1. `c` should be updated to the next character in `s`.
2. The length of `s` must be considered to ensure that `c` does not exceed the bounds of the string. 

If `s` has more than one character, `c` will be updated to the next character in `s`, which would be the second character. If `s` has only one character, the loop will not execute again, and `c` would not change.

Since `n` is an empty string and `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, it will depend on whether the next character `c` is in `t_set` or not. 

Thus, assuming that `s` has at least two characters, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`s` is a string of digits with length greater than 1, `c` is the second character of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is updated to be equal to `c` if `c` is in `t_set`, otherwise `n` remains an empty string.**
