According to the code, the loop will execute for each permutation of the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is equal to `chars`, which indicates that the last permutation generated was the original string. The next permutation needs to be different from the current one.

Since `perm` is being reassigned in each iteration of the loop, to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence. Additionally, since `candidate` is equal to `chars`, it indicates that `candidate` is currently the original string.

For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be set to the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` should be updated accordingly. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `perm` should be the next permutation after `chars`.
- `candidate` should also reflect this new permutation.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`**
