The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, it is equal to `chars`. Therefore, `candidate` will hold the same value as `chars`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `perm` is `chars`, and `candidate` is `chars`**
