The value of `n` is updated by appending `t` to it. Since `n` is initially described as a string containing characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`, and if `s` is empty or `t_set` is empty, `n` remains an empty string. The contents of `t` are not specified, but we can assume it is a string to be appended. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the previous string plus `t`.

Output State: **`n` is the previous string plus `t`**
