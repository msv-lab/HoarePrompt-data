Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the second character of `s`, and `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to include `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains an empty string. In all cases, `n` will either contain `c` if it is a member of `t_set` or remain unchanged as an empty string if it is not.***
