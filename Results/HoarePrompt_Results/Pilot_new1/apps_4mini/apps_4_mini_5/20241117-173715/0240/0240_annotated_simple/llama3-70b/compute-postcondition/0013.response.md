Output State: **`n` is a string containing the characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string. If `t_set` is empty, the loop executes but `n` remains an empty string regardless of the contents of `s`. If `s` contains digits not in `t_set`, those digits are ignored in the construction of `n`.**
