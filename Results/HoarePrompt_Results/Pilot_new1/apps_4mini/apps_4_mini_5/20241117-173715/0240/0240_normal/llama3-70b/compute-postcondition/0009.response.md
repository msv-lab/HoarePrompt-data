According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of digits with at least 2 characters, and `c` is the second character of `s`. This indicates that the loop has already processed at least the first two characters of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`. Since `s` has at least 2 characters, after processing the second character, the next character to be processed will be the third character of `s`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `c` should be updated to the third character of `s`.
- The iteration index should be incremented accordingly.

State: **`s` is a string of digits with at least 2 characters, `c` is the third character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, and `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`**
