Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`. It constructs a new string `n` by concatenating characters from `s` that are also present in `t`, followed by the entire string `t`. Finally, it returns the integer value of the resulting string `n`. If `s` contains no characters found in `t`, `n` will consist solely of `t`, and if `s` is empty, the function will return the integer value of `t`. The function does not handle cases where the concatenated string `n` may lead to a very large integer value that could cause overflow in certain contexts.**
