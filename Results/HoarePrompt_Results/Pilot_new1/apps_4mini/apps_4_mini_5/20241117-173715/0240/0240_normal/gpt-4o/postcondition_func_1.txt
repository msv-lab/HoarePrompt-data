The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It checks if `sub` is present in `num_str` and returns `True` only if `num_str` has a specific length that is not defined in the function (as `n_len` is not set within the function). If either condition is not met, it returns `False`. The function does not define or check `n_len`, which may lead to a NameError if `n_len` is not defined in the surrounding scope.
