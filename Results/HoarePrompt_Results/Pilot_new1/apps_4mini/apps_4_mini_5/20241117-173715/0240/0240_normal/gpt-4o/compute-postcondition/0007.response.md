The `yield` statement produces the value of `candidate`, which is the string formed by joining `perm`. The `yield` does not change the state of the other variables, but it indicates that a value is being returned from the function. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate`, while also noting the value that is yielded.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
