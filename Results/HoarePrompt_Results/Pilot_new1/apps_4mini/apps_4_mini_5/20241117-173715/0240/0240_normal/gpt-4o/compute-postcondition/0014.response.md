Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and no candidates are yielded. If `sub` contains invalid characters or if `chars` does not provide any valid permutations that satisfy `sub`, then no candidates are yielded despite the loop executing.**
