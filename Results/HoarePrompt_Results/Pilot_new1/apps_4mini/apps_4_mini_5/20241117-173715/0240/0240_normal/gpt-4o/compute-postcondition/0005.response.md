According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `chars` string and the permutations generated from it. Given that `chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, the `permutations(chars)` function will generate all possible permutations of the string.

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`. Since permutations are generated in a specific order, for the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. 

The state does not need any adjustments regarding `candidate` or `is_valid_number` since the loop's continuation is solely dependent on the permutations of `chars`. The only necessary adjustment is to indicate that `perm` is now the next permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.**
