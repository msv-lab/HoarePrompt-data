According to the code, the loop will execute for each character `c` in the string `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the string `s` must not be empty. Since `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, we need to ensure that it has at least one character. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an empty string, which does not affect the execution of the loop. However, we must establish the state of `c` at the beginning of the loop execution.

To summarize, for the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character, and `c` should be initialized to the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, `n` is an empty string**
