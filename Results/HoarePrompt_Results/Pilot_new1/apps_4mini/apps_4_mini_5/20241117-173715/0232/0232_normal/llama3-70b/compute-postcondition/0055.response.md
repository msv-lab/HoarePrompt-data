According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than `i`, which is already stated as true in the current state. 

Before the loop starts, `found` is False, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary. The loop will start with `j` initialized to `i`. Since `n` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `j` should be equal to `i`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute are that `j` is initialized to `i`, and we confirm that `found` remains False and `window_counts` is still an empty dictionary.

State: **`found` is False, `n` is greater than `i`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is `i`**
