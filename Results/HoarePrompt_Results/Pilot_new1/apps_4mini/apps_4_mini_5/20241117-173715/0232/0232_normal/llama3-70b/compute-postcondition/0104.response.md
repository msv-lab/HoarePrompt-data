The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is set to True; `window_counts[color]` is now updated; `colors` remains a non-empty list; `n` is greater than `i`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
