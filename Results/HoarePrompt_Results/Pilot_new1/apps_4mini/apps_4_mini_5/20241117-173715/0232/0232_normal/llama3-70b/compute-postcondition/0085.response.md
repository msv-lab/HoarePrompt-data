Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop, leaving `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary. Additionally, if `colors` is an empty list or if `n` is equal to or less than `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, with `found` still being False.***
