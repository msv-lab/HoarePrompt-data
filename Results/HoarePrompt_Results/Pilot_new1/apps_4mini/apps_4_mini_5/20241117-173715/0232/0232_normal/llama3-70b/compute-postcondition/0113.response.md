Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, indicating a successful match; `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 1. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no changes occur to `found` or other variables.***
