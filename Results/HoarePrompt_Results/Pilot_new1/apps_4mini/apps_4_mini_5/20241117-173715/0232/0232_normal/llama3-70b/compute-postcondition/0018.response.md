Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where keys are unique colors from the `colors` list and values are the counts of those colors. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `colors` contains at least one element, the loop will execute for each element in `colors`, incrementing the corresponding count in `color_counts`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and `colors` is a list of integers with a length equal to or less than `n`.**
