The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is now True, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, with all values in `window_counts` equal to their corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
