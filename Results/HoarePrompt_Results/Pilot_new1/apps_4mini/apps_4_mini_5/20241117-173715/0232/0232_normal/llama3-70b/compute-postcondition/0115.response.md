Output State: **`found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. If `j` iterates from `i` to `n - 1`, `window_counts` will contain counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[n - 1]`. If the loop does not execute (if `n` is not greater than `i`), `found` remains False, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `colors` remains a non-empty list, and the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are unchanged.**
