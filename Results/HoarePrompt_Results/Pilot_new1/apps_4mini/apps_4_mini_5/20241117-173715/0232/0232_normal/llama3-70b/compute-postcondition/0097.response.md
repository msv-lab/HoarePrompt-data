Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, indicating that the desired counts of colors are met. In this case, `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 1 or `color` is incremented by 1, `colors` remains a non-empty list, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` is equal to `i`, where `color` is `colors[j]`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False and no changes are made to the variables.***
