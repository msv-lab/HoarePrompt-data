Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `n` is greater than `i`, the loop executes with `j` starting from `i` and incrementing until `n - 1`, updating `window_counts` with the counts of colors from the `colors` list. If the loop finds a match, it breaks out, otherwise it continues until `j` reaches `n - 1`.**
