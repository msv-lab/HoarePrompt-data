The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is `i + 1`. The value of `j` is determined by the previous value of `i`, which remains unchanged. Since `n` is greater than `i + 1`, this means that `j` is a valid index within the `colors` array. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the new assignment of `color`.

Output State: **`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is `i + 1`**
