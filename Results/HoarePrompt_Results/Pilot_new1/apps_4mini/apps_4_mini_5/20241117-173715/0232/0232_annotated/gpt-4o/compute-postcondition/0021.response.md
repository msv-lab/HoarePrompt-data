Output State: **`current_counts` contains the counts of colors processed up to the point where the loop stopped. If at any point all counts in `current_counts` meet or exceed the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function will return 'YES'. If the initial state of `current_counts` does not meet the criteria (e.g., if any count is less than its desired count), the loop will not execute, and `left` will remain 0. If `right` reaches `n`, it indicates that all colors have been processed, and the loop will stop, with `left` indicating how many elements have been removed from the left side of the window. If `n` is 1, the loop executes at least once and adjusts `current_counts` accordingly. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop will execute up to `n` times depending on the conditions of `current_counts` and `desired_counts`.**
