Postcondition: ***`window_counts` has `color` with a value of 1 if `color` was not already a key; otherwise, `window_counts` remains unchanged. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop. Additionally, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` is equal to `i`. If the condition is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
