Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is an empty dictionary initially. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. The variable `found` remains True, `i` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` is equal to `i`. If `color` already exists in `window_counts`, no changes are made to the dictionary, and the other variables retain their values.***
