Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `found` is True, the loop exits, and `window_counts` contains the updated counts of colors from the `colors` list, while `i` and `n` remain unchanged with `n` being greater than 0. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` being empty, `found` remaining False, and both `i` and `n` retaining their values, with `n` being 0 or greater.***
