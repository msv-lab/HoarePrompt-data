Postcondition: ***`window_counts` has `color` with a value of 0 if it was not previously a key in `window_counts`. The value of `found` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` is equal to `i + 1; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was already a key in `window_counts`, it remains unchanged.***
