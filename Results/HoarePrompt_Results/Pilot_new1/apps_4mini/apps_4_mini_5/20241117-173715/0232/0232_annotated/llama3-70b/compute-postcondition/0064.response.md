Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` (sorted) are equal to their corresponding values in `counts`, indicating a successful match; otherwise, `found` remains False. The variable `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `n` is greater than `i`, with `color` assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
