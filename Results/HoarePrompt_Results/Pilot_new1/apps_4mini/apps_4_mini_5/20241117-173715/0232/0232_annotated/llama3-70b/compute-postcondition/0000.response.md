The values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on the input provided, where `map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and converts them to integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not known, but they will now hold the values from the input. Other variables `colors` and `counts` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `m` are now defined based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and now `n` and `m` are assigned values from input.**
