The value at `colors[right]` is used to index into `current_counts`, and the current value at that index is incremented by 1. Since `right` is `n-1` and `n` is greater than `n-1`, we can safely assume that `right` is a valid index for the `colors` list. The value of `current_counts` at the index corresponding to `colors[right]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`current_counts` is updated at the index `colors[right]`, incrementing its value by 1; `right` is n-1, `n` is greater than n-1**
