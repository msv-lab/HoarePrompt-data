The variable `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not present in `color_counts`, it would have been initialized to 0 before this operation, resulting in `color_counts[color]` becoming 1. If `color` was already present, its previous value would be increased by 1. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated count for `color` in `color_counts`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first element in the `colors` list, and `color_counts[color]` is updated to its previous value plus 1.**
