Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `m` is an integer in the range 1 to `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of the elements in `k` is between 1 and `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, and `current_counts` has been updated with the count of `colors[right]` increased by 1. If the counts in `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding desired counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If not, the function proceeds without returning any value, indicating that the desired counts have not been met.
