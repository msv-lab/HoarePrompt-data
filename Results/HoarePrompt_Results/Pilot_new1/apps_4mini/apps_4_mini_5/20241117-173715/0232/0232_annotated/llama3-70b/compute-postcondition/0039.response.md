Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, while `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1, with `window_counts[color]` still incremented by 1.***
