The assignment `window_counts = {}` initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is between 0 and `n-1`, `color` is assigned a value from `colors`, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is between 0 and `n-1`, `color` is assigned a value from `colors`, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.**
