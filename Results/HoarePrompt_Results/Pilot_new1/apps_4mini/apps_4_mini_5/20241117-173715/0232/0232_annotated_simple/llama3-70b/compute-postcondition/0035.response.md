Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
