The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The input will provide `n` integers, which will populate the `colors` list. The previous values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, while the `colors` list is updated based on the input. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input; `counts` is a list of `m` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input; `counts` is a list of `m` integers.**
