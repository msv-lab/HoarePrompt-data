Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `right` is 0, `left` is 0, and at least one `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]`. If all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]` for all colors, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it does not return anything.***
