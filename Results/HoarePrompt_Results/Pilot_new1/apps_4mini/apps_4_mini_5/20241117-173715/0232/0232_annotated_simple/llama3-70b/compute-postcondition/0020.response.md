According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 at the beginning of the loop. Since `found` is already set to False, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `n` is greater than 0 and that `i` starts at 0.

State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
