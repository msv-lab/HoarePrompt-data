Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop is exited immediately, leaving `i` as 0, `n` greater than 0, `j` between 0 and `n-1`, and `color` assigned a value from `colors` based on the current value of `j`, while `window_counts` contains the counts of each color encountered in the range from `i` to `n-1`. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, resulting in `found` remaining False, `i` as 0, `n` greater than 0, `j` undefined, `color` undefined, and `window_counts` empty.***
