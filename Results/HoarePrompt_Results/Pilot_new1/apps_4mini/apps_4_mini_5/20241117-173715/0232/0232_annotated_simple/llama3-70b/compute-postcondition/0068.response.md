Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `color` is assigned a value from `colors[1]`. If `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is now set to 0. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
