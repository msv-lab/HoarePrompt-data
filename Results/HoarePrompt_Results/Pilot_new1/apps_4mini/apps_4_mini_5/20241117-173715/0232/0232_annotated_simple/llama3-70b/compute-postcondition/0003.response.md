The code initializes an empty dictionary `color_counts`. This does not affect the previous values of `n`, `m`, `colors`, or `counts`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new state of `color_counts`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input; `counts` is a list of integers from input; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary {}**
