The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The variables `found`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `found`, `i`, and `n`, along with the new variable `window_counts`.

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
