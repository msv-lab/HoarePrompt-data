Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts in `window_counts` match the target counts after sorting, `found` remains True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, the program continues executing without changing the value of `found`.***
