Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `i` as 0, `n` greater than 0, `j` between 0 and `n-1`, `color` assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` updated accordingly. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, `found` remains False, `i` is 0, `n` is 0, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary.***
