Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, indicating that the current window has the required counts of colors. If this condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, effectively terminating the search for a valid window. If the condition is not met, the state of `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing the subsequent code outside of this if statement.***
