Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop is exited, leaving `j` as the index of the last processed color (at most `n - 1`), `color` as the color at index `j` in the `colors` list, and `window_counts` containing the counts of colors encountered from index `i` to `j`. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, resulting in `found` remaining False, `j` being undefined, `color` being undefined, and `window_counts` unchanged. This takes into account the cases where `n` is 0 or less, leading to `found` being False, `j` undefined, `color` undefined, and `window_counts` being an empty dictionary.***
