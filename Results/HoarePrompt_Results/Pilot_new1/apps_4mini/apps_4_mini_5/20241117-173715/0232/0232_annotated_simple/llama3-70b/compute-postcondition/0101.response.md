Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, no changes are made to `window_counts`.***
