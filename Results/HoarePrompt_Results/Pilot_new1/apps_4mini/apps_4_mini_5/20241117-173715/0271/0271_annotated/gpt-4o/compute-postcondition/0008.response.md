The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on a non-negative integer `n` that is constrained such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The output of the function is determined by this integer. However, since the function definition provided does not specify any return values or cases, we cannot describe the functionality in terms of specific outputs. Therefore, we can only state the parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on a non-negative integer n, constrained such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The specific return value is not defined.**
