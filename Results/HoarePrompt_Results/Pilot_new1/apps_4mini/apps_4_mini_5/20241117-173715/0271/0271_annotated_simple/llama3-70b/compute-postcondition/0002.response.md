The code executes a `print` statement which outputs the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer within the range 0 to 10^9 and is a multiple of 10, the value of `n` is printed as it is. The state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer within the range 0 to 10^9 and is a multiple of 10, and the function prints `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 0 to 10^9 and is a multiple of 10, and the function prints `n`**
