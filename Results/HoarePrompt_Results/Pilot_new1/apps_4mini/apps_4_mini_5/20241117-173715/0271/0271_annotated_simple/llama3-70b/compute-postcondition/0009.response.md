Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 0 to 10^9. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function prints `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the function prints the nearest lower multiple of 10. If the remainder is greater than 5, the function prints the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`.***
