The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Since `remainder` is the last digit of `n` and is less than or equal to 5, the value of `result` will be `n` minus a non-negative integer that is at most 5. The state of `n` and `remainder` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and `result` is `n - remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and `result` is `n - remainder**
