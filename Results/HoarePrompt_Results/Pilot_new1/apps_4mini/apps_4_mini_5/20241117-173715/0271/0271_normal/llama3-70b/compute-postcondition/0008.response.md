Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is not a multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, the printed value is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, the printed value is the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`, which can be either `n + 1`, `n + 2`, `n + 3`, or `n + 4`.***
