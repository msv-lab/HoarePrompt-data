To determine the output state, we analyze the code snippet provided:

The code assigns the value of `max_lemons` to the minimum of three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.

Since we do not have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can state that:

- `max_lemons` will be assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_lemons` is determined by the minimum of the three expressions.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
