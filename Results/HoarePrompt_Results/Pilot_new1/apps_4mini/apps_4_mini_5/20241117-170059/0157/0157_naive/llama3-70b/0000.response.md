Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used to create the compote in the specified ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the given ratio:
   - The number of lemons that can be used is limited by `a`.
   - The number of apples that can be used is limited by `b // 2` (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon).
   - The number of pears that can be used is limited by `c // 4` (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).
3. The `min` function determines the limiting factor among these three quantities, which gives the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`).
4. The total number of fruits used is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which corresponds to the total number of lemons, apples, and pears used in the compote.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there are not enough pears or apples to make even one set of the compote (resulting in a total of 0). Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem requirements for all potential cases.
