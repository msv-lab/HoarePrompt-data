The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with three positive integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. Since there is no output provided in the description, we cannot determine the specific return values or functionality of the function based solely on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently undefined without further details. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is currently undefined without additional information.**
