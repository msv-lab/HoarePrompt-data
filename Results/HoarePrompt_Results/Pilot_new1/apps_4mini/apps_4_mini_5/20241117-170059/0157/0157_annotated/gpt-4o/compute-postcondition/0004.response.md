To determine the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is an input integer
   - `c` is an input integer
   - `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The variable `total_fruits` is assigned the value calculated as follows:
     - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`
     - This can be simplified to `total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which is `total_fruits = max_lemons * 7`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `total_fruits` is now dependent on the value of `max_lemons`.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `max_lemons`) remain unchanged in terms of their values, but `total_fruits` is now defined.

4. **Output State**:
   - We need to reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `max_lemons`, along with the newly computed `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4; total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7**.
