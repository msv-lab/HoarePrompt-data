To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Nikolay has `a` lemons, `b` apples, and `c` pears.
2. The fruits must be in the ratio of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears).
3. We need to calculate the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote.
4. If no fruits can be used, the output should be `0`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: 
   - `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of:
     - The number of lemons `a`.
     - Half the number of apples `b // 2` (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon).
     - A quarter of the number of pears `c // 4` (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).
3. **Total Fruits Calculation**:
   - The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
     - `max_lemons * 1` (for lemons)
     - `max_lemons * 2` (for apples)
     - `max_lemons * 4` (for pears)
4. **Output**: The total number of fruits is printed.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `2`, `5`, `7`
   - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
   - Total: `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `4`, `7`, `13`
   - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
   - Total: `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2`, `3`, `2`
   - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
   - Total: `0` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` is at its minimum (1):
  - Input: `1`, `1`, `1`
  - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4) = min(1, 0, 0) = 0`
  - Total: `0` (Correct)

- If `a`, `b`, or `c` is at its maximum (1000):
  - Input: `1000`, `2000`, `4000`
  - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(1000, 2000 // 2, 4000 // 4) = min(1000, 1000, 1000) = 1000`
  - Total: `1000 + 2000 + 4000 = 7000` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and the problem description, all potential cases, including edge cases, yield the expected results as per the problem requirements. The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
