The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with values constrained to the range 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function does not return any specific output described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three positive integers representing quantities of fruits, but the details regarding what the function does with these parameters or what it returns are not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, within the range 1 to 1000.**
