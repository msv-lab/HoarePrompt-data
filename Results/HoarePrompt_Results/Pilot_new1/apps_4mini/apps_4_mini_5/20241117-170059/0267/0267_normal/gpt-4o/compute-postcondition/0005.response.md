According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `num` starting from `l` and going up to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `num` should be `l + 1`. 

Additionally, since `num` must remain within the range defined by `l` and `r`, we need to ensure that `num` does not exceed `r`. Given that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, incrementing `num` to `l + 1` will still satisfy the condition `num <= r`.

No other variables need to be adjusted because `total_sum`, `k`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged for the next iteration.

State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l + 1`**
