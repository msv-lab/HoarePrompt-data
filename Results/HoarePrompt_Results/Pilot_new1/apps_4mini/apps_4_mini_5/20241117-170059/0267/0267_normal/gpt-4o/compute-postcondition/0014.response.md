The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters are defined as follows: `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). 

After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of all numbers in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, it returns the value based on the result of `func_1(l, k)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` defining a range, and an integer `k`, then return the sum of numbers within that range that satisfy a condition defined by another function, while also handling specific cases for range validity and equality.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all numbers in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy a condition defined by `func_1`, modulo `MOD`, or 0 if `l` is greater than `r`. If `l` equals `r`, it returns the value based on `func_1(l, k)`.**
