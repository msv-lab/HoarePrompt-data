According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from `1` to `k - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than `1`. 

Given the constraints:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\)
- `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\)
- `dp[n, k]` is 9

We need to ensure that `k` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` should be greater than 1, specifically `k` can be 2, 3, ..., or 10.
- `i` should start at 1.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is 1**
