In the given code snippet, `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + num) % MOD`, which simplifies to `num % MOD`.

Since `l` is unchanged and `num` is `l + 1`, we can represent the new state based on these calculations.

Output State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is (l + 1) % MOD, `num` is l + 1**
