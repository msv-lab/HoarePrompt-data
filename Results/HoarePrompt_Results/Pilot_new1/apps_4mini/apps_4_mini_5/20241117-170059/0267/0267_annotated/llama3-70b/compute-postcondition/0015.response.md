The expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` updates the value of `dp[n, k]`. 

1. The current value of `dp[n, k]` is initially 90.
2. The variable `i` is defined as `k - 1`.
3. The term `10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** (k - 2)`.
4. The term `10 ** (k - i)` simplifies to `10 ** 1`, which is `10`.
5. Hence, the expression becomes `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (k - 2) * (10 - 10 ** (k - 2))`.

Since `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation involving `k`, but the final value of `dp[n, k]` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `k`, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of the update. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the initial value of `dp[n, k]` and indicates that it has been updated based on the formula involving `k` and `i`.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is initially 90, and it is updated based on the expression involving `k` and `i` (where `i` is `k - 1`)**.
