According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the values from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l < r\) and `r` is an integer such that \(r \geq l + 2\). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to take on the next value in the range, which would be `l + 1` since the loop starts at `l`. After the last iteration, `num` would be equal to `r` (the last value in the range), so for the loop to execute again, `num` must be `r + 1`, which would exceed the upper limit of the range.

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `r` to ensure that the loop can execute once more. Specifically, we can increase `r` by 1, ensuring it remains greater than or equal to `l + 2`, while `l` remains unchanged.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` < `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to `l + 3`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is initially 0.**
