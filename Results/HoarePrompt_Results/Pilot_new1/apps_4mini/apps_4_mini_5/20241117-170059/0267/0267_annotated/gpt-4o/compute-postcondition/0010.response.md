Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` < `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to `l + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is initially 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` is updated to (0 + num) % MOD. If `func_1(num, k)` returns False, `total_sum` remains 0.***
