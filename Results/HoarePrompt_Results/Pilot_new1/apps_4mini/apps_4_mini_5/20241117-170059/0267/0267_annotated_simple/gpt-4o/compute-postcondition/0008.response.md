According to the code, the loop can execute based on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over `num` starting from `l` and goes up to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 1`. 

To determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time, we need to check if `num` can take on a value that is still within the range defined by `l` and `r`. Since `num` is currently `l + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `num` must be incremented to `l + 2`.

We also need to ensure that `l + 2` is less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l <= r`, this means we need to adjust the state to ensure that `r` is at least `l + 2` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `r` must be at least `l + 2`.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that r >= l + 2, and `num` is equal to `l + 2`.**
