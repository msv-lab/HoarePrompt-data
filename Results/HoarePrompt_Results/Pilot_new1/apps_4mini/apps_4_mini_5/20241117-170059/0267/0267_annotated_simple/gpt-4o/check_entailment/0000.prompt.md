You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.
Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the number of unique digits in the string representation of n is less than or equal to k, for some integer n in the range [l, r].

#Function 2:
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_sum` is the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns True, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, or if the range is empty (i.e., if `l` is equal to `r` and `func_1(r, k)` returns False), then `total_sum` remains 0. If there are no integers in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` will also remain 0.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns True, modulo `MOD`, or 0 if the conditions for `total_sum` are not met.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
