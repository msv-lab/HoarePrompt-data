According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k` (exclusive). The loop will execute if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is 2. Since `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2. However, since `i` is already 1 and will be incremented in the next iteration, there is no need to adjust `l`, `r`, `k`, `n`, or `dp[n, k]`. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 90, `i` is 2**
