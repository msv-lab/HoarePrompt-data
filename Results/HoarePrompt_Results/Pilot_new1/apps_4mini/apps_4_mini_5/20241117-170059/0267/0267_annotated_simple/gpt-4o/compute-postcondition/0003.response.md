The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is equal to `l`, which is an integer within the range specified (1 <= l <= r < 10^18). The value of `total_sum` starts at 0, so after the operation, `total_sum` will be `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`. The other variables (`l`, `r`, and `num`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `num` is equal to `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true.

Output State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `num` is equal to `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true.**
