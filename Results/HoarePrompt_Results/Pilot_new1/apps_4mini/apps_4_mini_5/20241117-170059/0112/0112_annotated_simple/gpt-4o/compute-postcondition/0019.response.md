Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. If `used_cubes[1]` is not already used and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either condition is not met, `used_cubes[1]` remains unchanged, and `found` retains its previous value.***
