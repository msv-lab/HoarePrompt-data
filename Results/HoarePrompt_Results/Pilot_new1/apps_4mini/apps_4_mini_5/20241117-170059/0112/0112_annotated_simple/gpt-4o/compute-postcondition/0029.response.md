According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. The loop iterates over each element in `digits`, and since `digit` is currently the second element in the list, for the loop to execute one more time, `digits` must have at least 3 elements. 

At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 elements, and `digit` is the second element in the list. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to update the state to reflect that `digit` will be the third element in the list and that `i` will be updated to 2 (since indexing starts at 0).

State: **`used_cubes` remains unchanged, found is False, i is 2, digits has at least 3 elements, digit is the third element in the list**
