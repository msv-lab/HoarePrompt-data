The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, but it was already `False`, so there is no change in its value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is undefined, `digits` has at least 2 elements, `digit` is the second element in the list.

Output State: **`used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is undefined, `digits` has at least 2 elements, `digit` is the second element in the list**
