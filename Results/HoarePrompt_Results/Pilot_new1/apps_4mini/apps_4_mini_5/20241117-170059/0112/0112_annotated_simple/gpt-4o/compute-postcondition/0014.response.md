Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, and `i` is 1. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes` and `found` remain unchanged.***
