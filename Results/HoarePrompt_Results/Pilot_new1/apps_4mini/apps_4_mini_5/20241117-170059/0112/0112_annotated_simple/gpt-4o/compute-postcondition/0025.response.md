According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` iterable. The loop will iterate over each element in `digits`, so for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `digits` than what has already been iterated.

At the end of the last iteration, if `found` is False, the function returns False, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged with `found` being False and `i` being undefined. If `found` is True, the state of `used_cubes`, `found`, and `i` will depend on the previous operations, but since `i` is undefined, we can't determine its value.

Since the state mentions that `i` is undefined and does not provide information about the current position in the `digits` iterable, we can only conclude that `digits` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, to adjust the state, we need to ensure that `digits` has at least one more element than it had at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is True or False, `i` is undefined, `digits` has at least one more element than before**
