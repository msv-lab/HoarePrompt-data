Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all unique digits found in the lists within `cubes`. If `n` is less than 1 or if `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. If `n` is 1, 2, or 3, `digits` contains the unique string representations of the digits from the respective lists. If '0' was present in `digits`, it has been removed; thus, `digits` will not contain '0' after the execution of the if statement.***
