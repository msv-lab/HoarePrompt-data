The variable `cubes` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The outer list comprehension runs `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 3. Since `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, the resulting variable `cubes` will contain either 1, 2, or 3 lists of integers based on the user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on the input**
