The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since '0' is included in `digits`, it will be successfully removed. The other elements in the set remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that '0' has been removed from `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers from the lists in `cubes`, excluding '0'**
