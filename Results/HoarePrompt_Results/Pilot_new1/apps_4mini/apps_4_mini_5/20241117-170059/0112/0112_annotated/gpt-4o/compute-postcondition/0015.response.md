According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased to 2. Since `n` is at least 1, it is necessary to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `n` is at least 2 and update `i` to 2. Other variables such as `cube_faces` and `digits` do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop execution condition.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character**
