Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, and `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values. If `used_cubes[i]` was `False` and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]` or `used_cubes[i]` was already `True`, then `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged, `found` remains `False`, and no changes occur to the state of the program.***
