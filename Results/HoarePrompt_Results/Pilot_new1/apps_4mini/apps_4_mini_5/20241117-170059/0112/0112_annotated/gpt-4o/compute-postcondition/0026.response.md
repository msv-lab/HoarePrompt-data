The value of `found` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of `n` and `digits` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `n` is at least 1, `digits` has at least one more digit available.

Output State: **`found` is False, `n` is at least 1, `digits` has at least one more digit available**
