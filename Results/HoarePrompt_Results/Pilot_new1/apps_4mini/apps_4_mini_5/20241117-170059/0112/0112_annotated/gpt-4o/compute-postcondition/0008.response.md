The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values with `used_cubes[i]` now set to `True`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
