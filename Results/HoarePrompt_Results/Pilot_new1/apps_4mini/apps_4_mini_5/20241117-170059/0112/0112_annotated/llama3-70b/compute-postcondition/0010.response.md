Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all integers from the lists in `cubes`. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, the loop executes at least once and `digits` will include the string representations of the integers in the first list, and subsequently updated for each additional list in `cubes`.**
