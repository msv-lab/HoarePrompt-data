The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. This does not affect the previous values of `n` or `cubes`, as they remain unchanged. The output state reflects the current values of all variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on the input; `digits` is an empty set**
