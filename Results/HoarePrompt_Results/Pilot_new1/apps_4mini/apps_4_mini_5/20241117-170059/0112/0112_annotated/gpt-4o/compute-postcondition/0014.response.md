Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, and if `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged, and `found` retains its previous value.***
