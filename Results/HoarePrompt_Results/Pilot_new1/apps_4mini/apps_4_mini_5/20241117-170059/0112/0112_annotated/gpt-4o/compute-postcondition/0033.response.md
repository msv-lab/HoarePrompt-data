Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if it can be formed using a list of `cube_faces`. It returns True if each digit of `num` can be matched to a unique cube face, and False if any digit cannot be matched or if no cubes are available (i.e., if `n` is less than 1). The function does not handle the case where `cube_faces` is not defined or is empty, which could lead to an error. Additionally, if `num` is 0, it will return True since the digit '0' can be matched if '0' is present in any cube face. **
