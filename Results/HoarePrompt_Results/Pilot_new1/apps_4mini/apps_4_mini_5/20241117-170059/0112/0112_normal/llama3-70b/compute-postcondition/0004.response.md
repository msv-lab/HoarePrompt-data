The code updates the `digits` set with string representations of each integer in the `cube`. The variable `cube` holds the first list from `cubes`, which contains integers. Since `digits` is initially an empty set, it will be populated with the string versions of the integers found in `cube`. The previous state of `n` does not affect this operation, and the state of `cubes` does not change either.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first cube in cubes, and `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
