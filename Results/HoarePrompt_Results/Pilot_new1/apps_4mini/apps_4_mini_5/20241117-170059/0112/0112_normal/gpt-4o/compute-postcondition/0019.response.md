Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either condition is not met, `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged, and `found` retains its previous value.***
