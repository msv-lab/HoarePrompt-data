The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3\). Additionally, the function expects each cube to be represented by a list of 6 integers \(a_{i,j}\) where \(0 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 9\). The function does not return any output as it is currently defined. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` representing the number of cubes and a list of integers for each cube, but it does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of 6 integers for each cube (0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 9), but does not return any value.**
