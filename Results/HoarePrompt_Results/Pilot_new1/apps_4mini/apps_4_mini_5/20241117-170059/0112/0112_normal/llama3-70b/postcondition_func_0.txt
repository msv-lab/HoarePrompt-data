The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lists of integers (each containing 6 integers ranging from 0 to 9). It collects unique digit characters from these lists, removes '0' if it exists, and then constructs and prints the largest possible integer that can be formed by the remaining digits. If all digits are '0', the function will print an empty string since the largest number would be 0 but it is removed from the digits set. The function does not return any value.
