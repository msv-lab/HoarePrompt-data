The variable `digits` is assigned an empty set. The initial state of `n` and `cubes` remains unchanged, as this line does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `cubes`, along with the new state of `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on input; `digits` is an empty set**
