According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, which is initialized with all elements set to False. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment up to `n-1` during the loop iterations. 

For the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `used_cubes` is a list of length n with all elements set to False, `digits` is defined and contains at least 1 element, `found` is False**
