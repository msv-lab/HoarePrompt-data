Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`, which contains `num` lists of 6 integers each (representing the faces of cubes). It checks if all digits of `num` can be formed using the cube faces, ensuring that each cube face can only be used once per digit. The function returns True if all digits can be formed; otherwise, it returns False. If `num` is 0, the function will return True since an empty list of digits means there are no digits to form. However, the function does not handle cases where `cube_faces` is empty or does not contain enough cube faces to match the digits of `num`, which could lead to incorrect results.**
