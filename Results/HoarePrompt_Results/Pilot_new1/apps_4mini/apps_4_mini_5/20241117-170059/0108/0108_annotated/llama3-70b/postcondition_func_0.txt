The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string `res` by replacing each character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet until all occurrences of that character are replaced. If `res` contains all 26 letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` remains empty and -1 is printed. The function does not handle uppercase letters or non-alphabet characters, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such characters were present in `s`.
