The code snippet prints the value of `target`. The variable `s` contains all characters of `target` in order, which implies that `target` itself is also defined. The values of `j` and `i` are not directly affected by the print statement. Since `target` is printed, it will display its value. 

Therefore, the output state is: `s` contains all characters of `target` in order, `j` is equal to `target_len`, `i` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, and the function prints `target`.

Output State: **`s` contains all characters of `target` in order, `j` is equal to `target_len`, `i` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, and the function prints `target`**
