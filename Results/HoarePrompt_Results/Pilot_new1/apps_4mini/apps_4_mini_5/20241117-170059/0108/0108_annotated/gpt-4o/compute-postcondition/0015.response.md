The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`, which means `i` can take on values from 0 to at least `len(s) - 2`. The value of `j` is less than 26, and its state is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `j` is less than 26; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `j` is less than 26; `i` is increased by 1**
