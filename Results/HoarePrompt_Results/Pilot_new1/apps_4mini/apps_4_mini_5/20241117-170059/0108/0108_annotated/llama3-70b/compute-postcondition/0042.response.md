Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of consecutive occurrences of each character in `s` in alphabetical order, and if `res` contains all 26 characters from 'a' to 'z', the function prints `res` and `s` has been modified to contain no characters less than 'z'. If `res` contains fewer than 26 characters, `s` remains unchanged, `char` has not reached 'z', and -1 has been printed.***
