The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. This operation does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `res`, `s`, and `char`. The output state includes the fact that `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of fewer than 26 characters, `s` remains unchanged, `char` has not reached 'z', and -1 has been printed.**
