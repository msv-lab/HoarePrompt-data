The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown as it is only stated to be less than 26. The value of `i` and the string `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `i` is less than len(s) - 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is less than len(s) - 1**
