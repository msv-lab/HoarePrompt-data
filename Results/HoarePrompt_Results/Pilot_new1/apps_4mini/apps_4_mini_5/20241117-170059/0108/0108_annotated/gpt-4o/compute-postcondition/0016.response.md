To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop, which are `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`.

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `s` is a string with a length greater than 1, `len(s)` is at least 2. Thus, `i` must be less than this length for the loop to continue.

2. **Condition on `j`**: We also have the condition `j < target_len`. Since `j` is stated to be less than 26, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `target_len` for the loop to execute again.

Based on this analysis, the following adjustments can be made:
- Since `i` has been increased by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(s)`. Therefore, we can state that `i` must be less than `len(s) - 1`.
- For `j`, we need to ensure that it remains less than `target_len`. However, we do not have any information about `target_len` in relation to `j`, so we keep `j` as is.

Thus, the final state should reflect that `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `j` is less than 26; `i` is less than len(s) - 1**
