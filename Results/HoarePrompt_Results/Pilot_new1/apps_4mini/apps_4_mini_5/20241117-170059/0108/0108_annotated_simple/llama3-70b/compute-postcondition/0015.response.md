The code `res += char` appends the value of `char`, which is 'z', to the existing value of `res`. Since `res` initially contains the string of 'a's found in `s`, the new value of `res` will be the original string of 'a's followed by 'z'. The variable `s` remains unchanged, and `char` does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `s` contains 'a', `res` is the string of 'a's followed by 'z', and `char` is 'z'.

Output State: **`s` contains 'a', `res` is the string of 'a's followed by 'z', `char` is 'z'**
