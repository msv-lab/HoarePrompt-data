The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` can either be 0 or 1, after the execution, `j` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `s` and `target_len` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `len(s)` is greater than 2, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `target_len` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `len(s)` is greater than 2, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `target_len` is greater than 1**
