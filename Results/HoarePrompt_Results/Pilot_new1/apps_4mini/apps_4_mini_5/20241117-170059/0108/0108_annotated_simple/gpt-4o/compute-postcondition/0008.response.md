According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `s`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `len(s)`. This means that `len(s)` must be greater than 1. 

The variable `j` must also be less than `target_len` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `j` is either 0 or 1, if `j` is currently 1, then `target_len` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
1. Ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 1.
2. If `j` is 1, then `target_len` must be greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `len(s)` is greater than 1, and if `j` is 1, then `target_len` is greater than 1**
