The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. The initial value of `res` is 'axzz', and `char` is 'z'. After the execution of the code, `res` becomes 'axzzz'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is 'axzzz', `s` is '{', `s` includes 'z', and `char` is 'z'.

Output State: **`res` is 'axzzz', `s` is '{', `s` includes 'z', and `char` is 'z'**
