The code appends `char` to `res`. Since `res` is updated by appending `char`, its value will now include the previous value of `res` plus the current `char`. The state of `s` remains unchanged as it was previously updated. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `res` is updated by appending `char`; `char` is still in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `res` is updated by appending `char`; `char` is still in `s`**
