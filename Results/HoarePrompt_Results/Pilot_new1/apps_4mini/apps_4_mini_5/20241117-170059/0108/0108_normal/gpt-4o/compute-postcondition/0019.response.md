The code attempts to print the variable `target`, but `target` has not been defined in the initial state or in the provided code snippet. Therefore, an error would occur due to the undefined variable. The other variables `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unaffected by this code execution.

Output State: **`s` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, `j` is 26, `i` is the length of `s`, and an error occurs due to `target` being undefined.**
