The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1`. The previous values of the affected variables (`s`, `j`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string; `j` is less than 26; `i` is the length of `s`, which can be any non-negative integer; if `s` is empty or has no characters from the target, then `j` is 0 and `i` is 0; and the function prints -1.
