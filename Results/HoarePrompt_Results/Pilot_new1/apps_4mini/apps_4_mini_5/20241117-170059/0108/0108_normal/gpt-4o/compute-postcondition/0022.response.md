Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then `j` is 26, `i` is the length of `s`, and the function attempts to print `target`, which may lead to an error if `target` is undefined. If `s` does not contain all characters (i.e., `j` is less than 26), or if `s` is empty or has no characters from the target (resulting in `j` being 0 and `i` being 0), the function prints -1.***
