According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, and `j`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(s)` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `len(s)` is at least 1 (since `s` has a length between 1 and 100,000). 

- If `j` is 0, then it is currently less than `target_len` (which is 26), so there is no need to adjust `j`.
- If `j` is 1, it is also currently less than `target_len`, so again, there is no need to adjust `j`.
- However, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Therefore, `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is either 0 or 1**
