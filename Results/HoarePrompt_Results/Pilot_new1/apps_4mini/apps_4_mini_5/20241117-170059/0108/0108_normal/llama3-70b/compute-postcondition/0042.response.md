Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to 'z'. If the length of `res` is exactly 26, indicating that all characters from 'a' to 'z' in `s` have been replaced by their next ASCII characters, the function prints `res`. If `res` is an empty string or its length is less than 26, indicating that `s` does not contain all characters from 'a' to 'z', the function prints -1.***
