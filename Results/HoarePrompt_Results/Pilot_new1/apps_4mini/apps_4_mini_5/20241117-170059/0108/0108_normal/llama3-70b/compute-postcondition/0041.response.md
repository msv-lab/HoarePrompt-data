The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The variables `res` and `s` remain unchanged, and their states do not affect the output of the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is an empty string, the length of `res` is less than 26, and the string `s` does not contain all characters from 'a' to 'z'.

Output State: **`res` is an empty string, the length of `res` is less than 26, and the string `s` does not contain all characters from 'a' to 'z', and the function prints -1**
