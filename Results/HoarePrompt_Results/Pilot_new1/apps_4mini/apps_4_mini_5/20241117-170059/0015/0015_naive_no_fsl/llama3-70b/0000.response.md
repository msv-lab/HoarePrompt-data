Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program handles different cases:

1. **When `c == 0`**: 
   - The sequence is constant, consisting only of the value `a`. The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`, and if so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This is correct as `b` can only be part of the sequence if it equals `a`.

2. **When `c != 0`**:
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` a certain number of times. 
   - Additionally, it checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that the index `i` is a positive integer (since `i` must be a positive integer in the sequence). This condition ensures that `b` is not reached in the opposite direction of the sequence.

The program handles all edge cases outlined in the problem description correctly, including:
- The case where both `a` and `b` are equal and `c` is zero.
- The case where `b` is less than `a` when `c` is positive, and vice versa.

Therefore, I cannot find any input or potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
