Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where `c` is negative. If `c` is negative, the sequence will decrease from `a`, and we need to check if `b` is less than or equal to `a` and if `(b - a) % c == 0`. The current implementation only checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which is incorrect in this case.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 2 -1
```
In this case, the sequence would be `5, 4, 3, 2, ...`, and since `b` (which is `2`) is indeed in the sequence, the output should be "YES". However, the program will output "NO" because it incorrectly evaluates `(b - a) / c >= 0` which becomes `(2 - 5) / -1 >= 0`, or `3 >= 0`, which is true, leading to the wrong conclusion.

Thus, the program fails to consider all potential cases correctly, particularly when `c` is negative.
