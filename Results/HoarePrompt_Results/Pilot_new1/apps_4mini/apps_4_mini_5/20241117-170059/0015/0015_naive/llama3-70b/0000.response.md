To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to check if a number `b` appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference `c`.

### Program Logic:
1. If `c == 0`, the sequence is constant (all elements are equal to `a`):
   - If `a == b`, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".
   
2. If `c != 0`, we check:
   - If `(b - a) % c == 0`, it means `b` can be expressed as a term in the sequence.
   - Additionally, we check if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that `b` is reachable from `a` in a forward direction (i.e., `b` is not behind `a` in the sequence).

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: When `c` is negative and `b` is less than `a`. The program should return "YES" if `b` is reachable in the sequence, but the current implementation checks only for non-negative indices.
- **Case 2**: When `c` is positive and `b` is less than `a`, the program should return "NO", which it does correctly.
- **Case 3**: When `c` is `0`, and `a` is not equal to `b`, it correctly returns "NO".

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Let's consider the case where:
- `a = 10`
- `b = 5`
- `c = -5`

According to the sequence:
- The sequence would be: `10, 5, 0, -5, ...`
- Here, `b` (5) is indeed part of the sequence.

However, the program would evaluate:
- `(b - a) % c` which is `(5 - 10) % -5`, resulting in `-5 % -5 == 0` (which is true).
- But `(b - a) / c` evaluates to `(5 - 10) / -5` which is `-5 / -5 = 1` (which is non-negative).

The program would incorrectly print "YES", but the logic does not properly handle the case where `b` is less than `a` when `c` is negative.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the case where `c` is negative and `b` is less than `a`, resulting in incorrect output for such scenarios.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **False**.
