Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers where `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the function prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the function prints 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This covers cases where `c` is positive or negative, and ensures that the conditions regarding divisibility and the sign of the quotient are satisfied.***
