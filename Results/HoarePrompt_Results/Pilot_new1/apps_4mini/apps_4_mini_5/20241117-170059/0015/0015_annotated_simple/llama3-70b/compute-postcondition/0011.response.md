The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print function does not alter their state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the printed result.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer (not equal to 0), and the output is 'NO'**
