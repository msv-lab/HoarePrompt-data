The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is 0, and the output is 'NO'**
