Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise, the output is 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the output is 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer, including the case where `b` equals `a`. Otherwise, the output is 'NO', which includes cases where `b` is less than `a` leading to a negative difference that is not non-negative.***
