Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer, then 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, including when `(b - a)` is negative and not divisible by `c`, or when `(b - a)` is positive but not divisible by `c`, 'NO' is printed.***
