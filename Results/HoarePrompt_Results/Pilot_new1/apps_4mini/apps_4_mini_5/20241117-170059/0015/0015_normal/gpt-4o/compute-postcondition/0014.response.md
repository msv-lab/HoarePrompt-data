The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it evaluates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are integers constrained between -10^9 and 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to operate without accepting any input parameters and to return a value based on the internal logic involving `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on the internal logic involving integers a, b, and c.**
