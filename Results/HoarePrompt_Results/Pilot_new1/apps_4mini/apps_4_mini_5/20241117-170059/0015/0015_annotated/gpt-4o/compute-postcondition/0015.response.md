Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` through user input. It prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of the division is non-negative. It prints 'YES' if both conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
