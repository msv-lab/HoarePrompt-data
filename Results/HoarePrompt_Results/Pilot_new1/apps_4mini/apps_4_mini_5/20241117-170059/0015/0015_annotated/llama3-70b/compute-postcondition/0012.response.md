Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input, with `c` not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This includes cases where `(b - a)` is zero (resulting in 'YES') and cases where `(b - a)` is negative (resulting in 'NO').***
