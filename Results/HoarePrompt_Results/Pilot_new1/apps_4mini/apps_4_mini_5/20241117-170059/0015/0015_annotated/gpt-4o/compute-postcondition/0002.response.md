The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect the state of these variables. The value of `b` is equal to the value of `a`, but since the execution does not alter any variables, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with values between -10^9 and 10^9, `b` is equal to `a`, and the function prints 'YES'**
