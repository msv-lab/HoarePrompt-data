To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. You need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximal.
3. If no such sequence exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
The provided code consists of a function that computes the GCD of two numbers, `a` and `b`, using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it does not address the main requirements of the problem, which involve creating a sequence of numbers that meets the conditions specified.

### Key Points:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the GCD of `n` and `k`, but it does not help in constructing the required sequence of numbers.
2. **Sequence Construction**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of `k` numbers that sum to `n`. The provided code does not have any logic to create such a sequence.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to create the sequence, such as when `k` is greater than `n` (since the smallest possible strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers starts from 1 and sums to at least `k * (k + 1) / 2`).

### Counterexample:
For example, consider the input:
```
n = 5
k = 3
```
- The smallest strictly increasing sequence of three positive integers would be `1, 2, 3`, which sums to `6`, greater than `5`. 
- No other combination of three positive integers exists that sums to `5`.
- The program would output nothing for this scenario, which is incorrect as per the problem description (it should output `-1`).

### Conclusion:
The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it lacks the necessary logic to construct the required sequence and handle edge cases. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
