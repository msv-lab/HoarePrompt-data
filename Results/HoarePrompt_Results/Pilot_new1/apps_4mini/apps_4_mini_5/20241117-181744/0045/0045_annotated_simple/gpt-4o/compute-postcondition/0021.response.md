The value at index `i` in `sequence` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `sequence` at index `i` is not specified, but it is modified. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is now `n - d * min_sum - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.
