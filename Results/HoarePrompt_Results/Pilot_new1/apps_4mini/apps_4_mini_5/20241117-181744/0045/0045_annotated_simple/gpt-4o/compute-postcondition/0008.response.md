Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is n // min_sum, `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum, `sequence` is [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd], `i` is k - 1. The value of `remainder` is 0, indicating that `n` is exactly divisible by `min_sum`.***
