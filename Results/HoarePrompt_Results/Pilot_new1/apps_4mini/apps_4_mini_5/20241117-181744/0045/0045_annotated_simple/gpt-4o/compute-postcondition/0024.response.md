Output State: **If `remainder` is greater than 0 and `k` is at least 1, then `sequence` will have the last `k` elements incremented by 1, and `remainder` will be reduced accordingly. If `remainder` is 0 before the loop starts, the loop does not execute, and `sequence` remains as `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `sequence` remains unchanged.**
