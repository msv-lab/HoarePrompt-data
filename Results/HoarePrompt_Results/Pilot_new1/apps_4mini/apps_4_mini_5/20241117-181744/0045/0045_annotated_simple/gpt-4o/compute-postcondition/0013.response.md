According to the code, the loop iterates from `i = k - 1` down to `i = 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `k - 2` at the start of the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` remain unchanged for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd + 1]`, and `i` is `k - 2`**
