To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and the potential edge cases based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized.
3. If no such sequence exists, the program should output `-1`.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The code first checks if `n < k`. If true, it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` when `n` is less than `k`.
2. Then, it tries to create a sequence by appending integers from `1` to `k` to the list `seq` and subtracting their values from `n`.
3. If the length of `seq` is not equal to `k` after this process, it outputs `-1`.
4. If the sequence is valid, it prints the sequence.

### Potential Issues:
- The program only constructs the sequence using the first `k` positive integers (1, 2, ..., k). This does not guarantee that the GCD will be maximized, as the GCD of the sequence formed may not be optimal.
- For instance, consider the input `n = 12` and `k = 3`. The program would output `1 2 3`, which sums to `6`, but it could also form the sequence `2 4 6` which sums to `12` and has a GCD of `2`, which is higher than `1`.
- Moreover, the program does not handle cases where the sum of the first `k` integers (which is `k * (k + 1) / 2`) exceeds `n`.

### Example Case:
For `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the program outputs `1 2 3`, which sums to `6`. This is incorrect because we can have `2 4 6` which sums to `12` and has a higher GCD. 

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly maximize the GCD and does not cover all potential cases, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
