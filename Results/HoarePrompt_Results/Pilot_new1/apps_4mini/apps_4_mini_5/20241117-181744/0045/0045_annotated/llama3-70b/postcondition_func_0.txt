The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be any integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is 0 at the start, it returns the initial value of `a`. If `b` is not 0, it swaps the values of `a` and `b` repeatedly until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the last non-zero value of `a`.
