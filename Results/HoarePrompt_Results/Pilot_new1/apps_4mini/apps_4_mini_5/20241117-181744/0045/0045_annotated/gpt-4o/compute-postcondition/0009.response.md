The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is 0, `sequence` is [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd], `i` is k - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
