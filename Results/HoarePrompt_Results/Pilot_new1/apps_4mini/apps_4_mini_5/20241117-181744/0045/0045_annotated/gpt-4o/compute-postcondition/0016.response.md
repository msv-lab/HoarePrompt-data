The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 for `i` equal to `k - 2`. The previous state of `sequence[i]` is not specified, but it will increase by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 for `i` equal to `k - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 for `i` equal to `k - 2**
