The variable `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, where `//` denotes integer division. The values of `n` and `min_sum` are known, with `min_sum` being calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The previous state indicates that `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, so the division will yield a non-negative integer. The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `min_sum`, and the newly computed value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`.**
