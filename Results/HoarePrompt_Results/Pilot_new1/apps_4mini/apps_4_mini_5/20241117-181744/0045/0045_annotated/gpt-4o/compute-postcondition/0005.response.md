To analyze the provided code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the impact of the code:

1. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, and `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, which gives the number of times `min_sum` fits into `n`.

2. The code snippet `remainder = n - d * min_sum` calculates the remainder when `n` is reduced by the total of `d` times `min_sum`.

3. The values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum` are used in this calculation, but the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `remainder` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum` without changing any of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.**
