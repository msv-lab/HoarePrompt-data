The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, the function calculates `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum sum required cannot be achieved with the given `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, implying that the conditions for returning -1 were not met.

In Case 2, if the conditions of Case 1 are satisfied (i.e., `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`), the function returns a modified sequence where the last `min(remainder, k)` elements are incremented by 1, if `remainder` is greater than 0; otherwise, the sequence remains unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, check if the minimum sum required can be achieved with `n`, and either return -1 if it cannot or return a modified sequence based on the conditions described. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It returns -1 if the minimum sum required cannot be achieved with `n`; otherwise, it returns a modified sequence based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
