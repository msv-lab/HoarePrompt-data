According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop starts with `i` equal to `k - 1` and decrements `i` with each iteration until it reaches -1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been decremented by 1, so it is currently `k - 1 - 1 = k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `k - 2` at the start of the next iteration. 

Since the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted to `k - 2` and remains within the bounds of the loop. 

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to `k - 2` to allow for another iteration of the loop.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence[i]` are not affected by the loop's continuation in this context.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`**
