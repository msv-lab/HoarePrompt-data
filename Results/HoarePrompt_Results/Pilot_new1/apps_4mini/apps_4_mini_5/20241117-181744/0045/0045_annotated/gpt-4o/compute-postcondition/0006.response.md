To analyze the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state of the variables:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`.
- `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.

Now, we execute the code snippet:

```python
sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
```

The code creates a list called `sequence`. It iterates over a range of `k`, which means it will run `k` times, generating a sequence of values based on `d` and the index `i`. Specifically, for each index `i` from `0` to `k-1`, it calculates `d * (i + 1)`.

1. The first element in `sequence` will be `d * (0 + 1)`, which is `d`.
2. The second element will be `d * (1 + 1)`, which is `2d`.
3. Continuing this pattern, the last element (the k-th element) will be `d * (k + 1)`.

Thus, the resulting list `sequence` will contain the first `k` multiples of `d`:

- `sequence = [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`

Since the values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` are not changed by this operation, we summarize the output state:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]**
