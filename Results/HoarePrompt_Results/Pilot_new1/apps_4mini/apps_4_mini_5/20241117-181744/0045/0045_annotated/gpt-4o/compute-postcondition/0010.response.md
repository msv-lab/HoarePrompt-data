Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`. If `remainder` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the sequence `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]` is perfectly divisible by `min_sum`. If `remainder` is not 0, the program continues without breaking, implying that the sequence does not satisfy the condition for termination.***
