The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `sequence[k - 1]` is increased by 1, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
