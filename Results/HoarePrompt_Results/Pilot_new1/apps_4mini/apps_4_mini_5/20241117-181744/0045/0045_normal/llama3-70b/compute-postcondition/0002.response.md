The code assigns the value of `b` to `a` and the value of `a % b` to `b`. Since `a` is not equal to `b`, the operation `a % b` will yield a value that is less than `b`. Therefore, after the execution, `a` will hold the previous value of `b`, and `b` will hold the remainder of the division of the previous `a` by the previous `b`. The specific values of `a` and `b` are not known, but we can express the output state based on their relationship.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10; `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and `a` is not equal to `b`.**
