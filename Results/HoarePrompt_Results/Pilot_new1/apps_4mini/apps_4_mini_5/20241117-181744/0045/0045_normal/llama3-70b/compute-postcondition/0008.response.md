The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. If `b` is greater than 0, the function returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, the function returns the unchanged value of `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the GCD of `a` and `b` if `b` is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns the value of `a` unchanged if `b` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, returns the GCD of `a` and `b` if `b` is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns the unchanged value of `a` if `b` is 0.**
