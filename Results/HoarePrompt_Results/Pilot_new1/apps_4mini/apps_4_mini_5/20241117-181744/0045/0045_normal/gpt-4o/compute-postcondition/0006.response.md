The variable `sequence` is assigned a list comprehension that generates a sequence based on the values of `d` and `k`. Specifically, it creates a list where each element is calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `k-1`. The previous values of `d` and `k` are used to compute the sequence.

Given that `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum` and `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, the values of `d` and `k` will determine the contents of the list. The variable `sequence` thus contains `k` elements, each being a multiple of `d`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list of `k` elements calculated from `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list of `k` elements calculated from `d`.**
