The `remainder` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is not specified, but it is known to be a non-negative integer since it is calculated from `n` and `min_sum`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.**
