Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0 at the start, it returns the unchanged value of `a`. If `b` is non-zero, it computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, which continues until `b` becomes 0. Thus, it effectively handles cases where `b` is initially zero or positive. **
