According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be `0` after the loop completes its execution. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 1`, since the loop decrements `i` in each iteration. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer and does not affect the loop's ability to execute again. 

Since the loop iterates in reverse, for it to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is reset to `k - 1`. There are no other states that need to be adjusted based on the provided information.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is k - 1**
