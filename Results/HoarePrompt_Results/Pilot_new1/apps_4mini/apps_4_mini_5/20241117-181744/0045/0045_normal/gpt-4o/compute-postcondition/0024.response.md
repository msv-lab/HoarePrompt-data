Output State: **`sequence` will have its last elements increased by 1 for each decrement of `remainder` until `remainder` is 0 or `i` reaches -1. If `remainder` is initially 0, the loop does not execute, and `sequence` remains unchanged. If `k` is 1, the loop will execute a maximum of 1 time, and `sequence[0]` will be increased by `remainder` if `remainder` is greater than 0.**
