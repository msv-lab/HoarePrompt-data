To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers such that their sum equals `n`, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized. If no such sequence exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    seq = []
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if n >= i:
            seq.append(i)
            n -= i
        else:
            break
    if len(seq) != k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, seq)))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Initial Check**: If `n < k`, it immediately prints `-1`, since it's impossible to create a sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` if `n` is smaller than `k`.
3. **Building the Sequence**: A loop runs from `1` to `k`, attempting to create a sequence by appending integers `1` to `k` to the list `seq` as long as `n` is sufficient to cover the sum. 
4. **Validation**: After the loop, if the length of `seq` is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the sequence.

### Edge Cases:
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the sequence will be `[1, 2, ..., k]` which sums to `k` and is valid.
- If `n` is much larger than `k`, the program does not attempt to maximize the GCD; it simply returns the first `k` integers, which may not yield the largest GCD.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe a function that calculates the GCD of two numbers, which is not directly relevant to the sequence generation logic. The hints do not address the requirement of maximizing the GCD of the sequence, which is a critical aspect of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the requirement of maximizing the GCD. For example, if `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the program would output `1 2 3` which sums to `6` and has a GCD of `1`. However, a better sequence could be `2 4 6`, which also sums to `12` but has a GCD of `2`. 

Since the program fails to produce a valid output for cases where the GCD can be maximized, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
