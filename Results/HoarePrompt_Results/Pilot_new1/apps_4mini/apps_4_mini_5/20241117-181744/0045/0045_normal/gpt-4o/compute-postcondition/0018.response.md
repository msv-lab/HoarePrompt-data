According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer, which means `k - 1` is at least `0`. Since `sequence[k - 1]` was increased by 1 and `remainder` was decreased by 1, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next iteration of the loop.

The last value of `i` was `k - 1`, and after the last iteration, `i` would be decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `k - 2`. Since `k` is a positive integer, `k - 2` will also be a valid index as long as `k` is greater than `1`.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `i` should be `k - 2`
- `sequence[k - 1]` remains increased by 1 (no change needed)
- `remainder` is decreased by 1 (no change needed)

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `sequence[k - 1]` is increased by 1, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`**
