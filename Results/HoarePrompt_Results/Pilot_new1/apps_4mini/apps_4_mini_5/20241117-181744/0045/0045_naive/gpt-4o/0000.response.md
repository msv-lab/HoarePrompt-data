To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sums up to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized.
3. If no such sequence exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1(n, k)` implements the following logic:
1. It calculates the minimum sum required to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers, which is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
2. If this minimum sum is greater than `n`, it returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to form such a sequence.
3. It calculates how many times this minimum sum can fit into `n` (stored in `d`).
4. It constructs a sequence by multiplying each index by `d`, starting from `1` to `k`.
5. It then distributes any leftover from `n` (after subtracting the sum of the sequence) by incrementing the last elements of the sequence until the remainder is exhausted.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program does not ensure that the sequence remains strictly increasing after adjusting the last elements with the remainder. For example, if `d` is `1` and `k` is `3`, the sequence starts as `[1, 2, 3]`. If the remainder is `1`, the sequence becomes `[1, 2, 4]`, which is still valid. However, if the remainder is `2`, it becomes `[1, 2, 5]`, which is also valid. But if the initial sequence was `[1, 2, 3]` and `d` was `2`, the sequence would start as `[2, 4, 6]`. If the remainder is `1`, it would become `[2, 4, 7]`, which is valid, but if it was `0`, it would remain `[2, 4, 6]`, which is still valid. 

2. The program does not handle cases where distributing the remainder might lead to non-distinct or non-increasing sequences. For instance, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is `6` (from `1 + 2 + 3`). If `d = 1`, the sequence would be `[1, 2, 3]`, and if `d = 2`, it would be `[2, 4, 6]`. If we have a remainder of `4`, we could potentially end up with `[2, 4, 10]`, which is not strictly increasing.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be `[1]`, which is handled correctly.
- For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the output should be `-1`, which is also handled correctly.
- For `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the output should be `[1, 2, 7]` or similar valid sequences, which the program might not generate correctly if the remainder is not handled properly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the sequence will always be strictly increasing after the adjustments with the remainder. Thus, it may fail for some inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
