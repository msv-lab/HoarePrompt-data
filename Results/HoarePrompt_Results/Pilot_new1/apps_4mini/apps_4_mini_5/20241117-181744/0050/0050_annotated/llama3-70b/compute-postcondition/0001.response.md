The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate values. The initial state of `n`, `m`, and `r` does not affect the creation of the list `s`, as it solely depends on the input provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` is now a list of integers created from the input values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input values**
