The code `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. The output state will reflect the sorted state of the list `s`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a sorted list of integers; `b` is a list of integers from input values**
