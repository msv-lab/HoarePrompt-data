Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as the smallest value in `s`. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by `shares * b[0]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `r` unchanged and `shares` unchanged.***
