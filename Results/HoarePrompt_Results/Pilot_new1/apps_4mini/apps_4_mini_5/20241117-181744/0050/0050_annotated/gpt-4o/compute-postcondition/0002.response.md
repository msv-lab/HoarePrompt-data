The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`, which means it will contain integers based on user input. The initial state of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` is unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `b` is now a list of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers based on user input; `s` is a list of integers based on user input; `b` is a list of integers based on user input.**
