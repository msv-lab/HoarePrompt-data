According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, it's stated that `i` is the current value + 1 and must remain less than `m` for the loop to continue. 

Since `shares` is greater than 0, `r` has been updated, and `shares` has been set to 0. The next iteration will depend on the updated value of `i`, which is now the current value + 1.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be the next value, which will be `current value + 1`, and ensure that `m` is greater than this new value of `i`. 

Thus, we need to set `i` to the updated value and ensure that `m` is greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is at least as large as the smallest value in `s`, `i` is the current value + 1, `m` is greater than `i`**
