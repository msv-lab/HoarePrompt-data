The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The previous state of `b` is not provided, but it now holds a list of integers based on the input. The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned input integers; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers created from input.**
