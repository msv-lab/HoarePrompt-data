The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values received from `input().split()`. The exact values of `b` will depend on the input provided, but it will be a list of integers. The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the new list `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input.**
