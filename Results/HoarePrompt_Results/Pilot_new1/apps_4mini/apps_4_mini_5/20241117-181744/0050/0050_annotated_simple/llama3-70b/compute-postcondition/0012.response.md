Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, and `shares` is updated by adding `r // s[i]` while `r` is updated to `r % s[i]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop is exited, and `shares` remains unchanged at 0, with `r` retaining its original value.***
