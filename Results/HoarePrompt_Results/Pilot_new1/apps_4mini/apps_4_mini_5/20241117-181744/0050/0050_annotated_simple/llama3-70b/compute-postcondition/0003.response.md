The `s` list is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation, and the contents of `b` remain unchanged as well. The output state reflects the sorted state of `s`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input**.
