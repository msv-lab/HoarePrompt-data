The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The output of the function is not specified in the given information, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the provided details. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined due to the lack of output information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly, but it operates under the constraints that x and y are integers with 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value is not specified.**
