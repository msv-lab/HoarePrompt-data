The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given that `x` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 100000, and `y` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x`, we can conclude that the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` will be a positive integer since `x` is always greater than `y`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `x` and `y`, along with the printed result of their absolute difference.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 100000; `y` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x`; and the output is abs(x - y)**
