The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as its signature indicates no input parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers with the conditions that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function's output is not specified in the provided details. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently unclear without knowing what it returns based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value is unspecified.**
