The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value or any cases based on the output criteria. Therefore, we can only state the constraints on `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function operates with the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but does not accept parameters or specify a return value.**
