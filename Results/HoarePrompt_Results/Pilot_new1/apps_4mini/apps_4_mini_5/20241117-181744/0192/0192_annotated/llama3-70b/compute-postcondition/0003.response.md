Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` as input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. However, it does not enforce any constraints on the values of `x` and `y`, meaning it can accept any integers, not just those where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 as stated in the annotations. **
