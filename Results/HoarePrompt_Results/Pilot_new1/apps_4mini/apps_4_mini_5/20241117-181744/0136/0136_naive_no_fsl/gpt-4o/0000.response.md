Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where both input integers are zero correctly. According to the problem description, if both input integers are "0" (or have leading zeros that would be stripped to "0"), the program should output "=". However, if both inputs are "0000", the program will strip the leading zeros and set both `a` and `b` to an empty string before replacing them with '0'. This part works correctly, but it will not print anything if both `a` and `b` are equal to '0' because the conditions for printing are not reached.

For example, if the input is:
```
0000
0000
```
The output will be empty, which is incorrect as it should print "=".

Thus, the program fails to handle this edge case correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
