Functionality: ** The function reads two non-negative integers as strings from user input, removes any leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first integer is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either integer is empty after removing leading zeros, it is treated as '0'. The function handles integers with up to 10^6 digits. **
