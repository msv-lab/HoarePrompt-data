To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description, while considering the annotations as well.

### Problem Description
The program must:
1. Read two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from input, which can contain leading zeroes.
2. Compare these integers and print:
   - `<` if `a < b`
   - `>` if `a > b`
   - `=` if `a == b`

### Code Analysis
1. The program reads input using `input().split()`, which correctly handles reading both integers at once.
2. It removes leading zeros from both integers using `lstrip('0')`.
3. If after removing leading zeros, either `a` or `b` is empty, it assigns '0' to that variable.
4. The program then compares the lengths of `a` and `b`:
   - If `len(a) < len(b)`, it prints `<`.
   - If `len(a) > len(b)`, it prints `>`.
   - If the lengths are equal, it performs a lexicographical comparison of `a` and `b`.

### Edge Cases Consideration
- The program correctly handles the case where both numbers are equal after stripping leading zeros.
- It also correctly identifies cases where one number is longer than the other, thus determining which is greater without needing to compare the actual numeric values directly.
- The handling of leading zeros is appropriate, as both '00012345' and '12345' will result in '12345', making them equal.

### Annotations Review
The annotations explain that:
- `a` and `b` are compared after leading zeros are stripped.
- The program correctly checks for cases where either number might be empty after stripping zeros, treating such cases as '0'.
- The logic for comparing lengths and values is clearly laid out, confirming that all potential cases are covered.

### Conclusion
The code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles all edge cases effectively. There are no identified scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
