The code takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variables `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this operation, but the new variable `data` will hold the resulting list of strings. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, they may be included in the input, but their specific values are not known at this point.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings; `data` is a list of substrings obtained from the input.**
