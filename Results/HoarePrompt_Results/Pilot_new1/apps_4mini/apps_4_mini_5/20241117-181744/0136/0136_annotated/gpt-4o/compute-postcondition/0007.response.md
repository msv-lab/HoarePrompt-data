The value of `b` is assigned the string `'0'`. The variable `a` remains unchanged, whether it was originally a string representing a non-negative integer or set to `'0'`. The variable `data` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros (or '0' if originally empty), `b` is '0', and `data` is a list of substrings.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros (or '0' if originally empty), `b` is '0', and `data` is a list of substrings.**
