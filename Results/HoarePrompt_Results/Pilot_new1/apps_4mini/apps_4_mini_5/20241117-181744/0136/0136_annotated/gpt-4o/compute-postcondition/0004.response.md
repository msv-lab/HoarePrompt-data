The value of `a` is assigned the string `'0'`, which means `a` is now `'0'`. The other variables `b` and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is `'0'`, `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and `data` is a list of substrings.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and `data` is a list of substrings**
