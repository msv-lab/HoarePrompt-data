Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input (provided as strings), compares them after stripping leading zeroes, and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The function does not return any value, and it handles cases where both inputs are zero or any other non-negative integers represented as strings. **
