The `data` variable is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which takes an input string, splits it into a list based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `data`. The values of `a` and `b` are not changed by this operation, and since they are non-negative integers represented as strings, they remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the unchanged values of `a` and `b`, and indicate that `data` now holds a list of strings resulting from the input split.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer string, `b` is a non-negative integer string, and `data` is a list of strings from input**
