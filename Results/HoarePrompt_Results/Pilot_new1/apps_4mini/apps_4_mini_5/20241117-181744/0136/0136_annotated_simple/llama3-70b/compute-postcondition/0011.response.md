The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates on two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, which are represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes. Each string can have up to 10^6 digits. 

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior of the function based on the given constraints and relationships.
