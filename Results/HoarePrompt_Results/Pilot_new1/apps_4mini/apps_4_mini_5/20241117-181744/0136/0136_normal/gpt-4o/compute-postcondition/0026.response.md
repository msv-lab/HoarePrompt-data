The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits, and they may include leading zeroes. The function processes these string representations of integers and returns their sum as a string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and return their sum as a string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, both non-negative integers represented as strings, and returns their sum as a string.**
