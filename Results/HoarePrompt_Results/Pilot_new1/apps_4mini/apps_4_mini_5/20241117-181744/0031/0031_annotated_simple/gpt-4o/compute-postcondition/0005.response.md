The value of `total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). Since the initial state indicates that there is no output or return statement executed unless \(k > 2^n\), we need to consider the implications of calculating \(total_days\) in relation to \(k\). 

- If \(k\) is greater than \(2^n\), the program would have printed (1, 1) and returned, but since we are only calculating `total_days` now, we will not consider the case for output or return.
- The value of `total_days` is computed as \(2^n\) based on the left shift operation.

Since \(k\) is not affecting the computation of `total_days`, and the output state does not include any print or return statements, the state of the variables before and after remains unchanged except for the new variable `total_days`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `total_days` is \(2^n\)**
