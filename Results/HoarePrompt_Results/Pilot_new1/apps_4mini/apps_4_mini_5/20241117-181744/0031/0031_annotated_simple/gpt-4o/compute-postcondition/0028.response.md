The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the function prints (1, 1) and terminates without returning any value. If `k` is not greater than `2^n`, there is no output or return statement executed. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and if `k` exceeds `2^n`, it prints (1, 1); otherwise, it does nothing. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than `2^n`; otherwise, it performs no output or return.**
