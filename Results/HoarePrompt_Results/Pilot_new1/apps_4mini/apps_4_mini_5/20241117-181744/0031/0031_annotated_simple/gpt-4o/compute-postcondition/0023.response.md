The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`. The variable `A` retains its value of `p_shared`, and the state of `p_total` is not specified, so it remains unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `A` is equal to `p_shared`, and `B` is equal to `p_total`.

Output State: **`A` is equal to `p_shared`, `B` is equal to `p_total`**
