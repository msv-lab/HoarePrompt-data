The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. Since `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, the new value of `denominator` will be `1 * 2^n`, which simplifies to `2^n`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 2^n, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 2^n, `i` is 0**
