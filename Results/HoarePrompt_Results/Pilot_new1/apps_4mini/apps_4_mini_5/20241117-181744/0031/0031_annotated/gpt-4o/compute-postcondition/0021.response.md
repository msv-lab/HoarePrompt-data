To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, which is 1 if `k` is 0, or the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` modulo `MOD` if `k` is greater than 0.
- `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.

The code snippet:
```
p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `p_total` is determined by the initial state (denominator).
2. The value of `p_no_shared` is determined based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k` is 0, then `p_no_shared` is 1.
   - If `k` is greater than 0, `p_no_shared` is the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` modulo `MOD`.
3. The expression `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD` calculates `p_shared`. This calculation ensures that the result is non-negative by adding `MOD` before taking the modulo.

Since we don't have specific values for `numerator`, `denominator`, `total_days`, `k`, or `MOD`, we cannot calculate exact numerical values for `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, or `p_shared`. However, we can describe their relationships.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either 1 or the product of (total_days - i) for i from 0 to k-1 modulo MOD; `p_total` is the value of denominator; `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD**.
