The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days - i`. The previous value of `numerator` is 1, `total_days` is `2**n`, and `i` is 0. Therefore, the calculation for `numerator` becomes:

```
numerator = 1 * (total_days - 0) = 1 * total_days = total_days
```

Since `total_days` is `2**n`, the new value of `numerator` will be `2**n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
