The code prints the values `1` and `1`. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the printed output is (1, 1)**
