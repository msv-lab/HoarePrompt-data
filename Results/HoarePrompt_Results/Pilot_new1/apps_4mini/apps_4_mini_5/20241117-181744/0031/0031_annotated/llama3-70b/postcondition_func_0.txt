The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the numerator as the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`, and the denominator as `2^(n * k)`. It then reduces both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD) and returns their values modulo 1000003. The function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 2, which would result in the numerator and denominator remaining 1, leading to a return of (1, 1) in such cases.
