The `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is \(2^n\), and the initial value of `denominator` is 1. Therefore, after executing the code, the new value of `denominator` will be \(1 \times 2^n = 2^n\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 0**
