The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, it returns the remainder of `n` when divided by 1000003 and the remainder of `k` when divided by 1000003. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return their remainders when divided by 1000003.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, and returns the remainder of n when divided by 1000003 and the remainder of k when divided by 1000003.**
