The function accepts two integers `n` (where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18) and `k` (where 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18). If `k` exceeds `2^n`, it prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates the probability of selecting `k` items from `2^n` items without replacement, and prints the reduced fraction of shared selections over total selections modulo 10^6 + 3. The function does not handle cases where `k` is zero or negative, nor does it return any value; it only prints the results.
