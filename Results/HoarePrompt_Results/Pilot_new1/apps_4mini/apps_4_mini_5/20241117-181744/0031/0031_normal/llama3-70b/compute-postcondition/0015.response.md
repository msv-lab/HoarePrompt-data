The value of `numerator` is divided by `gcd`. Given the initial state, if `k` is 2, then `gcd` is 2, and if `k` is greater than 2, then `gcd` is 8. However, the initial value of `numerator` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `numerator`. The output state will reflect the operation performed.

Output State: **`numerator` is divided by `gcd`, resulting in `numerator //= gcd` where `gcd` is either 2 or 8 depending on the value of `k**.
