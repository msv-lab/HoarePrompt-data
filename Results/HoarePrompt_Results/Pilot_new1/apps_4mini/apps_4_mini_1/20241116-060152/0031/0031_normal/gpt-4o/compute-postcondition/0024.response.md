Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is `total_days^k` modulo `MOD`, `total_days` is `2^n`, `k` is at least 2, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and the function `func_1` is called with arguments `A` and `B`, resulting in `g` being assigned the return value of `func_1(A, B)`.**
