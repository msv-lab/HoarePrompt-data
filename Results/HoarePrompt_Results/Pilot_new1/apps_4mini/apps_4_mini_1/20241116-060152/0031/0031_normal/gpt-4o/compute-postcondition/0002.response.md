The code prints the values `1` and `1`. The state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD` is not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `n`, `k`, and `MOD`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003, and the function prints 1, 1**.
