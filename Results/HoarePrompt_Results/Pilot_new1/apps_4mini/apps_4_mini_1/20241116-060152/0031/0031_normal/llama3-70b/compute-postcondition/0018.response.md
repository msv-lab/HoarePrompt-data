The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, if `k` is at least 1, the function returns the tuple (0, 1). If `k` is 0 or negative, the function returns the tuple (1, 1). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return (0, 1) if `k` is at least 1, or (1, 1) if `k` is 0 or negative. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, returns (0, 1) if k is at least 1, or (1, 1) if k is 0 or negative.**
