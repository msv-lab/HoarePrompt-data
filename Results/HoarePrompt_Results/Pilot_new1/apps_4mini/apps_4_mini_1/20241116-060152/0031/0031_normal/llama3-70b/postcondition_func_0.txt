The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the total number of days as \(2^n\). If `k` is at least 1, it computes the numerator as the product of \(2^n - i\) for `i` from 0 to `k-1`, and the denominator as \(2^n\) raised to the power of `k`. The function then reduces the fraction formed by the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD) and returns the numerator and denominator modulo \(10^6 + 3\). If `k` is 0 or negative, the function returns (1, 1). Thus, the function returns (0, 1) if `k` is at least 1, or (1, 1) if `k` is 0 or negative.
