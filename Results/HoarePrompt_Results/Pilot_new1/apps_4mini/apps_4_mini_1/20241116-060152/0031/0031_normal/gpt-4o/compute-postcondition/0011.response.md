According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which is less than `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The variables `n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n % MOD, `denominator` is 2^n % MOD, `i` is 1**
