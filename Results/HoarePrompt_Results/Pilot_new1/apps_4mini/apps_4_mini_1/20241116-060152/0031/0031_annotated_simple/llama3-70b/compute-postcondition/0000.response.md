`total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^18. The specific value of `total_days` will depend on the value of `n`, which is not specified in this case. Therefore, the output state reflects that `total_days` is a power of 2 based on the value of `n`. The other variable `k` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 ** n**
