According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `k` must be greater than 3. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `k` accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that k is greater than 3, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 8, `i` is 3**
