The code modifies the value of `denominator` by performing an integer division with `gcd`. The initial value of `denominator` is \(2^k\) and `gcd` is also \(2^k\). Therefore, after executing the code, `denominator` will be assigned the value \(2^k // 2^k\), which equals 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 1, `gcd` is \(2^k\)**
