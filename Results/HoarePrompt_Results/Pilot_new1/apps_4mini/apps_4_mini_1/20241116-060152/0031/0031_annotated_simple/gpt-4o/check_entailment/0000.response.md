To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step, considering the requirements specified.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: Two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. The number of days in a year is `2^n`.
2. **Output**: The probability that at least two of the `k` people have the same birthday expressed as an irreducible fraction `A/B`, printed modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the GCD of `a` and `b`. It is correctly implemented and will be used later to reduce `A` and `B`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - It first checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If true, it prints `1 1`, which is correct since if there are more people than days, at least two must share a birthday.
   - It calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 1 << n` (which is `2^n`).
   - It initializes `numerator` and `denominator` to 1.
   - A loop runs `k` times to compute:
     - `numerator`: the product of available days for each subsequent person.
     - `denominator`: the total number of possible combinations of birthdays.
   - After the loop, it computes the probability of at least one shared birthday:
     - `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.
   - The values of `A` and `B` are set to `p_shared` and `p_total`, respectively.
   - It reduces `A` and `B` by their GCD and prints the results modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Edge Cases
- The program correctly handles the case where `k > 2^n` by returning `1 1`.
- The calculation of the numerator and denominator appears correct for `k <= 2^n`.

### Potential Issues
1. **Large Values**: The operations on large integers (up to `10^18`) may lead to performance issues, but Python can handle large integers natively.
2. **Reduction of A and B**: The reduction step using GCD is correct, and the modulo operation is applied after ensuring `A` and `B` are coprime.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis above, the code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately. I cannot find any specific case where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
