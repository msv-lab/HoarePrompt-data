To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and flow of the code.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the probability that at least two out of `k` people share a birthday when there are `2^n` possible birthdays. The result should be expressed as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where both \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime.

### Code Analysis
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    total_days = 2 ** n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator *= total_days - i
        denominator *= total_days
        
    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    return numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)
```

1. **Initialization**: The program calculates `total_days` as \( 2^n \). The `numerator` and `denominator` are initialized to 1.
  
2. **Loop**: The loop runs `k` times. In each iteration:
   - The `numerator` is multiplied by \( \text{total_days} - i \), which represents the number of ways to assign birthdays without a conflict.
   - The `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, representing all possible assignments of birthdays.

3. **GCD Calculation**: After the loop, the program calculates the GCD of `numerator` and `denominator` and reduces both by this GCD.

4. **Return Values**: Finally, the function returns the reduced `numerator` and `denominator` modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Potential Issues
1. **Handling Large Values**: The loop runs `k` times, and since `k` can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), the calculations for `numerator` and `denominator` may overflow or become impractical to compute in a reasonable timeframe or without hitting memory limits.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If \( k > 2^n \), it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, leading to a probability of \( 1 \) (i.e., \( \frac{1}{1} \)).
   - If \( k \) is very large relative to \( n \), the program does not handle these cases correctly since the loop will attempt to compute values that are not feasible.

3. **Final GCD Reduction**: The reduction of `numerator` and `denominator` by their GCD assumes both are non-zero. If `numerator` becomes zero due to multiplication (which could happen if `total_days` is small), the GCD calculation and subsequent division could lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion
The code does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when \( k \) exceeds \( 2^n \) or is very large. This leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
