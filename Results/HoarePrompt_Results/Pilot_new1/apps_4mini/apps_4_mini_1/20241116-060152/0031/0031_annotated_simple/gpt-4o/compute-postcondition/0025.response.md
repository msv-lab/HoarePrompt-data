The value of `A` is divided by `g`, which is the return value from the function `func_1(A, B)`. The previous value of `A` is `p_shared`, but the exact value of `g` is not known since it depends on the implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, the output state must reflect that `A` is updated based on this division, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is updated to `A // g`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is (2^n)^k % MOD, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the return value of `func_1(A, B)`**
