The loop multiplies the `numerator` by `total_days - i` and the `denominator` by `total_days` for `k` iterations. 

If `k` is greater than `total_days`, the loop will still execute `k` times, but the calculations will involve negative values for `numerator` as `total_days - i` will become negative for some iterations. 

If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute, and both `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1.

Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes k times, numerator is the product of (2^n) * (2^n - 1) * (2^n - 2) * ... * (2^n - (k-1)), and denominator is (2^n)^k. If k is 0, numerator is 1 and denominator is 1. If k is greater than 2^n, numerator will contain negative values for some iterations.**
