According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `denominator` is \((2^n) \mod MOD\), `i` is 1, `numerator` is (2**1)**
