Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator` if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `p_no_shared` is assigned the value 1; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; `A` is updated to A // g; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`; `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`; `B` is updated to B // g.**
