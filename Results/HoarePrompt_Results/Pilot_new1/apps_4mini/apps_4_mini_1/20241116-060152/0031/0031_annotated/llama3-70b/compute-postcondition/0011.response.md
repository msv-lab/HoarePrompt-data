The variable `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is `2^n`, so after the execution, `denominator` will be updated to `denominator * total_days`, which equals `denominator * (2^n)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n; `numerator` is (2^n * (2^n - 1)) * (2^n - 2); `denominator` is the previous value multiplied by 2^n; `i` is 2; `k` is greater than 2**
