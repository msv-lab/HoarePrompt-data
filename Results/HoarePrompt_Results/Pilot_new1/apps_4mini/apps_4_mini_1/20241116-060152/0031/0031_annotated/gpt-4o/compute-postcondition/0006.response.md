The variable `numerator` is assigned the value of `1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `total_days` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, and `numerator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, and `numerator` is 1**
