To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations step by step.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. We have `2^n` days in a year.
2. We want to interview `k` people, each with a birthday on one of these days.
3. We need to calculate the probability that at least two of the `k` people share a birthday.
4. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$, where A and B are coprime, and both should be printed modulo $10^6 + 3$.

### Code Analysis:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Computes the GCD of two numbers.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Handles the main logic of calculating the probability.

#### Key Logic in `func_2`:
1. **Checking for `k > 2^n`**: If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the program correctly outputs `(1, 1)` because it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday.
2. **Calculating Probabilities**:
   - It calculates the numerator as the product of available days for each person (i.e., `total_days - i` for each `i` from `0` to `k-1`).
   - The denominator is simply `total_days^k`.
   - It computes the probability of no shared birthdays and then derives the probability of at least one shared birthday.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `k > 2^n` correctly.
- However, when `k <= 2^n`, there is a potential issue. The calculation of probabilities assumes that `k` can be less than or equal to `2^n` but does not handle the case where `k` is very large relative to `n` properly, specifically for large values of `n` and `k`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Overflow and Modulo Handling**: Given that `n` and `k` can be as large as `10^18`, the calculations for `numerator` and `denominator` could lead to overflow issues before the modulo operation is applied. The calculations may not be feasible for large `k` values.
2. **Output Format**: The program does not ensure that the output is in the correct format for all cases, especially when reducing the fraction. If `A` and `B` are not coprime before applying modulo, the output may not be valid.

### Conclusion:
The code does not guarantee correctness across all potential edge cases, especially for large values of `n` and `k`. The handling of probabilities and the reduction of the fraction may not work as expected in every situation, particularly due to the constraints on large integers.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Example Case of Failure:
For example, if we input `n = 60` and `k = 100`:
- `2^60` is a very large number, and the calculations involved in `numerator` and `denominator` may not be handled correctly, leading to incorrect outputs or overflow before applying modulo. The program does not explicitly handle large integer arithmetic or check for coprimality post-modulo, which could lead to incorrect results.
