The value of `total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). The initial state specifies that `k` is an integer that is either greater than or less than/equal to \(2^n\). However, without knowing the specific values of `n` and `k`, we cannot determine the exact output of `total_days`. 

Assuming \(2^n\) is calculated correctly, the state of the variables is affected only by the assignment of `total_days`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation of `total_days` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
