The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `denominator`. The previous values of the affected variables are `denominator` which is now set to `1`, while `n`, `k`, `total_days`, and `numerator` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1**
