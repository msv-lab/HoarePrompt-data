To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it handles all potential edge cases as described in the problem statement.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The program is supposed to calculate the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday among `2^n` days, given `k` people. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction A/B, where A and B are coprime, and both values are to be printed modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

2. **Key Points in the Code**:
   - The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct for reducing the fraction.
   - The function `func_2` checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If so, it immediately returns `1, 1`, which is correct since if there are more people than days, at least one birthday must be shared.
   - The calculations for the numerator and denominator are done in a loop that iterates `k` times, correctly calculating the number of ways to pick `k` birthdays without sharing.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case when `k = 1`. In this case, the probability of sharing a birthday is 0, and the output should be `0 B` where B is the total number of days (not `1, 1`).
   - The program also does not handle the case when `n` is very large, which could lead to overflow issues with calculations. However, since the calculations are done modulo \(10^6 + 3\), this may be mitigated.

4. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the expected output should be `0 2` (since the probability of sharing a birthday is 0), but the program does not handle this case correctly.
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the program outputs `1 1`, which is correct since at least two people will share a birthday, but the program's logic for `k = 1` is flawed.

Since the program fails to correctly handle the case when `k = 1`, the overall correctness is impacted.

Correctness: **False**
