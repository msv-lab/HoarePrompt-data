Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the absolute difference between the starting triangle side length `x` and the target triangle side length `y` using `abs(x - y)`. However, this approach does not take into account the requirement that the triangle must remain non-degenerate at all times during the modification process.

To illustrate this, consider the input case:
```
Input:
7 5
```
According to the problem, starting from an equilateral triangle of side length `7`, Memory can perform the following steps to reach side length `5` while maintaining the triangle's non-degenerate property:
1. (7, 7, 7) → (7, 7, 6) → (7, 6, 6) → (6, 6, 6) → (5, 5, 5)

This involves 4 seconds of modification. However, the program would output `abs(7 - 5)`, which is `2`, indicating that only 2 seconds are needed, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate during the transformation process, leading to an incorrect result for certain inputs.
