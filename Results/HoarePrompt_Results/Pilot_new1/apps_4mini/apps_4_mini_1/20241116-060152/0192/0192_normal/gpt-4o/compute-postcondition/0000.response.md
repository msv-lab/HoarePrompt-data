The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input received, which are integers within the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The previous values of `x` and `y` are not specified, as they will be replaced by the user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` and `y` are now assigned new integer values based on the input. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are new integers based on input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
