Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, where it is expected that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It calculates and prints the result of the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. There are no checks for the input constraints, so if the input does not meet the expected conditions, the behavior is undefined. **
