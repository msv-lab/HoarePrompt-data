Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged with `i` being 0. If `remainder` equals 0, the loop is exited; otherwise, the program continues execution with `remainder` still decreased by 1.***
