To calculate the value of `min_sum`, we use the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range specified, we can determine that `min_sum` will be assigned the value based on the current value of `k`.

The output state will reflect the assignment of `min_sum` and will not change the values of `n` or `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2**
