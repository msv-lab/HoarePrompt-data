To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `while b:`. The loop will continue as long as `b` is truthy (non-zero). 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `a` is `b_val`
- `b` is `b_prev % b_val`

The key point is that `b` must be non-zero for the loop to execute again. Since `b` is defined as `b_prev % b_val`, we need to ensure that `b_prev` is such that the modulus operation does not result in zero.

To ensure that `b` is non-zero for the next iteration, we can adjust `b_prev` so that it is not a multiple of `b_val`. Therefore, we can state that `b_prev` must be adjusted to a value that is not congruent to 0 modulo `b_val`.

Thus, the adjusted states should be:
- `b_prev` must be adjusted to ensure `b_prev % b_val` is non-zero.

State: **`a` is `b_val`, `b` is `b_prev % b_val`, and `b_prev` is adjusted to ensure `b_prev % b_val` is non-zero**
