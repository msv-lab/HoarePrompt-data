According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has been assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is not a multiple of `b`, this means that `a % b` is not zero, so `b` must be greater than zero. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `b` remains non-zero after the last assignment. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and `b` is greater than 0**
