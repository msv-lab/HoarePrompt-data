The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. If `b` is greater than 0, the function returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `a` and `b`; otherwise, it returns `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return their GCD if `b` is greater than 0, or return `a` if `b` is not greater than 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, returns the GCD of a and b if b is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns a.**
