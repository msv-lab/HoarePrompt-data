According to the code, the loop will execute while `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, which means it has been decremented by 1 in the last iteration. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be `k - 2`, which means `k` should be at least 2 for the loop to run again.

The state of `k` does not change in the loop, and since `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` are not directly affected by the loop index `i`, they remain unchanged.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `k - 2` to allow the loop to execute one more time.

Now, since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` should be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence` is updated to `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `k - 2`**
