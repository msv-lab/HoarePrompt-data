According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the loop variable `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `k - 1` (which is greater than or equal to 2 since `k` is at least 3), meaning it has already executed down to `0`. 

To execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `-1`, which is the terminating condition of the loop. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `-1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 for `i` in the range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is -1**
