The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` consecutive integers starting from 1. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, the function returns -1. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function constructs a sequence of `k` integers where the sum is as close as possible to `n`, and returns this sequence. The construction of the sequence involves distributing the remainder after dividing `n` by the minimum sum, ensuring that the integers in the sequence are adjusted accordingly.
