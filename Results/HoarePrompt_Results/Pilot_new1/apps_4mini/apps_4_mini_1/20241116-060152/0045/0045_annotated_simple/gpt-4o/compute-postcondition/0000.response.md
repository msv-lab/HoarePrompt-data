The expression `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2` calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers, but the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided. Therefore, we can only express the output state in terms of `k`.

The calculation for `min_sum` will yield a specific value based on the value of `k`, but since `n` is not directly affected by this line of code, it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2**
