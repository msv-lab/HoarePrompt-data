To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the program's logic.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence must be maximized.
3. If no such sequence exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program focuses on calculating the GCD of two numbers, `n` and `k`, using the Euclidean algorithm. The function `func_1` returns the GCD of `n` and `k`, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described. 

### Missing Logic:
1. The program does not construct the sequence of `k` integers that sum to `n`. It only computes the GCD.
2. There is no logic to check if a strictly increasing sequence can be formed with the given constraints.
3. The program does not handle cases where it's impossible to form such a sequence (e.g., when `k` is greater than `n`).

### Example Cases:
- For the input `5 3`, the expected output is `-1` because it's impossible to create a strictly increasing sequence of 3 positive integers that sum to 5.
- For the input `6 3`, the expected output is `1 2 3`, which is a valid sequence that sums to 6.
- For the input `8 2`, the expected output could be `2 6`, which is also valid.

### Conclusion:
Since the program only computes the GCD and does not address the creation of the sequence or handle edge cases, it does not fulfill the problem requirements completely. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
