The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is `k - 1`, and the current value of `sequence[i]` is unchanged. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
