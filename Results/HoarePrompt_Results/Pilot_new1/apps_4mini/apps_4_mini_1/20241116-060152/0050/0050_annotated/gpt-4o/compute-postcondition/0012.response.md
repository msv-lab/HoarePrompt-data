Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, then prints `total_bourles`. This accounts for edge cases where `r` is less than `min_buy_price`, resulting in zero shares, and ensures that all values are handled appropriately based on the relationship between `max_sell_price` and `min_buy_price`.***
