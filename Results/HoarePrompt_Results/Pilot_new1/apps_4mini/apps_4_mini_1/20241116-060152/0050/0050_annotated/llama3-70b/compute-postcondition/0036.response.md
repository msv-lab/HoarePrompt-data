Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as `s[0]`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is less than `m`. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
