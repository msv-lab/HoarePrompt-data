Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[2]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[2]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[2]`. If `r` is less than `s[2]`, the loop or if statement is exited without any changes to `shares` or `r`.***
