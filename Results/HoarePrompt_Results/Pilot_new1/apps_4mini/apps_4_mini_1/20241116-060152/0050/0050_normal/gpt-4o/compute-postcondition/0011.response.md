The code prints the value of `total_bourles`, which is already calculated based on the values of `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles`. The output state does not change any variables, so we only need to reflect the current state of `total_bourles`.

Output State: **`total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles` and is printed**.
