The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of three integers, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown, but they will now hold the values provided by the user input. The lists `s` and `b` remain unaffected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n`, `m`, and `r` based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input, and `s` and `b` remain unchanged.**
