The variable `s` is assigned a list of integers created from user input, which is split into separate values and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `s` as a list of integers, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` remains unchanged**
