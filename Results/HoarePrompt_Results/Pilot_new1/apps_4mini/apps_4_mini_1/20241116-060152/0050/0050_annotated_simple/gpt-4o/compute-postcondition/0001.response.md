The variable `s` is assigned a new value, which is a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected, but `s` will now contain a list of integers based on the input provided. The exact values of `s` depend on the input given. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `b` is a list of m integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input, `b` is a list of m integers**
