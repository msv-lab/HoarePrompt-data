The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n` and `m`, both of which are integers constrained to the range 1 to 30; `r`, which is an integer constrained to the range 1 to 1000; `s`, which is a list of integers representing share prices, where each price `s_i` satisfies the condition 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000; and `b`, which is a list of integers representing selling prices, where each price `b_i` also satisfies the condition 1 <= `b_i` <= 1000. 

The function does not return a specified output in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters, but the output or return value is not defined in the provided context.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer), m (an integer), r (an integer), s (a list of integers representing share prices), and b (a list of integers representing selling prices). The return value is not specified.**
