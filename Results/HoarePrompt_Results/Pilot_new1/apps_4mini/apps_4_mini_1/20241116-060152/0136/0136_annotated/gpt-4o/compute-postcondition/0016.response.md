The code executes a print statement that outputs the character '<'. The values of the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b`, along with the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros, `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, and the output is '<'**.
