The variable `b` is assigned the value `'0'`, which means `b` now holds the string `'0'`. The initial states of `a` and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; if `a` is initially empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is '0', and `data` is unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; if `a` is initially empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is '0', and `data` is unchanged.**
