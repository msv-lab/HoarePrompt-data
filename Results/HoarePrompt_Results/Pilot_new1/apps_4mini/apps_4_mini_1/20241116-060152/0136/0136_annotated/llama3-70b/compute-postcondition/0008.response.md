The code prints the string `'>'`. The values of the variables `a` and `b` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed; `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed. The strings `a` and `b` are not equal, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
