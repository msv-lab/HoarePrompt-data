Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description and output hints.

### Problem Description:
The program is supposed to compare two very long integers (which may have leading zeroes) and print:
- "<" if the first integer is less than the second,
- ">" if the first integer is greater than the second,
- "=" if both integers are equal.

### Program Code:
```python
a = input().lstrip('0')
b = input().lstrip('0')
if a == b:
    print('=')
elif a < b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('>')
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program reads two integers as strings and removes leading zeroes using `lstrip('0')`.
2. It then compares the two stripped strings:
   - If they are equal, it prints "=".
   - If the first number is less than the second, it prints "<".
   - If the first number is greater than the second, it prints ">".

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Both inputs are "0" (should print "=").
- One input is "0" and the other is a non-zero number (should print "<" or ">").
- Leading zeroes (e.g., "000123" vs "123") should be handled correctly.
- Very large numbers (up to 10^6 digits) should be compared correctly after leading zeroes are stripped.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function accepts two non-negative integers as input, removes leading zeroes, and compares them correctly, printing the appropriate symbol. 

### Verification Against Output Hints:
- The output hints state that the function compares the stripped strings correctly and prints the correct symbols based on the comparison. 
- The hints also confirm that the function does not return any values and relies on standard input/output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It handles leading zeroes, and the comparison logic is sound. The output hints align with the functionality of the code, and I cannot find any edge cases or scenarios where the code would fail to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly strips leading zeroes and compares the two large integers as strings, ensuring accurate comparison for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.
