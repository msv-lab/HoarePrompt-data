Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed, and `b` is the string representation of the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed. If `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; if `b` is empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and now `a` is strictly greater than `b`.***
