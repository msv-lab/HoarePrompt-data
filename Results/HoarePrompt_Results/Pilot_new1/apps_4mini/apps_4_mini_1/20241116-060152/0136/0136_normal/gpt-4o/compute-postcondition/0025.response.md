Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are the string representations of numbers with leading zeros removed, with `a` set to '0' if empty and `b` set to '0' if empty. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output is '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, or '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. This ensures that comparisons handle all edge cases, including empty strings treated as '0'.***
