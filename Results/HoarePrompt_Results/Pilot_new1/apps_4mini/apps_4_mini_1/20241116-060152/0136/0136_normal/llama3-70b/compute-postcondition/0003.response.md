The code simply prints the string `'='`, and does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to `a` or `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, and `a` is equal to `b`.**
