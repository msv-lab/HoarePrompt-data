The code prints the string `'='`, which does not change the values of `a` or `b`. The output state remains unchanged except for the action of printing. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, and `a` is equal to `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, and `a` is equal to `b`.**
