The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state indicates that `b` is a non-negative integer string, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input. The value of `data[1]` is not specified, but it will be processed to remove any leading zeros. 

The output state is affected by the assignment of `b`, but the state of `a` and `data` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b` without leading zeros.

Output State: **`a` is the first string in `data` with leading zeros removed, `b` is the string from `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
