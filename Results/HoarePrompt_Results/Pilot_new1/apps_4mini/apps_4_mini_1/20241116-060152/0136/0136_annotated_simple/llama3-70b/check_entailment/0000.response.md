Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where both inputs are "0" correctly. According to the problem description, if both `a` and `b` are "0", the output should be "=", but the program will strip the leading zeros and compare the empty strings. The comparison will yield that the empty string is less than any other string, leading to an incorrect output.

For example, consider the input:
```
0
0
```
The program will process this as:
```
a = input().lstrip('0')  # a becomes ""
b = input().lstrip('0')  # b becomes ""
```
Then it checks if `a == b`, which is `True`, so it prints "=". This is correct for this specific case, but it fails to account for the fact that leading zeros should be preserved in the comparison logic.

However, if we test with inputs like:
```
0000
0000
```
The output will also be "=", which is correct. 

The main issue arises when the inputs are different but equal when leading zeros are considered, e.g.:
```
00012345
12345
```
The program correctly outputs "=", but it fails to handle the case when both inputs are "0" correctly if they are stripped down to empty strings.

Thus, while the program works for many cases, the handling of leading zeros is inconsistent for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the final conclusion is that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case outlined in the problem description.
