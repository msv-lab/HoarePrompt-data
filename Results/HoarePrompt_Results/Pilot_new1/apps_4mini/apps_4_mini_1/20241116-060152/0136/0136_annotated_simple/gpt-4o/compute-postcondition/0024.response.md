Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings derived from the first two elements of `data` with leading zeros removed; if either was originally empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal and `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='.***
