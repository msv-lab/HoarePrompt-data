The value of `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Since `remainder` is `n % 10` and is greater than 5, we can deduce that `10 - remainder` will yield a positive value. Therefore, `result` will be calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`, which effectively rounds `n` up to the nearest multiple of 10. The value of `n` is not specified but is an input integer. 

Thus, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `remainder` is `n % 10`, `remainder` is greater than 5, and `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is `n % 10`, `remainder` is greater than 5, and `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`**
