The code prints the value of `n + (10 - n % 10)`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, not a multiple of 10, and `n % 10` is greater than 5, it follows that `n % 10` can be 6, 7, 8, or 9. 

Calculating `10 - n % 10` will yield values as follows:
- If `n % 10` is 6, then `10 - n % 10` is 4.
- If `n % 10` is 7, then `10 - n % 10` is 3.
- If `n % 10` is 8, then `10 - n % 10` is 2.
- If `n % 10` is 9, then `10 - n % 10` is 1.

Therefore, the expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` will yield:
- If `n % 10` is 6, then the result is `n + 4`.
- If `n % 10` is 7, then the result is `n + 3`.
- If `n % 10` is 8, then the result is `n + 2`.
- If `n % 10` is 9, then the result is `n + 1`.

The output will consist of the value of `n` and the calculated result. Since `n` can vary within the specified constraints, we express the output state accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, `n % 10` is greater than 5; the printed value is `n + (10 - n % 10)`**.
