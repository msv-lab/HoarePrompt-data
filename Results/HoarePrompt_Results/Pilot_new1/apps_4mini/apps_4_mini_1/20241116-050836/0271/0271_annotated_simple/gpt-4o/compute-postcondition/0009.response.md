Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` from user input, rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10, and prints the result. If the last digit of `n` (the remainder) is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from `n`; if it is greater than 5, it adds the difference to reach the next multiple of 10. The function does not return a value but directly prints the rounded result. **
