The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to \(10^9\). The function will return a value based on the value of `n`, but since the specific output behavior is not provided, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to handle a non-negative integer `n` within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on a non-negative integer n within the range of 0 to 10^9, returning a value based on that integer.**
