The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^9, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` based on the input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer based on the input**
