Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; if `remainder` (which is `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n - remainder`, effectively rounding `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`, effectively rounding `n` up to the nearest multiple of 10. Thus, `result` will always be the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`.***
