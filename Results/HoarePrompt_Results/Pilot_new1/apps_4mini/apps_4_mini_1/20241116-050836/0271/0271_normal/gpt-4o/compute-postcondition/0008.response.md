The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). Since there are no specific output cases provided in the prompt, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior of the function based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined without additional details regarding its output.
