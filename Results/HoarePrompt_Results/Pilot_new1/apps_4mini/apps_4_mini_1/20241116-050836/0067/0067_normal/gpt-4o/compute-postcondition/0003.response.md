The code assigns the value of `y` to `min_downvotes`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are integers based on the input. The value of `min_downvotes` is now equal to the value of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer based on the input, `y` is an integer based on the input, `z` is an integer based on the input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer based on the input, `y` is an integer based on the input, `z` is an integer based on the input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`**
