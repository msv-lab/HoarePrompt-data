The code `print('?')` outputs the string `?` to the console but does not change the values of any variables. The initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and the value of `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and the value of `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.**
