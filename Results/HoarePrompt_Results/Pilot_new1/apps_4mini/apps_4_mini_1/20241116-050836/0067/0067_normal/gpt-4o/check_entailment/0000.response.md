Let's analyze the provided code against the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires determining the voting outcome based on the number of upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and uncertain votes (`z`). The possible outcomes are:
- "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes.
- "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.
- "0" if upvotes are equal to downvotes.
- "?" if there are multiple possible outcomes due to uncertain votes.

### Provided Code:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
min_upvotes = x
max_upvotes = x + z
min_downvotes = y
max_downvotes = y + z
if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
    print('-')
elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
    print('+')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Code Analysis:
1. **Definitions**:
   - `min_upvotes` is simply `x`.
   - `max_upvotes` is `x + z`.
   - `min_downvotes` is `y`.
   - `max_downvotes` is `y + z`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks if the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum downvotes (`min_downvotes`). If true, it prints `'-'`.
   - The second condition checks if the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum upvotes (`min_upvotes`). If true, it prints `'+'`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is satisfied, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty.

### Edge Cases:
Let's evaluate some edge cases based on the problem description:
- **Case 1**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
  - `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`
  - The output should be `?` since both outcomes "+" (if the unknown votes up) and "-" (if the unknown votes down) are possible.

- **Case 2**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
  - `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`
  - The output should be `+` since upvotes are always greater than downvotes.

- **Case 3**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
  - `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`
  - The output should be `0` since upvotes equal downvotes.

- **Case 4**: `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
  - `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`
  - The output should be `-` since downvotes are greater than upvotes.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints correctly summarize the function's behavior:
- They state that the function checks the relationships between maximum and minimum upvotes and downvotes, which aligns with the code.
- They correctly identify that the function will print `-`, `+`, or `?` based on the evaluated conditions.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases appropriately and produces the expected outputs for all scenarios considered.

Correctness: **True**.
