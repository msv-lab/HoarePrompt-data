The `print('+')` statement outputs the character '+' to the console. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as this statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` are still within their defined range, and the output of the print statement is noted.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100]. The value of `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`. The output is '+'**
