The `print('-')` statement outputs a string consisting of a single hyphen. This action does not modify any of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `max_upvotes`, or `min_downvotes`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates that a hyphen has been printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers, `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, where `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z` and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and a hyphen has been printed.**
