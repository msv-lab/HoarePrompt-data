The code executes a print statement that outputs the string `+`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the string `+` has been printed, while the values of the other variables are still intact.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers, and the output is '+'**
