The function accepts three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, through user input. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is positive, or if `x` is greater than `y` while being less than or equal to `y + z`. The function does not return any value.
