Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, then '+' is printed. If `x` is less than `y`, then '-' is printed. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '0' is printed. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is not 0, or if `x` is greater than `y` while still being less than or equal to `y + z`, then '?' is printed. This covers all possible relationships between `x`, `y`, and `z`.***
