The code executes a print statement that outputs a string `?`. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as there are no assignments or modifications made to them. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers, and the output is '?'**
