To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and its annotations, as well as the examples provided in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The output should be:
   - "+" if upvotes are definitively more than downvotes.
   - "-" if downvotes are definitively more than upvotes.
   - "0" if upvotes and downvotes are equal.
   - "?" if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

### Analysis of the Code:
The code calculates the minimum and maximum possible values for both upvotes and downvotes:
- `min_upvotes = x` (there are at least `x` upvotes)
- `max_upvotes = x + z` (the maximum possible upvotes if all unknown votes are upvotes)
- `min_downvotes = y` (there are at least `y` downvotes)
- `max_downvotes = y + z` (the maximum possible downvotes if all unknown votes are downvotes)

The decision structure is as follows:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints "-".
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints "+".
3. Otherwise, it prints "?".

### Evaluating the Cases:
- **Case 1:** `x = 3, y = 7, z = 0`
  - `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`
  - Result: `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` → Output: "-" (correct)
  
- **Case 2:** `x = 2, y = 0, z = 1`
  - `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`
  - Result: `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` → Output: "+" (correct)

- **Case 3:** `x = 1, y = 1, z = 0`
  - `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`
  - Result: `min_upvotes == min_downvotes` → Output: "0" (correct)

- **Case 4:** `x = 0, y = 0, z = 1`
  - `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`
  - Result: `max_upvotes > min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes > min_upvotes` → Output: "?" (correct)

### Edge Cases:
Now, let's consider if there are any edge cases that might not be handled correctly:
- If `z = 0`, the program handles it correctly by directly comparing `x` and `y`.
- If `z > 0`, the uncertainty is correctly captured by the conditions checking for the ranges of upvotes and downvotes.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all potential cases. The annotations confirm that the logic in the code matches the expected outcomes based on the given inputs. There are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
