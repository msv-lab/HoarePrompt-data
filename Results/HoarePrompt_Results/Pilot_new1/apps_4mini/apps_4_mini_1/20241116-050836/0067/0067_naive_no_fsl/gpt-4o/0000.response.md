Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the result could be "0". Specifically, if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, the program correctly identifies that the result should be "0". However, if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, the program will output "?", which is incorrect according to the problem description.

For example, consider the input:

```
1 1 1
```

In this case:
- Upvotes = 1
- Downvotes = 1
- Unknown votes = 1

The possible outcomes could be:
- If the unknown votes all upvote, the result is "+".
- If the unknown votes all downvote, the result is "-".

Thus, the result is uncertain and should be "?", which the program correctly identifies. However, if we consider:

```
1 1 0
```

The output should be "0" because there are equal upvotes and downvotes with no unknown votes. 

But if we have:

```
1 1 1
```

The program outputs "?", which is correct. 

However, it fails to account for the case where `x = y` and `z = 0` leading to the same output "0". 

Thus, the program does not account for all potential cases correctly, leading to a conclusion of correctness being false.
