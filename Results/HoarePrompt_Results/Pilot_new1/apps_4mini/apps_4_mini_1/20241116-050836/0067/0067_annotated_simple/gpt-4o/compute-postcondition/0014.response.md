The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. However, since the function does not take any input arguments, it cannot evaluate or return any values based on these parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not defined in terms of input parameters or return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values based on the constraints provided.**
