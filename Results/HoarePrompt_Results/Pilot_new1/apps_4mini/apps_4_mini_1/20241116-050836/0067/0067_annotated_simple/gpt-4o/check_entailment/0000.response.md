To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Code Analysis

The program reads three integers: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes, respectively. It then calculates:

- `min_upvotes = x`: the minimum number of upvotes (which is just `x` since we don't know how the uncertain votes might affect this).
- `max_upvotes = x + z`: the maximum number of upvotes (if all uncertain votes are upvotes).
- `min_downvotes = y`: the minimum number of downvotes (which is just `y`).
- `max_downvotes = y + z`: the maximum number of downvotes (if all uncertain votes are downvotes).

The program then checks:

1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'`, indicating that downvotes will definitely outnumber upvotes.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'`, indicating that upvotes will definitely outnumber downvotes.
3. If neither condition is met, it prints `'?'`, indicating that the result is uncertain.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider the edge cases and scenarios outlined in the problem description:

1. **Case when x = 0, y = 0, z = 1**:
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - Both upvotes and downvotes can be equal (0 or 1), so the output should be `'?'` (uncertain).
   - The program correctly outputs `'?'`.

2. **Case when x = 3, y = 7, z = 0**:
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`.
   - Since `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, the output should be `'-'`.
   - The program correctly outputs `'-'`.

3. **Case when x = 2, y = 0, z = 1**:
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - Since `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, the output should be `'+'`.
   - The program correctly outputs `'+'`.

4. **Case when x = 1, y = 1, z = 0**:
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - Since `min_upvotes` equals `min_downvotes`, the output should be `'0'`.
   - The program does not handle this case correctly, as it does not have a condition for this scenario.

### Conclusion

The program fails to account for the case where the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes when there are no uncertain votes (i.e., `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0). The expected output in such a scenario should be `'0'`, but the program does not explicitly check for this condition, leading to incorrect results.

Given this analysis, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
