The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The values of `x` and `z` are both integers between 0 and 100, so `max_upvotes` will also be an integer between 0 and 200. The previous values of `y` and `min_upvotes` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, and `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`**.
