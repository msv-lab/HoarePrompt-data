The variable `counts` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. This means `counts` will hold a list of integers that are inputted as space-separated values. The previous values of `counts` remain unchanged until this line executes. Therefore, the output state reflects that `counts` now contains a list of integers based on user input, while `n`, `m`, and `colors` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers from input, and `counts` is a list of integers from input.**
