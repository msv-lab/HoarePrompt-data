The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not previously in `color_counts`, it is now added with a value of 0 and then incremented to 1. If `color` was already in `color_counts`, its previous value is increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `colors`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `color_counts`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `color` is the third element in the `colors` list, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
