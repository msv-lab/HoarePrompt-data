Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is unchanged, `j` is one greater than its previous value, `i` is unchanged, and `n` is unchanged. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
