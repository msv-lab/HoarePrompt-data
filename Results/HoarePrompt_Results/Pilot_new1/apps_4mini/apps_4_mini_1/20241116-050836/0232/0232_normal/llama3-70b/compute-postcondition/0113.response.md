Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary. If the counts of the sorted values in `window_counts` match the `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, `found` remains unchanged, `j` is one greater than its previous value, `i` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.***
