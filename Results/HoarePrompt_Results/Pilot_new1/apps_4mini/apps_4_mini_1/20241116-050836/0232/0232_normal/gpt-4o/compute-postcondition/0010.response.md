Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers ranging from 1 to `m`, `k` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_i ≤ n, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`. If all values in `current_counts` for each color in `desired_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, the function does not return anything. Additionally, it is guaranteed that at least one value in `current_counts` exceeds its counterpart in `desired_counts` for some color.***
