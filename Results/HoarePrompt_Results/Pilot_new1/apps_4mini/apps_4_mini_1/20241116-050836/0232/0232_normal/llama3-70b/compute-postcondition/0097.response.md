Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is set to True if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding elements in `counts` for all elements, while `j` remains `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and the state of `window_counts` and other variables remains unchanged.***
