Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. If the condition is not satisfied, the program continues execution without changes to `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, or `color`, and `window_counts[color]` remains incremented by 1.***
