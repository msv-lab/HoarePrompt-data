Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`; otherwise, `found` remains False. The variable `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0, while `window_counts[color]` has been increased by 1 prior to the evaluation of the condition. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
