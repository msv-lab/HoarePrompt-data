Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `color` is the third element in the `colors` list. If `color` was not previously in `color_counts`, it is now added with a value of 0. If `color` was already in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
