Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_i ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, `current_counts` has been updated such that for each `color` in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is equal to `desired_counts[color]`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0.***
