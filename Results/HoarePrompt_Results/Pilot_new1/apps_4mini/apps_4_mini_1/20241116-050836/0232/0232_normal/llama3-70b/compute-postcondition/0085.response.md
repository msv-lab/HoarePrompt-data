Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, if `found` is True, the loop is exited, `j` is set to `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `i`. If `found` is False, the loop continues to execute until the conditions are met or it exits naturally, leaving `window_counts` potentially empty or with fewer unique colors than `counts`, while `j`, `i`, and `n` retain their respective states as described.***
