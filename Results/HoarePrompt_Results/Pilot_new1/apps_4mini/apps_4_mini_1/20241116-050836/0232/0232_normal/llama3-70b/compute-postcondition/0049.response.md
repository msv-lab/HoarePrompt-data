Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`; otherwise, `found` remains False. The variable `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is at least 0 and less than `n`. The `window_counts[color]` has been increased by 1 for each unique color encountered. If `n` is 0 or `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, `i` is unchanged, and `j` is not defined.**
