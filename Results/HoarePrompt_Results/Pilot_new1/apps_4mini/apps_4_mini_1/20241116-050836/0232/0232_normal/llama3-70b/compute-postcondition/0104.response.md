The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `i + 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
