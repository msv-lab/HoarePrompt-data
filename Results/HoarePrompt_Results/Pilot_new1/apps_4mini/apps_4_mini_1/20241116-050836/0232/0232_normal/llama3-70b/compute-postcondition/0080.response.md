Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is set to True, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, we break out of the most internal loop. This handles the edge case where `window_counts` is empty or has fewer elements than `counts`, ensuring that `found` remains False in such scenarios.***
