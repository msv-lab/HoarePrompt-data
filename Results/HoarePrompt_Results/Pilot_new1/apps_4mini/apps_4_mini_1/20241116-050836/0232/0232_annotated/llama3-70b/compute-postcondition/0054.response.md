The variable `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the previous values of `color_counts`, `i`, `j`, or `found`, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `window_counts`.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts; `window_counts` is an empty dictionary; `i` is less than `n`; `j` remains unchanged; `found` is False**
