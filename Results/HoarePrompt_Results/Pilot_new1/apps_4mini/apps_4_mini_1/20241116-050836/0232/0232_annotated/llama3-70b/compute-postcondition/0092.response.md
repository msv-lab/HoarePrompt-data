Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `window_counts` is a dictionary that includes the key `color` with a value of 0 if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `n` remains unchanged. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, it retains its previous value.***
