The code assigns values to `n` and `m` by taking input and mapping it to integers. The values of `n` and `m` are determined by the input provided, but they must adhere to the constraints: `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ m ≤ n`. The lists `colors` and `counts` remain unchanged, and their previous values are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of n integers, and `counts` is a list of m integers.**
