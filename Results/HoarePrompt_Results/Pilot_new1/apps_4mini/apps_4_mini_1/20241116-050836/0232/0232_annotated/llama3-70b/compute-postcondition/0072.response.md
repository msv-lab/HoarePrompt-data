Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[n]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts of the colors in `window_counts` match the target counts (as indicated by `all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts))`), then `found` is set to True, and the loop is exited. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, and the loop continues.***
