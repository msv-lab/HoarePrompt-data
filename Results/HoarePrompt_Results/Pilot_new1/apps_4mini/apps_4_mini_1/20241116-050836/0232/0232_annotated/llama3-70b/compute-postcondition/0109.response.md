Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `window_counts` remains unchanged unless `color` was not previously a key in `window_counts`, in which case `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, with `j` being equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
