Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts; `i` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than `i + 2; `j` is equal to `i + 2; `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0; if `color` is already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
