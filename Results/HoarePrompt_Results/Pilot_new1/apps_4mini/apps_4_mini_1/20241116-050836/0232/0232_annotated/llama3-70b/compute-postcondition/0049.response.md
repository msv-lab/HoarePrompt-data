Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts; `window_counts` is a dictionary that counts occurrences of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` to `n-1`. If the counts in `window_counts` match the `counts` based on the sorted values, then `found` is set to True; otherwise, it remains False. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, and `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute, and the state of all variables is preserved as initially defined.**
