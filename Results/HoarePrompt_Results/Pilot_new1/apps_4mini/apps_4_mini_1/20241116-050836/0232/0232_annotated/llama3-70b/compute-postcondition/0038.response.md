The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts; `i` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `j` is `i + 1`; `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`; `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1; `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop.
