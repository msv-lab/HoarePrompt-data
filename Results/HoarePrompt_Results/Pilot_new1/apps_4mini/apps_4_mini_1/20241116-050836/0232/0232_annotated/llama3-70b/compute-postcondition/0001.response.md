The `colors` variable is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate strings. The input will be a space-separated string of integers, which will be converted into a list of integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not changed by this operation, and the `counts` list remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment to `colors` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of n integers from input, and `counts` is a list of m integers.**
