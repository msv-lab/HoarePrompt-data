The function accepts input values for `n` (the number of colors) and `m` (the maximum color value), along with a list of `colors` and a list of `counts`. It counts the occurrences of each color and checks if there exists a contiguous subarray of `colors` where the frequency of each unique color matches the corresponding values in `counts`. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input might be invalid (e.g., `n` or `m` being less than 1).
