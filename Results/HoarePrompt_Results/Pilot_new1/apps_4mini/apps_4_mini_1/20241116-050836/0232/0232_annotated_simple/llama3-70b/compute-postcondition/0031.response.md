Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary of color counts, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer, `counts` is a list of integers, and `window_counts` contains `color` as a key with a value of 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts` exactly, then `found` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the values do not match, `found` remains False and `window_counts` remains unchanged.***
