The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to `n`, where `j` is the current index in that range; the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts`, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
