Output State: **`window_counts` contains the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to `n`, where `j` is the current index in that range. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop exits. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` remains False, and all other variables retain their initial values.**
