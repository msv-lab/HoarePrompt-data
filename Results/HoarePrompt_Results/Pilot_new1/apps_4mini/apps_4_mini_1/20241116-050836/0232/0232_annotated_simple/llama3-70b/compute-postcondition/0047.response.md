Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary of color counts, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer, and `counts` is a list of integers. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and no further actions are taken regarding the loop or if statement.***
