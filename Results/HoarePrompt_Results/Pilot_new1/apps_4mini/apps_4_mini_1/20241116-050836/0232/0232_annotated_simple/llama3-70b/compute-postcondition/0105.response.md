Postcondition: ***`found` is False initially, and if the counts of `window_counts` match the `counts` after sorting, then `found` is set to True and the most internal loop is exited. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, and the loop continues with `i` still less than `n` and `j` equal to `i + 1`.***
