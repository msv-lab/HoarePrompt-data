The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` is a dictionary of color counts, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer, `counts` is a list of integers, `found` is True, `window_counts` has `color` as a key with a value of 1, and the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts` exactly, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
