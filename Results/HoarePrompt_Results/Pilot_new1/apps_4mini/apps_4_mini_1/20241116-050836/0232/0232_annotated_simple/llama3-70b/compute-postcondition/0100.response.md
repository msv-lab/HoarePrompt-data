The line of code `window_counts[color] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. The previous state indicates that `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j]`, and `j` is `i + 1`, while `i` is less than `n`. The variable `found` remains `False`, and the states of `i`, `j`, and `n` do not change. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is set to 0**
