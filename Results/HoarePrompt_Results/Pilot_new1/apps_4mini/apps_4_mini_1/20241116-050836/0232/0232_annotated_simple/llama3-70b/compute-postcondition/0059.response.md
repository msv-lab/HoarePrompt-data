Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is an empty dictionary initially. If `color` is not a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. The variables `found` remains False, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` already exists in `window_counts`, its state remains unchanged.***
