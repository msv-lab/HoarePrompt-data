The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` is a dictionary of color counts, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer, `counts` is a list of integers, `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
