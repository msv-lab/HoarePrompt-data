Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary of color counts, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer, `counts` is a list of integers, and `window_counts` contains `color` as a key. If `color` was not already in `window_counts`, its value is initialized to 0. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
