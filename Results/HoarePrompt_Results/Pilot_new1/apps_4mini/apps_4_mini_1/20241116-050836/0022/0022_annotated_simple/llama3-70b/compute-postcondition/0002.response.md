The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state of `s` (a string consisting of English letters) and `n` (the length of `s`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is True.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is True**
