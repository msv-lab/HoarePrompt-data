Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in `s` are not equal, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the loop or statement is exited. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True, preserving the condition that `s` may still be a palindrome.***
