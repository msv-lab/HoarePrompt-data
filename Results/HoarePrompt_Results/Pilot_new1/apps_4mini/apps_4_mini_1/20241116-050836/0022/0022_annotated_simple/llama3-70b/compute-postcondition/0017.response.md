Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, it is False. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `n` is 2, the loop executes once, comparing the two characters. If they are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False. If they are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `n` is odd, the loop executes `n // 2` times, checking the characters symmetrically. If any pair of characters do not match, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop exits.**
