The length of the string `s` is calculated using `len(s)`, which assigns the length of `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` will be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s`**
