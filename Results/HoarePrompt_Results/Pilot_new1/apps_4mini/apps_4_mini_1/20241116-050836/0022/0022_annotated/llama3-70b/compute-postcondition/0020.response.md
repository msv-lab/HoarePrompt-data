Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user, checks if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome or 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or contains non-English letters, but it assumes the input will be a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000.**
