Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is False if the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` are not equal, causing a break from the loop. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that `s` is potentially a palindrome.***
