The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state of other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n // 2`, and `is_spalindrome` is `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is `n // 2`, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
