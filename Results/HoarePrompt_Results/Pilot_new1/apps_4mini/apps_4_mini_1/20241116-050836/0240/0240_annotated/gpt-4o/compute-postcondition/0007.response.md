The code snippet `yield candidate` is used to generate a value from a generator function. In this case, `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm`, which is the next permutation of `chars`. The `yield` statement does not change the state of the variables, but it produces a value to be returned when the generator is iterated over. 

Since `candidate` is equal to `perm`, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and indicates that a value has been yielded.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
