The variable `c` is the third character of the string `s`, which is a digit. The operation `n += c` attempts to add the string `c` to `n`. However, since `n` is likely an integer and `c` is a string, this operation would typically raise an error in Python as you cannot directly add a string to an integer without conversion.

Given that the initial state specifies that `n` remains unchanged, we will assume that the operation does not successfully modify `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` remains unchanged and indicates the attempted operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing digits with a length of at least 3, `c` is the third character of `s`, `n` remains unchanged, and the operation `n += c` is attempted but does not succeed.**
