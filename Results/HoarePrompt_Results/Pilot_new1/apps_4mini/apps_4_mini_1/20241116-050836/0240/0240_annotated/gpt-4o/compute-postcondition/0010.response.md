The code assigns the value of `''.join(perm)` to `candidate`. The `join` method concatenates the elements of `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold that next permutation as a string. The previous values of `chars` and `perm` remain unchanged, and there are still more permutations to process. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is now the string representation of `perm`, and there are more permutations of `chars` remaining to process.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string representation of `perm`, and there are more permutations of `chars` remaining to process.**
