The variable `t_set` is assigned the value of `set(t)`, which creates a set of unique characters from the string `t`. The initial state indicates that `t` is a non-empty string, so `t_set` will contain the unique characters from `t`. The string `s` remains unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the output state is that `s` is a string containing digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `t_set` contains the unique characters from `t`.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t_set` contains the unique characters from `t`**
