The function accepts a string `s` containing digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after subtracting the occurrences of characters in `sub`. It then generates a list of possible numbers from these remaining characters and returns the smallest number from that list. If `sub` contains characters not found in `s`, or if `s` is empty, the function may not behave as expected, and the handling of such cases is not explicitly covered in the code.
