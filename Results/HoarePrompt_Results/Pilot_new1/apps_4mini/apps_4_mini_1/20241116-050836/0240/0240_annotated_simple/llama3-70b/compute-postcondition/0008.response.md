Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing at least 2 digits, `t_set` contains the unique characters from `t`, and `n` is a string that may include the first character `c` of `s`. If `c` is an element of `t_set`, then `n` is updated to include `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged.***
