To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Code Analysis
The function `func_1(s, t)` is intended to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` that Vasya could have passed to Kate given a string `s` (the shuffled digits) and a substring `t` (the remembered part of `n`).

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t_set` is created from `t`, which contains the unique characters in `t`.
   - `n` is initialized as an empty string.

2. **Character Filtering**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in `s`.
   - If `c` is found in `t_set`, it is appended to `n`.
   - After this loop, `n` contains all characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`.

3. **Final Assembly**:
   - The substring `t` is appended to `n`.
   - The function then returns the integer value of `n`.

### Problem Description Requirements
The requirements state that:
- `n` should be the smallest possible integer that can be formed.
- It should not have leading zeros unless `n` is zero itself.

### Potential Issues
1. **Leading Zeros**: 
   - The program does not handle leading zeros correctly. For example, if `s` contains digits that can lead to a valid number but result in leading zeros when combined with `t`, the output may not be valid. For instance:
     - If `s = "003512"` and `t = "021"`, the function will generate `n = "30021"` which is valid.
     - However, if `s = "000012"` and `t = "021"`, the function will generate `n = "30021"` again, which is valid, but it does not ensure that it is the smallest number that can be formed because it does not consider the order of digits or the leading zero issue correctly.

2. **Character Order**:
   - The order of characters in `n` is determined solely by their presence in `s` and `t`. The program does not guarantee that the smallest possible integer is formed, as it may not account for the optimal arrangement of digits to minimize the integer.

### Example of Failure
Consider the following input:
- `s = "000012"` 
- `t = "021"`

The program will yield `30021`, which is valid, but it can also yield `120` if the digits are rearranged correctly, which is smaller. Hence, the program does not guarantee the smallest possible integer.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not ensure the formation of the smallest integer `n` and can lead to outputs with leading zeros or not in the optimal order, it fails to meet the problem description requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
