The code uses a `yield` statement, which produces a generator that yields the value of `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is equal to `perm`, which is the second permutation of `chars`. The values of `chars` and `perm` remain unchanged, and the `yield` statement does not alter any of the variables but returns `candidate` when called. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`**
