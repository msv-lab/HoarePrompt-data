Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing digits with at least 3 characters, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, and `n` is updated based on the second character of `s`. If the third character `c` of `s` is in `t_set`, then `n` is incremented by `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged.***
