Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`. It constructs a new string `n` by including characters from `s` that are also present in `t`, and then appends the entire string `t` to `n`. Finally, it returns the integer value of the constructed string `n`. If `s` contains no characters from `t`, or if `s` is empty, `n` will still include the characters from `t`, and consequently, the function will return the integer value of `t`. If `t` contains non-digit characters, this will result in a `ValueError` when attempting to convert `n` to an integer.**
