The code executes a `yield` statement, which produces a value and pauses the function's state for later resumption. The variable `candidate` is yielded, but the values of `chars` and `perm` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and indicates that `candidate` has been yielded.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the second permutation of `chars`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
