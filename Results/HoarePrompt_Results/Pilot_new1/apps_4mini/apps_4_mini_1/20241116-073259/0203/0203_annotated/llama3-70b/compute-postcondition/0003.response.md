The variable `remocrats` is assigned the value `0`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged, with `n` being an input integer, `fractions` being a string of length `n`, and `depublicans` being `0`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
