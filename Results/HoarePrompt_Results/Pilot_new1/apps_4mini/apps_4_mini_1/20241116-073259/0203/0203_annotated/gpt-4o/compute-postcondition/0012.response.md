The code `r_queue.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The variable `i` is equal to the length of `votes`, which is a non-empty string. Therefore, `i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The state of `n`, `votes`, and `v` is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is equal to the length of `votes`; `v` is the character at index `i` in `votes` (if it exists); `r_queue` now contains the value `i`.**
