The value of `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it still holds the value of the input integer. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
