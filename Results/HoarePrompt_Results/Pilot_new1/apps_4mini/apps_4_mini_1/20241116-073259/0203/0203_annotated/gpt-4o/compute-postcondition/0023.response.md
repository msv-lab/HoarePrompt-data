The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The state of `d_queue` changes depending on its initial condition. Since `d_queue` is either empty or contains indices of 'D' characters, the new value added will depend on the values of `d_index` and `n`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is either empty or contains indices of 'D' characters, and `d_queue` now includes the value `d_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is either empty or contains indices of 'D' characters, and `d_queue` now includes the value `d_index + n`**
