Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes the indices of these characters in a queue-like manner. If all 'D' characters are processed first, it prints 'D'; if all 'R' characters are processed first, it prints 'R'. If the input string `votes` is empty, the function will not execute the loop and will default to printing 'R' since `r_queue` will remain empty. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. **
