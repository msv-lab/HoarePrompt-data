The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous values of `d_index` and `n` are not specified, but `d_queue` will have one more element added to it. The state of `r_queue` and its related variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `d_queue` with the new element.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element with the value `d_index + n`, `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_queue` is not empty, and `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`.**
