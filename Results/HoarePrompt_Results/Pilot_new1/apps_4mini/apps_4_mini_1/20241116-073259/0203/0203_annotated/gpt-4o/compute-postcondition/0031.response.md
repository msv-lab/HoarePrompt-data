The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is known (the first element removed from `r_queue`), but `n` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated state of `r_queue`, which now contains one additional element that is the result of `r_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_queue` now has one additional element which is `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`.**
