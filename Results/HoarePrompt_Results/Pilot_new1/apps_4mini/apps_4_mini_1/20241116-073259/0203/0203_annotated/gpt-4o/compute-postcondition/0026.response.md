Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is either empty or contains indices of 'D' characters. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` now includes the value `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is modified to include `r_index + n`, where `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue` and `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`. In both cases, the integrity of `d_queue` is maintained, and the modification to `r_queue` occurs only if the condition is met.***
