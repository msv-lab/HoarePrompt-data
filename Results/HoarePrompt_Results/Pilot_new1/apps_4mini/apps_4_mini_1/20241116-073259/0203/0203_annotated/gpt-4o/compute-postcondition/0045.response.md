Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, 'D' is printed, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain unchanged. If `d_queue` is empty, it indicates that either all 'D' characters have been processed (and `r_queue` may still contain non-'D' characters) or that `votes` is an empty string, resulting in 'R' being printed. In this case, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are also unchanged.***
