The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `fraction`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `fraction` is the third character of `fractions`, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `fraction` is the third character of `fractions`, and `depublicans` is increased by 1**
