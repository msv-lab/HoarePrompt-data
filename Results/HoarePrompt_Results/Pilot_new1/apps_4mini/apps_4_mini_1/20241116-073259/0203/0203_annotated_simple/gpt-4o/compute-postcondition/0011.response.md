The code appends the value of `i` to `d_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The state of `d_queue` will change as it will now include the index `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` now contains the index 0 and `i`; `r_queue` is empty; `i` is equal to `n`; `v` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` now contains the index 0 and `i`; `r_queue` is empty; `i` is equal to `n`; `v` is undefined**
