According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string. At the end of the last iteration, since `fractions` is a non-empty string, it must have had at least one character processed. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to identify the current character being processed and the remaining characters in the string:

1. Since the loop processes each character in `fractions`, if `n` is the length of `fractions`, and if one character has been processed, then `n` must be reduced by 1 to reflect the remaining characters.
2. The loop will continue until all characters in `fractions` have been processed, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than 1.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that one character has been processed and to ensure that there are still characters left in `fractions` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 199,999), `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least 1 character remaining**
