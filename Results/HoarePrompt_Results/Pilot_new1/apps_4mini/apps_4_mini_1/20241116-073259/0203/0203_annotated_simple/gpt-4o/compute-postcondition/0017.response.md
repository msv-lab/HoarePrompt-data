Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `n + 1`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is the character at index `n` in `votes`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains `i`. Otherwise, if `v` is any character other than 'D', `r_queue` includes the value `i`. This ensures that regardless of the value of `v`, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be updated accordingly.***
