Output State: **If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, then after the loop executes, `d_queue` and `r_queue` will contain elements based on the comparisons of the indices popped from each queue. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` will have `d_index + n` appended, otherwise `r_queue` will have `r_index + n` appended. The loop continues until at least one of the queues is empty. If either `d_queue` or `r_queue` is empty at the start, the loop does not execute, and both queues remain unchanged. After the loop, if it executed, `d_index` will be the last popped element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` will be the last popped element from `r_queue`. If `votes` is empty, both queues stay empty and the loop won't execute.**
