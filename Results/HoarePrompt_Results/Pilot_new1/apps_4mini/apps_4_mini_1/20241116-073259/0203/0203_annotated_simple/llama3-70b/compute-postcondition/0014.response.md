According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` string. The loop will continue iterating as long as there are characters remaining in `fractions`. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` has at least one more character remaining. 

Since the loop processes one character of `fractions` per iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the `fractions` string must have at least one character less than it did at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is one less character in `fractions`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining.**
