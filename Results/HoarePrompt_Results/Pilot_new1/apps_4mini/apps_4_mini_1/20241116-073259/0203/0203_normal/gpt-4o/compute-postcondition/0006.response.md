The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The initial value of `i` is 0, and since `d_queue` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `d_queue` will contain the value `[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty user input string, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty user input string, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is 'D'**
