Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is 'R', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0. The program correctly counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' based on the value of `fraction`.***
