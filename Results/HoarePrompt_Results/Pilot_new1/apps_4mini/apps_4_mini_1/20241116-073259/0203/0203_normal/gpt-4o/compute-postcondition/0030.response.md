The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous value of `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, and `n` is an integer that is added to `d_index`. The state of `r_queue` and `r_index` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`, and `d_queue` now has an additional element which is `d_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`, and `d_queue` now has an additional element which is `d_index + n`.**
