The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, which is removed from the list. The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged, and `n` and `votes` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' votes with the first element removed, `r_queue` is updated (first element removed), `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a non-empty user input string; `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`.**
