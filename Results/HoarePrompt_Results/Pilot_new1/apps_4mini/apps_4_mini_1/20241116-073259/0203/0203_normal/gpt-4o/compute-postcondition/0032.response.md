Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` each have one less element than before. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` now has an additional element which is `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` has one additional element which is `r_index + n`. In both cases, `d_index` remains the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, and `r_index` remains the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`.***
