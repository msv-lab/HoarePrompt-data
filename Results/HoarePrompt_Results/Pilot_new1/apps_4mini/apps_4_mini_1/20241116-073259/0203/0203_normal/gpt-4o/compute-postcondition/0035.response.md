The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns that value to `r_index`. The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged, but `r_queue` loses its first element. The previous value of `d_index` is not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state is: `d_queue` has at least 1 element (now it has one less), `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the value of the removed element from `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least 1 element (now it has one less), `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the value of the removed element from `r_queue`.**
