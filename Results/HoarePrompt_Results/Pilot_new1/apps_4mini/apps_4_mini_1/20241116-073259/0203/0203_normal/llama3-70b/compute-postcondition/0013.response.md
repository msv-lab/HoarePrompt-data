Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; if the second character `fraction` exists and is equal to 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1; otherwise, `remocrats` is increased by 1. In the case where `n` is 1, `fraction` does not exist, leading to an increase in `remocrats`.***
