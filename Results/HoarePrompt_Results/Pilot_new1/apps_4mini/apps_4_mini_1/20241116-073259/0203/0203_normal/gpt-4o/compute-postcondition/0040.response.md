Output State: **If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, the loop will execute until at least one of them becomes empty. After the loop, if `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` will contain the indices of non-'D' votes updated by `n` for the remaining elements that were not processed. Conversely, if `r_queue` is empty, `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' votes updated by `n` for the remaining elements that were not processed. If either `d_queue` or `r_queue` is empty before the loop starts, the loop does not execute, and both queues remain unchanged. If `votes` is an empty string, both queues will remain empty and the loop will not execute.**
