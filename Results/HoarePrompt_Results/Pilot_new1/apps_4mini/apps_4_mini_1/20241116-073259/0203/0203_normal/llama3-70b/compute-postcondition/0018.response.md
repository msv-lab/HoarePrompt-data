According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be a next character in the string. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 - 1, meaning that the string `fractions` has at least one character. Since the loop processes one character at a time, if `fraction` is currently the last character in the string, there will be no next character, and the loop cannot execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1 greater than the current position of `fraction` in the string. If `fraction` corresponds to the last character in `fractions`, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than the current length of the string, which is `n`. 

Thus, if `fraction` is the last character, we can adjust `n` to be `n + 1`, and `fraction` needs to be the next character in the string `fractions`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fraction` is the next character in the string `fractions`**
