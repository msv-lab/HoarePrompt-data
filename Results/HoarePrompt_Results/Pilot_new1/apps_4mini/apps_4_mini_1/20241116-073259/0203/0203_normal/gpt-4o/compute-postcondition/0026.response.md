Postcondition: ***`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' votes with the first element removed, and `r_queue` is updated with the first element removed. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` is updated by appending `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is updated by appending `r_index + n`. Here, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty user input string, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`. The conditions ensure that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain consistent with the indices of 'D' and 'R' votes respectively.***
