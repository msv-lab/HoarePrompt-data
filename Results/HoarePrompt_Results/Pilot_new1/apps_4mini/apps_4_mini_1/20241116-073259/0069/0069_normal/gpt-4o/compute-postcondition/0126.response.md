The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. 

- `T` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, constrained between 1 and 100.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the binary string `s`, constrained between 1 and 100,000.
- `x` is an integer that can range from -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`, consisting solely of characters '0' and '1'.

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the logic defined within it. However, the exact return value is not specified in the output description provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept the specified parameters and perform operations based on them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (number of test cases), n (length of binary string), x (an integer), and s (a binary string), and processes these inputs according to its internal logic.**
