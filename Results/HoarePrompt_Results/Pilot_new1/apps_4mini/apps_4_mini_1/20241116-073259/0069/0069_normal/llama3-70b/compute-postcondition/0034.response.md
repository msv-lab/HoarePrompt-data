Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s` and `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special handling is necessary to avoid division by zero; if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring all cases are covered, including scenarios where both `cnt0` and `cnt1` are zero.***
