The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The previous values of the affected variables are `balance` is 0, `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` has been appended with `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`. The state of `balance`, `results`, `T`, and `n` remains unchanged, while `x` takes on a new integer value derived from `data[index + 1]`. Therefore, the output state is: `balance` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has been appended with `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`balance` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has been appended with `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]**
