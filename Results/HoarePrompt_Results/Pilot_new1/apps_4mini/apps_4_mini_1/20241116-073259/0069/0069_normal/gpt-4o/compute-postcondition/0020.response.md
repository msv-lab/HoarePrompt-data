Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for `1 <= i <= n`) represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th character of `s`, with `prefix_balances[0]` initialized to 0. The value of `balance` is 0, indicating that the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's is equal up to the current point.***
