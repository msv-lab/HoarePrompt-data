Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is a positive integer (1 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is not equal to `x`, and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1` (i.e., (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1)).***
