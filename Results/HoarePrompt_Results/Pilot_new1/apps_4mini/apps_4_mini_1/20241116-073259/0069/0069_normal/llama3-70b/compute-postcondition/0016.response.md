The values of `n` and `x` are assigned from the input, where `input` accepts two integers separated by a space and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are unknown since they are now assigned new values from the input. The other variables `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments of `n` and `x` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer, `balance` is equal to or not equal to `x`, `cnt0` and `cnt1` values are unchanged**
