The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. The previous state of `data` is not provided, but we know that `index + 1` refers to the next element in the `data` list after `index`. The value of `x` will be determined by the integer conversion of that specific element. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and `prefix_balances` is also unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing cumulative balances of '0's and '1's, initialized to 0 at index 0; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`**
