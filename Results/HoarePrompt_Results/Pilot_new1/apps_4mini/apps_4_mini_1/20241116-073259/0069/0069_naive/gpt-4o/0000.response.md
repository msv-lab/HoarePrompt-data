To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the implementation and identify any potential issues or edge cases.

The problem requires calculating the number of prefixes of an infinite string `t` (formed by concatenating the string `s` infinitely) that have a balance equal to a given value `x`. The balance is defined as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the prefixes.

### Key points to consider:

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the balance of the string `s` as `balance = s.count('0') - s.count('1')`.

2. **Prefix Balances**:
   - The program constructs a list of prefix balances for the string `s`, which is correct.

3. **Infinite Prefixes**:
   - The program checks if the balance of `s` is zero. If it is, it checks if `x` is in the list of prefix balances. If `x` is found, it returns `-1`, indicating infinite prefixes can match the balance. This logic seems appropriate.

4. **Count Calculation**:
   - When the balance is not zero, the program iterates through the prefix balances, checking if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` to count valid prefixes. This logic seems correct for counting valid prefixes based on the balance.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Single Character Strings**:
  - Consider the case where `s = "0"` and `x = 1`. The program should return `0` since there are no prefixes of `t` that can achieve a balance of `1`.
  - For `s = "1"` and `x = 0`, it should return `1`, since the empty prefix has a balance of `0`.

- **Large Values of `x`**:
  - If `x` is much larger than possible balances from `s`, the program should correctly return `0`.

- **Negative Balance**:
  - If the balance is negative, the program should still function correctly when checking for valid prefixes.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, I could not find any input case where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. It handles both the infinite prefix case and the counting of valid prefixes correctly.

Thus, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**.
