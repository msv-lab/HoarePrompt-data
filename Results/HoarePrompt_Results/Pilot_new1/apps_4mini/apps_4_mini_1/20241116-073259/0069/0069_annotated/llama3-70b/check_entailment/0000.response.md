To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and how it aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input/Output Requirements**:
   - We have multiple test cases, each defined by a binary string `s` and an integer `x`.
   - We need to calculate the number of prefixes of an infinite string `t` (constructed by repeating `s` infinitely) that have a balance equal to `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the prefixes.

2. **Special Cases**:
   - If the count of '0's and '1's in `s` is equal, the balance remains constant with each repetition of `s`. If the initial balance (from `s`) is equal to `x`, there are infinitely many valid prefixes. Otherwise, there are none.

### Code Analysis:
The program performs the following steps:
- It counts the occurrences of '0' (`cnt0`) and '1' (`cnt1`) in the string `s`.
- It calculates the initial balance (`balance = cnt0 - cnt1`).
- It checks:
  1. If `balance` equals `x`, it outputs `n + 1` (indicating all prefixes of `s` plus the empty prefix are valid).
  2. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `balance` does not equal `x`, it should ideally output `0` since there would be no valid prefixes.
  3. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `cnt0` does not equal `cnt1`, it checks if the difference can be evenly divided by the balance change per repetition (`(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)`). If it can, it outputs `-1` (indicating infinite valid prefixes), otherwise it computes the number of valid prefixes based on how many repetitions of `s` are needed to reach the balance equal to `x`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Division by Zero**: The code does not handle the case where `cnt0 == cnt1` correctly. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1` but `balance` is not equal to `x`, the program should indicate that there are no valid prefixes, but it does not explicitly handle this case.
2. **Infinite Prefixes**: The condition for infinite prefixes is checked incorrectly. The program outputs `-1` if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, but this should only happen if `cnt0 != cnt1`. If `cnt0 == cnt1`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`, the output should be `0`, not `-1`.

### Conclusion:
Considering the above analysis, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to manage the edge case where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` properly.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

The code does not correctly handle the scenario where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `balance` is not equal to `x`, which leads to an incorrect output in such cases.
