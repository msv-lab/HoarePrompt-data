Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`; `n` and `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that `cnt0 - cnt1` is non-zero to avoid division by zero issues.***
