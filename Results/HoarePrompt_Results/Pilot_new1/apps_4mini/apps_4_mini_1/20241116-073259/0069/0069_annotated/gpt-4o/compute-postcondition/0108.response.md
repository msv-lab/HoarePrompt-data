Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged.***
