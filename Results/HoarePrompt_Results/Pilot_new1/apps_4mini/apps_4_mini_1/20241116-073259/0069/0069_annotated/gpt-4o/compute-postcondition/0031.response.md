Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0 initially. If `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the condition was satisfied. If `(x - b)` is negative or not a multiple of `balance`, `count` remains 0.***
