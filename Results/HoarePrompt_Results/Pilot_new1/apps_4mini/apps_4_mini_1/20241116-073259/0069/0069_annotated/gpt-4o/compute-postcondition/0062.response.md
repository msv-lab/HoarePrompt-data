Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where the first element is 0. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 0 is appended to `results`. This ensures that `results` reflects whether `x` is part of the cumulative balance states represented in `prefix_balances`.***
