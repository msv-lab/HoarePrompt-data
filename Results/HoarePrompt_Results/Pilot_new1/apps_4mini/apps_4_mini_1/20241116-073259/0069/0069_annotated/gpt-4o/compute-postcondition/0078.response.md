Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`; otherwise, 0 is appended. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated based on how many elements in `prefix_balances` satisfy the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. In all cases, the `results` list reflects the outcome based on the conditions evaluated with respect to `prefix_balances` and `x`.***
