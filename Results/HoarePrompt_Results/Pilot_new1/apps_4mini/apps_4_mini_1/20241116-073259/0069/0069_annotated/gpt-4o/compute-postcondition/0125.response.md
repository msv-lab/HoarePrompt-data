Output State: **If T is greater than 0, the loop will print each element in results, which contains the outcomes based on the conditions evaluated with respect to prefix_balances and x. If T is 0, the loop does not execute, and results remains an empty list. If n is 0 or lower, prefix_balances is a list of zeros of length 1, and results will not contain any valid computations to print. In such cases, results is empty, and nothing is printed.**
