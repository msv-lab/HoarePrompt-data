The code appends `-1` to the list `results`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` has -1 appended to it.**
