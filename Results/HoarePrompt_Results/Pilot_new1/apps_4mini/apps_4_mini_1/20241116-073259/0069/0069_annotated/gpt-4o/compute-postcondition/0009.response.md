The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so the new value of `index` becomes 4. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]**
