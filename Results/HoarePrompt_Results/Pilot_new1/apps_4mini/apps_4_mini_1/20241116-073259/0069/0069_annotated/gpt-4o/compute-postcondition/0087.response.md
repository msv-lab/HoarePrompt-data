The variable `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus `1` if the character at `s[i - 1]` is `'0'`, otherwise it will be `-1`. The value of `i` is `1`, so we are looking at `s[0]`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is `prefix_balances[0]`, which is `0` (since it's a list of zeros). 

To determine the new value of `prefix_balances[i]`, we need to check the value of `s[0]`. If `s[0]` is `'0'`, then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `0 + 1 = 1`. If `s[0]` is `'1'`, then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the value of `s[0]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[0]`, which is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1'**
