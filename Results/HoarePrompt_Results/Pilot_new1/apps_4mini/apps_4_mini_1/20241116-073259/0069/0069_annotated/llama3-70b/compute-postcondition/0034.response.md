Postcondition: ***`T` is 100; `n` and `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s'; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s'; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the program prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the program should handle this edge case separately to avoid division by zero, and if it does not lead to a division by zero, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
