According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than or equal to `n`. 

Since the loop starts with `i` at `1` and goes up to `n + 1`, if `i` was equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, it needs to be adjusted to `n + 1` for the loop to execute again. 

Since `prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[0]`, and does not affect the loop's conditions, it does not need to be modified. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[0]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged**
