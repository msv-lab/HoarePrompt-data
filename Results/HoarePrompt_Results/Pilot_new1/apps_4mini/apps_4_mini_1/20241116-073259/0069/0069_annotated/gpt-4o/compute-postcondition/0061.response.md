The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The initial state does not mention any specific values for `results`, but we know that `prefix_balances` is a list where the first element is `0`. Since the code only affects the `results` list and does not change the state of `prefix_balances`, the output state reflects the addition of `0` to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where the first element is 0; `results` now includes an additional element 0.**
