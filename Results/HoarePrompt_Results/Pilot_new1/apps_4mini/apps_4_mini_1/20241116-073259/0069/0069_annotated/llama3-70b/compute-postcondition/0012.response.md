The expression calculates the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. Given that `balance` is defined as `cnt0 - cnt1`, we can substitute that into the expression.

First, we know:
- `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`
- `x - balance` becomes `x - (cnt0 - cnt1)` which simplifies to `x - cnt0 + cnt1`.

Now, we need to evaluate the expression:
- Since `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is not equal to 0 (as per the given conditions), we can safely perform the division.
- The result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` will yield an integer value.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of the expression based on the given variables.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100; `n` and `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`; the output is the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.**
