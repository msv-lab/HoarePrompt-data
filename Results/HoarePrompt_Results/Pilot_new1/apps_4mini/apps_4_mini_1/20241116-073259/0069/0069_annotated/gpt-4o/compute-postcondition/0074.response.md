Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a non-empty collection with at least one element remaining, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, and `count` remains unchanged unless `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` are both true, in which case `count` is increased by 1. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged.***
