Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i - 1`, where `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1. Otherwise, `results` contains an additional element `0`, indicating that `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`. This holds true for all values of `n`, including when `n` is 0, where `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length `1`.***
