The code snippet assigns values to `n` and `x` by reading input and converting the input values to integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and `x` is an integer within a specified range. Since the input is taken from the user, `n` and `x` will now hold the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'**
