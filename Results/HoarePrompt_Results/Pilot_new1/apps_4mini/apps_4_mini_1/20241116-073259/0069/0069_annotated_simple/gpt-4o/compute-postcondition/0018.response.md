According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n + 1` and the loop will not execute again since `i` is already greater than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`; `i` is `n + 1`**
