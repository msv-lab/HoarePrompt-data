Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with each entry representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`. If `balance` is equal to 0, and if `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`, which already contains -1; otherwise, `0` is appended to `results`, resulting in `results` containing -1 and an additional entry of 0. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of entries in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. Throughout this, `T` remains greater than the current iteration count, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop has executed; otherwise, `prefix_balances` remains initialized to zeros.***
