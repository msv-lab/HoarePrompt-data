Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `balance` remains unchanged, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` contains -1 and an additional entry of 0, `count` remains unchanged, `T` remains greater than the current iteration count, `n` is at least 1, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `i` is 1, and `prefix_balances[1]` is updated to `prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[0] == '0' else -1)`**
