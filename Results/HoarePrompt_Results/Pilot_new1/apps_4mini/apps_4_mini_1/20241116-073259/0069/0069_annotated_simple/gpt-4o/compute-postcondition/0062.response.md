Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each entry from `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`, which already contains -1. If `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `0` is appended to `results`, which now contains -1 and an additional entry of 0. `T` remains greater than the current iteration count, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop has executed; otherwise, `prefix_balances` remains initialized to zeros.***
