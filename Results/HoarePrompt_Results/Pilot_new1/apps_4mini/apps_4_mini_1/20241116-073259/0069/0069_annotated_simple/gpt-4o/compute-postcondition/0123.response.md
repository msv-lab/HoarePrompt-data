The code prints the value of `result`. The variable `result` is the third element in the list `results`, and the other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains at least 3 elements, and `result` is the third element in the list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains at least 3 elements, and `result` is the third element in the list**
