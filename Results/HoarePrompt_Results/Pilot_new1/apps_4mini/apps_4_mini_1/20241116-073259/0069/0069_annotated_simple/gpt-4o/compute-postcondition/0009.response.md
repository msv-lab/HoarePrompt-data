The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `data`, and `results`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of input values, `index` is 4, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of input values, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list**
