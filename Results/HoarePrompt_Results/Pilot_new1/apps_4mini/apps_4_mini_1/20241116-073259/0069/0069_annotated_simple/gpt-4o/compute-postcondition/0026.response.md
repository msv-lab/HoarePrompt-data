Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each element `prefix_balances[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i - 1`, and `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, updating each `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous balance and the character at `s[i - 1]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length `1` and `balance` is not equal to 0.***
