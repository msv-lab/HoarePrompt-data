Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and the difference `(x - balance)` is evenly divisible by the difference in counts of '0's and '1's (`cnt0 - cnt1`), the function prints -1. In all other cases, the function computes and prints the value of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that the calculations handle the edge cases of divisibility and the potential zero difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1` appropriately.***
