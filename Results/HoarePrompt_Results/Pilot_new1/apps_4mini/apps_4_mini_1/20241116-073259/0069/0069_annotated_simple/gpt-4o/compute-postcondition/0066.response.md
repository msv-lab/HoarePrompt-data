Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with at least one entry, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is the last updated value in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `count` is initialized to 0, `b` is the first entry in `prefix_balances`, and the value of `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` with a non-negative quotient.***
