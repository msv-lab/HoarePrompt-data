Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `(x - b)` is not a multiple of `balance` or results in a negative quotient when divided by `balance`, `count` remains unchanged.***
