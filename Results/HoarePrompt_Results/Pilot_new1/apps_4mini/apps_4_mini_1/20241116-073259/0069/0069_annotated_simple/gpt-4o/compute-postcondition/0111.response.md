Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`, and `count` remains unchanged unless `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, in which case `count` is increased by 1. This accounts for the scenario where `x` is equal to `b`, or when `x` is greater than `b` such that the difference is a non-negative multiple of `balance`.***
