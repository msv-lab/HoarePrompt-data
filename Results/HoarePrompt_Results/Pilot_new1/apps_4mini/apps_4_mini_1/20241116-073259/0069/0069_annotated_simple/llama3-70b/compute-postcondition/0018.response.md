The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The initial state mentions that `s` is an input string, which means the counts will depend on the content of `s`. The variable `balance` is not directly affected by this line of code, but it is dependent on `cnt0` and `cnt1`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the counts based on the input string.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `s` is an input string.**
