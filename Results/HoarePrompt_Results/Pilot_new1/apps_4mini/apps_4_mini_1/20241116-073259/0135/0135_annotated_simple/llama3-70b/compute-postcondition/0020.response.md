The code adds `remainder` to the set `seen`. The previous value of `remainder` is `n % 3`, and since it was not already in `seen`, it will now be included. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, which is `n % 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, which is `n % 3**
