Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it checks for duplicate remainders when dividing `n` by each integer from 1 to `k`. If a duplicate remainder is found, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `k` is not within the specified range. **
