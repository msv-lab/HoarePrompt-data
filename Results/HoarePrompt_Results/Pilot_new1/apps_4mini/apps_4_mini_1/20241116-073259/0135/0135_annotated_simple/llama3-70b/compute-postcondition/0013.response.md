Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is now `n % 2`. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution without printing or exiting.***
