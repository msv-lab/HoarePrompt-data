According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Since `k` is already greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 3 to allow for the next iteration. Therefore, we adjust `k` to be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is now `n % 2**
