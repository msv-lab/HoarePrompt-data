The code contains a print statement that outputs the string 'Yes'. The initial state indicates that if `k` is at least 1, the loop has executed and `seen` contains unique remainders; otherwise, `seen` is an empty set. However, since the print statement does not change any variable values, the output state will reflect the unchanged state of `seen` and the action performed by the print statement.

Output State: **`seen` contains unique remainders from n % 1 to n % k or `seen` is an empty set; the output is 'Yes'**
