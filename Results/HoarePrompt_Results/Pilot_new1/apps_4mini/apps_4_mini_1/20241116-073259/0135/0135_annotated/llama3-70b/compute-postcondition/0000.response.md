The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and converts them to integers. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^18, they will be replaced by the input integers. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer**
