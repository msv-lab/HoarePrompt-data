According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`. 

Since `n` does not influence the execution of the loop and `seen_remainders` is an empty set, the important states to adjust are `k` and `i`. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and we can initialize `i` to 1 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
