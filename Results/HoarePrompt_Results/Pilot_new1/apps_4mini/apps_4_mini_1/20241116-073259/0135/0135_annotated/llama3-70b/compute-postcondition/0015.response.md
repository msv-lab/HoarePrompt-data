According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, `k` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3**
