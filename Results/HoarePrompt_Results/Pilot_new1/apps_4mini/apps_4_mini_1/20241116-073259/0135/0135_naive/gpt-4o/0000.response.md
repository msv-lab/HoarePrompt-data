To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to check if all remainders of `n` divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The expected output is "Yes" if they are distinct and "No" otherwise.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Immediate Check**: If `k >= n`, the function returns "No". This is because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders when dividing `n` by `1` and `n` will be the same (both will yield `0` when `i=n`).
3. **Remainder Calculation**: The program uses a loop to calculate the remainder `n % i` for each `i` from `1` to `k`. It checks if this remainder has already been seen using a set `seen_remainders`.
4. **Distinct Check**: If a remainder is found in the set, it returns "No". If all remainders are distinct, it returns "Yes".

### Edge Cases
- **When `k < n`**: The program will correctly check for distinct remainders up to `k`.
- **When `k = n`**: The program will return "No", which is correct since `n % n` will be `0`.
- **When `k = 1`**: The program will return "Yes" since there is only one remainder (which is `0`).
- **When `k` is very large**: The program will still function correctly as it checks up to `k`.

### Potential Issue
However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation:
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n` properly in terms of distinctness. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the remainders would be:
  - `5 % 1 = 0`
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  All remainders are distinct in this case, and the output should be "Yes". But if `k` were to be `4`, it would yield:
  - `5 % 3 = 2`
  - `5 % 4 = 1`
  All these are distinct too, but the program does not account for the fact that as `k` increases, the distinctness needs to be checked for all values up to `k`.

### Conclusion
The program incorrectly returns "No" when `k >= n`, which is not a valid conclusion as shown in the examples. Therefore, it fails to correctly handle the requirement of the problem description in certain cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Failure
For input `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the function will incorrectly return "No" instead of "Yes", as it will not check for distinct remainders beyond `n`.
