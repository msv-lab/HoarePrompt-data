The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `i` is 1. Therefore, `remainder` will be equal to `n % 1`, which is always 0 for any integer `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0**
