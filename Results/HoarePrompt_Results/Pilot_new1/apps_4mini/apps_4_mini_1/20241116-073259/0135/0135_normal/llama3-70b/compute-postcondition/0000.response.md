The code assigns values to `n` and `k` using input values that are both integers. The ranges for `n` and `k` are given as 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, meaning both variables will be assigned integer values within this range based on user input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
