According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 to `k + 1`. The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`. 

Since `n` does not affect the execution of the loop but `seen_remainders` is an empty set and does not impact the loop execution either, we only need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run. At the start of the first iteration, `i` will be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
