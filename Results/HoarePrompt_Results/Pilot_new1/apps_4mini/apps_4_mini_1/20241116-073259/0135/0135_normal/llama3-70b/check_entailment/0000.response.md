To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its functionality in relation to the requirements.

### Problem description:
The task is to check whether all remainders of dividing `n` by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. This means that for any pair `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`, the condition `n % i ≠ n % j` should hold.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
seen = set()
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    remainder = n % i
    if remainder in seen:
        print('No')
        exit()
    seen.add(remainder)
print('Yes')
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Remainder Calculation**: It iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` when divided by `i`.
3. **Checking for Duplicates**: It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the remainders. If it finds a remainder that has already been recorded in the set, it prints 'No' and exits.
4. **Output**: If no duplicates are found after checking all remainders, it prints 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case when `k = 1`**: The program should return 'Yes' because there is only one remainder (`n % 1`), which is always `0`.
- **Case when `k = n`**: The program should correctly compute distinct remainders for values from `1` to `n`, which can potentially have duplicates.
- **Large Values**: The program should handle the maximum constraints (`1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`) efficiently.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function checks for duplicate remainders and prints 'No' if any duplicates are found; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. It also notes that if `k` is less than `1`, it directly prints 'Yes'. 

### Evaluation of Output Hints:
- The statement regarding `k < 1` doesn't seem to apply since the problem guarantees that `k` is at least `1`. Therefore, this part of the output hints is irrelevant.
- The hints correctly summarize the function's behavior regarding duplicate remainders.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the general case of checking distinct remainders correctly. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where `k` is less than `1`, though it is guaranteed by the problem constraints that `k` will always be at least `1`. 

Despite this, we can find a flaw in the logic when `k` is equal to `n`. In this case, the remainders may not be distinct due to properties of modular arithmetic. For example, `n % i` will yield the same result for `i` and `n` when `i` is a divisor of `n`.

### Final Assessment:
The program does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description since it does not correctly address the relationship between `n` and `k` when they are equal or when `k` is significantly larger than `n`. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for cases where `k` is greater than `n`, leading to potential duplicate remainders. For instance, if `n = 4` and `k = 4`, it returns 'No', which is correct, but for `n = 5` and `k = 5`, it may not handle all distinct checks correctly, especially since `n` can yield the same remainders for different `i` values, leading to incorrect conclusions.
