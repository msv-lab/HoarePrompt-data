The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case_1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return anything, and the program continues without a return value.
  
- In Case_2, if `k` is at least 1, the function calculates the unique remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If during this calculation a remainder is found in the set of unique remainders, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than 1, no calculations are performed, and the set remains empty.

- In Case_3, if none of the previous conditions trigger a return, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, check specific conditions based on their values, and return 'No' or 'Yes' based on those conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters n and k. If k is greater than or equal to n, it returns 'No'. If k is less than n and no duplicate remainders are found during calculations, it returns 'Yes'. If a duplicate remainder is found, it returns 'No'.**
