Output State: **`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) and any element `x` in `assigned` is found in `assigned`. If no such difference exists after checking all elements in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. `assigned` includes at least `a[i]`, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.**
