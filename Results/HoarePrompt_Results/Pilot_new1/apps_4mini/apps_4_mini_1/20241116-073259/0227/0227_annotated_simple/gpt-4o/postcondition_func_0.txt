The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`. It returns the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned elements from the list. The function starts by sorting `a` and initializes the count with the first element. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 since there are no other elements to form a sum. If `n` is greater than 1, it checks each subsequent element against previously assigned elements to determine if it can be formed by the sum of any two of them, incrementing the count `m` accordingly.
