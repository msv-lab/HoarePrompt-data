The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and the parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`, and return the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of n distinct integers a, and returns the count of elements in a that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned elements.**
