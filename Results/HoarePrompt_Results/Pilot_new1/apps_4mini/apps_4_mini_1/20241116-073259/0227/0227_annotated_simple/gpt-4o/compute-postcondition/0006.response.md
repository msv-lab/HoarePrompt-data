According to the code, the loop will execute if the `assigned` variable contains at least one element. Given that `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, it indicates that `assigned` is not empty, allowing the loop to execute. 

The state of `x` at the start of the loop will be the first element of `assigned`, which is `a[0]`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, and `can_form`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly in this context.

Thus, the states can remain as they are, but we need to clarify the state of `x` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is `a[0]`**
