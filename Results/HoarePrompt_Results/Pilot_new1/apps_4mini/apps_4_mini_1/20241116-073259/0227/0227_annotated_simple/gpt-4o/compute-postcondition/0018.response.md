Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least 3 distinct integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the third element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
