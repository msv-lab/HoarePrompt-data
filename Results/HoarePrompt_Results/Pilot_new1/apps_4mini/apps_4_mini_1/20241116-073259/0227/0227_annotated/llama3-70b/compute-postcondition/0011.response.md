According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1` since the range for `i` is from 1 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently 1, and `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 2 to ensure that `i` can increment and the loop can execute again. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to 2. The condition for `m` to be updated depends on the values in the list `a`. Since the state does not specify the specific values of `a`, we cannot adjust `m` without more information. However, we can state that `m` could remain either 2 or be incremented to 3 depending on the comparison of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2**
