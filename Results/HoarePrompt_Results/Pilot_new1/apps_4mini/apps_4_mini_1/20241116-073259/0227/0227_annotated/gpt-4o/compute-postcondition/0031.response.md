Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` includes `a[1]`, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `x` is `a[1]`, and if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False and `m` is unchanged.***
