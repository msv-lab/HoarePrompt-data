The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown, so we cannot specify its new value. The other variables (`assigned` and `can_form`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `assigned` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a`, `can_form` is False, and `m` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`assigned` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a`, `can_form` is False, and `m` is increased by 1**
