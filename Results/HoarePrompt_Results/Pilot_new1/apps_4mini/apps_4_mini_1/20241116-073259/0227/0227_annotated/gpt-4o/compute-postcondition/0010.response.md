Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, and `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` does not exist in `assigned`, the values of `can_form`, `assigned`, `x`, `m`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
