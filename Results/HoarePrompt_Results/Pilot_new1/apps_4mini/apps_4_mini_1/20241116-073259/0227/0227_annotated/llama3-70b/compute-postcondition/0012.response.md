The value of `m` is incremented by 1. Since `m` can be either 2 or 3, the new value of `m` will be either 3 or 4. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is either 3 or 4, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is either 3 or 4, `i` is 2**
