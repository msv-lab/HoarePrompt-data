Output State: **If `assigned` is empty, then `can_form` is False, and `m` is increased by 1; `assigned` now contains the element `a[i]`, and the state of `m` and `can_form` may have changed accordingly. If `i` is out of bounds, it may cause an error, but does not affect the state of `m` or `can_form`.**
