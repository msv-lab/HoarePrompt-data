The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The variable `assigned` remains a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `i` is still 3, and `x` is the fourth element in the `assigned` list. Therefore, the output state is: `assigned` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `x` is the fourth element in the `assigned` list, and `can_form` is True.

Output State: **`assigned` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `x` is the fourth element in the `assigned` list, and `can_form` is True**
