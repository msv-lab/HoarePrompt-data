Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` includes `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and at least one more distinct integer, `m` is unchanged, `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
