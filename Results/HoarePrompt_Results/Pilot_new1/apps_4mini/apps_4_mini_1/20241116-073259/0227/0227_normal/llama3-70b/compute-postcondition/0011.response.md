According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 to allow for another iteration.

Since `n` is at least 2, it does not guarantee that the loop can execute again. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 3**
