Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean indicating whether there exists an element in `assigned` such that `a[3] - x` is in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is 3, `assigned` contains at least one element (specifically `a[3]`), and `n` is greater than 3.***
