The function `func` accepts no parameters but reads input from the user, specifically a positive integer `n` followed by a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list and counts how many elements are not exactly double the previous element in the sorted list, starting from the second element. If `n` is 1, the count remains 1 since there are no previous elements to compare. After the loop, if the count `m` is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. 

It is important to note that the function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` exceeds 23, as it assumes that the input will be valid based on the description. The functionality of the function is to count elements in the sorted list that do not follow the doubling condition and return that count unless it exceeds 23, in which case it returns -1.

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers, counts how many elements are not double the previous element in the sorted list, and prints that count if it is 23 or less; otherwise, it prints -1. **
