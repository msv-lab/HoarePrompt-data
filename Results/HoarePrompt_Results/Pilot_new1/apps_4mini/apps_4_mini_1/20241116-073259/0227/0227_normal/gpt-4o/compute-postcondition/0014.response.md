Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, and `x` is `a[1]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains undefined, and the program continues execution based on the surrounding context.***
