Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `can_form` is set to True if the difference between `a[i]` (where `i` is 3 and `x` is the third element in `assigned`) and `x` exists in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains unchanged. The values of `m` and `can_form` are preserved unless the condition is satisfied, in which case `can_form` is updated to True.***
