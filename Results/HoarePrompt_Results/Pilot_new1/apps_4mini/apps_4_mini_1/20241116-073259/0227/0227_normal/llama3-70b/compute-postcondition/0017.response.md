The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 23\). The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct positive integers where each integer \(a_k\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_k \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the logic implemented within the function. 

However, since the output details are not provided, we will summarize the functionality based on the accepted parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9).**
