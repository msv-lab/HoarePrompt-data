The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`. Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least one element (specifically `a[3]`), `n` is greater than 3, `can_form` is True, and the value of `a[3] - x` is an element in `assigned`.
