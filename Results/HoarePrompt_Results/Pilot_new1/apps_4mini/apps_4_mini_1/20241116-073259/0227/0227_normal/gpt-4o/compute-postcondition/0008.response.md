The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, so it changes from `False` to `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`, and the difference `a[i] - x` is an element of `assigned`.
