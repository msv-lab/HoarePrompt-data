Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least two elements, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the second element in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `can_form` remains unchanged (False or True depending on previous conditions).***
