The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and since `m` is initially 2, after execution, `m` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 3, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 3, `i` is 2**
