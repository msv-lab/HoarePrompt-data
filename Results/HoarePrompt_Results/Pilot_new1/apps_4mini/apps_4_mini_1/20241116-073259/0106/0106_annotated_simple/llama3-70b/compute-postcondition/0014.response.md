Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum block time based on the difference between the blocks of `a` and `b`, and the minimum floor time based on the difference between their respective floors. It then prints the total time, which is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. The function assumes `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers within specified ranges. However, if `a_floor` is not greater than `b_floor`, the calculation of `min_floor_time` may not be valid, leading to potential issues if `b_floor` is undefined.**
