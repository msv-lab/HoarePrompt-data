Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment`, calculates the corresponding `block` and `floor` based on the apartment number, and returns these values. The function assumes that the variables `m` and `k` are defined elsewhere in the code and does not handle cases where `apartment` is less than 1, which could lead to incorrect calculations or undefined behavior.**
