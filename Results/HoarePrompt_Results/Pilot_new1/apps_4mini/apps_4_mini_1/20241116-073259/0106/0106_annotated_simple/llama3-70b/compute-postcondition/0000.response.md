The code assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `k` by mapping the input values to these variables. The input will be processed as integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not known, as they are being replaced by the input values. The variables `a` and `b` remain unaffected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `k` now hold new values based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are input positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k**
