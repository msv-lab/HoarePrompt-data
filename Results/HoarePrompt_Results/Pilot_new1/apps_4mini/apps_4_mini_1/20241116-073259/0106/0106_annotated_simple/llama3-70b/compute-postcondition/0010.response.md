The variable `min_floor_time` is assigned the value of the expression `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. However, since `b_floor` is based on an undefined value of `b`, we cannot determine its value. The variable `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, but without specific values for `a_floor` and `b_floor`, we cannot calculate `min_floor_time`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `min_floor_time` cannot be calculated due to the undefined nature of `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are input positive integers, `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_block` is based on an undefined value of `b`, `min_block_time` cannot be calculated, `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, and `min_floor_time` cannot be calculated due to undefined `b_floor`.**
