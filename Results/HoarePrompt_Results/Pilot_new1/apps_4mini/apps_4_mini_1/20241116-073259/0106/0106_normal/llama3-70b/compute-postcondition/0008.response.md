The calculation for `min_floor_time` is based on the difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor`. The formula used is `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, the result of `a_floor - b_floor` will be a positive value. 

Since the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their previous values, they do not affect this calculation directly. The output state will reflect the updated value of `min_floor_time` based on the calculation performed.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` retain their previous values; `a_block` is calculated from user input values of `a` and `m`; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
