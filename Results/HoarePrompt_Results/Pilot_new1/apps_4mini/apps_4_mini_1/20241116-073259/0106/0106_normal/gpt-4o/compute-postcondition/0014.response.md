Functionality: ** The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the total time required to exit from apartment `a` and reach apartment `b`, considering the time to exit the floor, the walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The total time is computed as the sum of the exit time, the minimum walking time (either direct or reverse), and the time to reach the target floor. The function does not handle any edge cases related to invalid apartment numbers or negative values for `n`, `m`, and `k`.**
