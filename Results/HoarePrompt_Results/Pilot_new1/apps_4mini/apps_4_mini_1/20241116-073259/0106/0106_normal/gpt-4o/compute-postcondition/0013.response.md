The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers that represent dimensions, constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers, constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. After executing the function body, it returns the total time calculated based on the values of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return the total time based on specific calculations involving these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b, and returns the total time calculated based on time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.**
