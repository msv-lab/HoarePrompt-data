The variable `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` depend on the previously calculated values based on the apartment numbers and the number of blocks. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `min_walk_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an apartment number; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
