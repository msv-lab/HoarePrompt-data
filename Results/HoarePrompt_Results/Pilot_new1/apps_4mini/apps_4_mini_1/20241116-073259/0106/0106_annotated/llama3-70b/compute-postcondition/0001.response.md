The values of `a` and `b` are assigned from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `a` and `b` will take on new integer values based on the user's input, while the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not specified, but they were distinct integers within the range 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from input; `a` and `b` are new input integers**
