The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which are positive integers within the range specified (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000). The variables `a` and `b` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state indicates that `n`, `m`, and `k` have been assigned new values based on the input, while `a` and `b` retain their previous distinct integer values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.**
