The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer representing an apartment number, constrained such that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k, where n, m, and k are positive integers with values between 1 and 1000. The function calculates and returns the values of `block` and `floor` based on the apartment number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding `block` and `floor` values based on its calculations.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the apartment number provided.**
