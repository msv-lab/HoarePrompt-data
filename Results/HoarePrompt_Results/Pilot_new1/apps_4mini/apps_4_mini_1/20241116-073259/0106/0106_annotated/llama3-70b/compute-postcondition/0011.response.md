Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from input; `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated based on input values. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. Otherwise, if `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In both cases, `min_floor_time` will always be at least 10, accounting for the time taken to reach the first floor.***
