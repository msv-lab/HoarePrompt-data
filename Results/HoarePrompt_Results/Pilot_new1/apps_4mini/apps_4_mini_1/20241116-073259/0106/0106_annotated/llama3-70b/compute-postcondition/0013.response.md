The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates with the following constraints: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details about the output, we cannot determine the specific functionality of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates with positive integers n, m, k, and distinct integers a and b within specified ranges; the output is not defined.**
