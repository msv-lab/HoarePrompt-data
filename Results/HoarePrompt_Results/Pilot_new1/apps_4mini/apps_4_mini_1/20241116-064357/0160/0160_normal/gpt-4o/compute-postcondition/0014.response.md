According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` to allow for one more iteration.

The value of `x` is not specified directly in the state, but since `i` is derived from `x`, we can infer that the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `divisors` remains unchanged.**
