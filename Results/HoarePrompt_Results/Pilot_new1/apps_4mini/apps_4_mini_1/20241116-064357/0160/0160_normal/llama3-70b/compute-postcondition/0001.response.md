The variable `A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values split by whitespace. The value of `N` indicates the number of integers that will be provided as input, but the specific values of those integers are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `A` is a list of integers based on the user input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, and `A` is a list of integers from user input**
