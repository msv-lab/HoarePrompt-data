According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` to reflect that the loop has completed its iterations.

Since `x` is not mentioned to change and remains the same, we do not need to adjust any other states. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `divisors` is a set that contains `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
