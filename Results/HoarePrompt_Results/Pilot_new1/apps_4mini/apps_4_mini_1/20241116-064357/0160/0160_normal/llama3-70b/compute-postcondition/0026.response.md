The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to `(current_value + 1)`, the division `gcd // i` will yield a value that is at least 1 (assuming `i` is a positive integer). The previous value of `max_divisor` is compared with this new value to determine the updated state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `max_divisor` based on the maximum calculation.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to `(current_value + 1)`; `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`**
