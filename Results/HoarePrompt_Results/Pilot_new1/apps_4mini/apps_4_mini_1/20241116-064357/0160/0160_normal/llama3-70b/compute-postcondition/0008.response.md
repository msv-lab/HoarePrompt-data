The `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the previous `gcd` and `A[3]`. The value of `i` is 3, so we are specifically looking at the fourth element in the list `A`. The previous value of `gcd` is not specified but is carried over from the initial state. The value of `A[3]` is also not specified but is an integer from the list `A`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `gcd` is updated based on its previous value and the value at index 3 of list `A`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least `N` elements, `gcd` is updated to gcd of previous `gcd` and `A[3]`, `i` is 3**
