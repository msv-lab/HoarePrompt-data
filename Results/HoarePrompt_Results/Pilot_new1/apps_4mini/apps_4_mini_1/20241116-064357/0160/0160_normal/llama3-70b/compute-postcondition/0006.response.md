The value of `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[i]`. The previous value of `gcd` is the gcd of `A[0]` and `A[1]`, and `A[i]` is the third element of the list `A` since `i` is 2. The values of `N`, `K`, and the list `A` remain unchanged, but `gcd` now reflects the new calculation.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least `N` elements, `gcd` is updated to gcd of previous `gcd` and `A[i]`, `i` is 2**
