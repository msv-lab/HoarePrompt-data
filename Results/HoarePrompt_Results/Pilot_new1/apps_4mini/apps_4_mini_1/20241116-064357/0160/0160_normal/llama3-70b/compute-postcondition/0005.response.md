According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2. Since `N` is at least 2, the condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied. 

No other states need to be adjusted because `K`, `A`, and `gcd` are not directly affected by the loop condition.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least `N` elements, `gcd` is updated to gcd of `A[0]` and `A[1]`, and `i` is 2**
