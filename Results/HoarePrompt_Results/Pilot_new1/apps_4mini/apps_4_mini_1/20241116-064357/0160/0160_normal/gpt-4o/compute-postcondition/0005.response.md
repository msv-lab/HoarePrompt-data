Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `divisors` is a set that contains `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is at least 1 and `i` is 1, then `divisors` will include both 1 and `x`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged.***
