The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. The variable `i` has been incremented to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, but the exact value of `i` and `max_divisor` before this operation is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_divisor` has been updated based on the comparison with `i`. 

Output State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `max_divisor` is updated as necessary, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1, and `max_divisor` is now the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
