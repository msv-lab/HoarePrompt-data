Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and `x` is at least (int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` includes both `i` and `x // i`. There are no changes to `divisors` if `x` is not divisible by `i`.***
