Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, and `i` is an integer calculated as `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. Thus, `max_divisor` reflects the largest divisor of `gcd` found up to `i`.***
