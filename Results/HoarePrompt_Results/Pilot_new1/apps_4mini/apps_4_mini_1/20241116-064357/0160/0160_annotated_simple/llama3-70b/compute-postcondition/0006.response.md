The value of `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the element `A[i]`. The initial value of `gcd` is `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`, and `i` is 2, which means we are now calculating `gcd` with `A[2]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `gcd` (which is the GCD of the first two elements of `A`) and `A[i]` (the third element of `A`). 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers from input, `gcd` is the GCD of `A[0]`, `A[1]`, and `A[2]`, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers from input, `gcd` is the GCD of `A[0]`, `A[1]`, and `A[2]`, `i` is 2**
