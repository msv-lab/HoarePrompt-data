The variable `gcd` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of the current value of `gcd` and `A[i]`. The previous value of `gcd` is `A[0]`, and `i` is 1, so `A[i]` is `A[1]`. Therefore, the new value of `gcd` will be `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers from input, `gcd` is math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), `i` is 1**
