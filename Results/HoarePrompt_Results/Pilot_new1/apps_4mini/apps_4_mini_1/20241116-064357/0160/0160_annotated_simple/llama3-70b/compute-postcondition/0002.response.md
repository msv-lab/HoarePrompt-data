The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, which is the first element of the list `A`. Since `A` is a list of `N` integers from input, `A[0]` will be the first integer in that list. The values of `N`, `K`, and the rest of the list `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `gcd` and the existing values of `N`, `K`, and `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers from input, and `gcd` is A[0]**
