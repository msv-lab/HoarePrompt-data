To provide the output state, I need the specific values for `N`, `K`, `A`, and `divisors`, as well as the value of `x` for the code snippet to make sense. However, I can interpret the code snippet provided.

The line `divisors.add(i)` suggests that `i` is being added to the set `divisors`. The context implies that `i` is a divisor of `x`, and the code is likely part of a loop that checks for divisors up to the square root of `x`.

Given that `divisors` is a set, adding `i` will not affect the other variables (`N`, `K`, `A`). The output state will reflect that `i` has been added to `divisors`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and `i` has been added to `divisors`.**
