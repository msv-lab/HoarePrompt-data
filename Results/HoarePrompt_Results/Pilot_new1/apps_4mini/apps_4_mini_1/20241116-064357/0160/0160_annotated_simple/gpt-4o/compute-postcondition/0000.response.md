The variable `divisors` is initialized as an empty set. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of the `divisors` variable.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and `divisors` is an empty set.**
