The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `chosen_route` becomes 0 + 1, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than the original `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than the original `min_wait_time`**.
