The variables `n` and `t` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which is split and converted to integers. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), they will take on specific integer values based on user input. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000)**
