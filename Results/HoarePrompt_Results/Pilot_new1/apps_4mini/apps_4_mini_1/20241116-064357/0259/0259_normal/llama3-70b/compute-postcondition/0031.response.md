According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as the index `i` is less than the length of the `buses` list. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `i` is 2 and `buses` contains at least 3 tuples. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and the current tuple `(s, d)` needs to be the fourth tuple in the `buses` list.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` should be updated to 3, and `(s, d)` should be the fourth tuple in `buses`. The other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`buses` contains at least 3 tuples, `t` is a positive integer, `_` is n, `i` is 3, and `(s, d)` is the fourth tuple in `buses`**
