According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to 2.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `_` should be incremented to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n` remains at least 2, which allows for another iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` now contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d), `_` is 2**
