According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the current iteration index, which is less than `n`. To prepare for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, it must be ensured that `n` remains unchanged. The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`, which will become `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to the next index (i + 1)**.
