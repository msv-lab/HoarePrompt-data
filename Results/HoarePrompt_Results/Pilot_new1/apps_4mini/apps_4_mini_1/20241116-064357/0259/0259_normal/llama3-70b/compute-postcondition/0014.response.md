The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. This does not affect any other variables in the current state, so the output state reflects the assignment of `ans`. 

Output State: **`buses` contains `n` tuples of integers (s, d) where each tuple is input by the user; `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000); `_` is the last index of the loop (n-1); `min_time` is positive infinity; `ans` is -1**
