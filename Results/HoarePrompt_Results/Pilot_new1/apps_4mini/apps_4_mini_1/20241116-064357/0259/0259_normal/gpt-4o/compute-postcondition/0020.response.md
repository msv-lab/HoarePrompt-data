The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, and `wait_time` is now `0`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `wait_time` is 0; `min_wait_time` is unchanged; `chosen_route` is unchanged; `i` is `n`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `wait_time` is 0; `min_wait_time` is unchanged; `chosen_route` is unchanged; `i` is `n`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]**
