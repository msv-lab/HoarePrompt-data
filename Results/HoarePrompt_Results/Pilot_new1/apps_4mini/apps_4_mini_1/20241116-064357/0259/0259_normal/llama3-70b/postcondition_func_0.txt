The function reads an integer `n` (the number of buses) and an integer `t` (a time value) from user input. It then collects `n` pairs of integers `(s, d)` representing the start time and duration of each bus. The function calculates the minimum time until a bus becomes available based on the formula `(t - s) % d` for each bus. It returns the 1-based index of the bus that has the minimum time until it becomes available. If no buses are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), it outputs `-1`. The function does not take parameters or return values explicitly; it only prints the result.
