The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are input integers, so they will be added to the list as a new entry. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `_` are unchanged, and `buses` will now contain one element, which is the tuple `(s, d)`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` now contains one tuple (s, d), `_` is 0**
