Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` remain unchanged; if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, both `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
