To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state.

1. The variable `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from the `bus_routes` list at index `n`. Therefore, `s_i` and `d_i` will hold specific values based on the `bus_routes` list.
2. The expression `(t - s_i) % d_i` calculates the remainder when `t - s_i` is divided by `d_i`.
3. The `wait_time` is then calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

Since `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` are all defined in the initial state, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, `i` is `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[n]`**
