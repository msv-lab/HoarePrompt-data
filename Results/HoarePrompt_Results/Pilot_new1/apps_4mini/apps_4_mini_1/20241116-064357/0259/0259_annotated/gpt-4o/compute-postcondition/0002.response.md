According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` do not need to be adjusted as they are already set correctly to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
