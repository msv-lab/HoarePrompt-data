The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of -1. This does not affect any of the other variables in the state. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `chosen_route` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that (1 ≤ s_i, d_i ≤ 100000), `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1**
