The code appends a tuple (s, d) to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from input values, and since `buses` is initially a list containing one tuple, it will now contain two tuples after the execution of the code. The other variables (`n`, `t`, and `_`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing two tuples (the original tuple and the newly appended tuple (s, d)), and `_` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing two tuples (the original tuple and (s, d)), `_` is 1**
