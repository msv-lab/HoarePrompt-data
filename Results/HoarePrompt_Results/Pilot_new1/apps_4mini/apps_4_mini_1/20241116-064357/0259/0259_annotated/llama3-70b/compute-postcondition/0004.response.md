The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The previous state indicates that `buses` is currently an empty list. After executing the code, `buses` will contain one element, which is the tuple formed by the values of `s` and `d`. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list of buses.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple (s, d), `_` is 0**
