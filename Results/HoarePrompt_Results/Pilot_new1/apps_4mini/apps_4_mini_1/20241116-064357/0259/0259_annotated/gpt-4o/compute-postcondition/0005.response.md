The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous values are still valid. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculated `wait_time` based on the values of `s_i` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.**
