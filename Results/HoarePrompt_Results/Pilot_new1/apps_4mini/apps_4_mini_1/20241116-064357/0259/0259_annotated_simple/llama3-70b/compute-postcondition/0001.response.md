The code initializes an empty list `buses`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, which remains unchanged, and `t`, which also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `buses` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `buses` is an empty list**
