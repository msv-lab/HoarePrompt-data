The line `s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]` assigns the values from the `bus_routes` list at index `i` to the variables `s_i` and `d_i`. The variable `i` is currently 1, so the values assigned to `s_i` and `d_i` depend on the contents of `bus_routes` at that index. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `bus_routes`, we cannot determine the exact values of `s_i` and `d_i`. Therefore, the output state will indicate that the values of `s_i` and `d_i` are now assigned based on the data from `bus_routes` at index 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`**
