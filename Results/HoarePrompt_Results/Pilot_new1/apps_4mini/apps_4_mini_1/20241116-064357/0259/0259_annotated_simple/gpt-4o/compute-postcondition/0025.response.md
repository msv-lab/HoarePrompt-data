The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `chosen_route` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`**
