The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are given, but we do not have the specific values for `s_i` or `t`. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact value of `wait_time`. The other variables remain unaffected. The output state reflects that `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `s_i` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`, `i` is `n - 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n - 1], and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.**
