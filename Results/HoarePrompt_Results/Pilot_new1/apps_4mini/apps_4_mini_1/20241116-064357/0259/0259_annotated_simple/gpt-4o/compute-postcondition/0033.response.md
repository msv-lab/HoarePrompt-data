Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is `n - 1`, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n - 1]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, indicating the wait time until the bus departs. If `t` aligns perfectly with the bus schedule, meaning `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0, indicating no wait time is needed. In the case where `t` does not align perfectly, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives. In all cases, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than its previous value, ensuring that `min_wait_time` reflects the shortest wait time calculated.***
