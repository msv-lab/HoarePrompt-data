The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing a time value, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` that define the start and destination of each bus route. After executing the function body, it returns the index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time, referred to as `chosen_route`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of bus routes, and return the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (time value), and bus_routes (list of tuples defining bus routes), and returns the index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time.**
