The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input, which are converted to integers using the `map(int, input().split())` function. The values of `s` and `d` will be determined by the user input. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `buses`, and `_`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the input values of `s` and `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing two tuples: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is `n`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
