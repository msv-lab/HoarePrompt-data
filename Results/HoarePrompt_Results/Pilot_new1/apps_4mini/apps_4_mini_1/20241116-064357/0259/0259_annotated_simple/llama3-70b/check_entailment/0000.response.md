To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` (number of bus routes) and `t` (the time Serval arrives at the bus station). It then reads `n` pairs of integers `(s_i, d_i)` which represent the first arrival time and the interval for each bus route.

2. **Bus Arrival Calculation**: The program calculates the time until the next bus for each route using the formula `(t - s) % d`. This formula is intended to find the wait time for the next bus after time `t`. However, there is a crucial flaw here:
   - If `t < s`, the result of `(t - s) % d` will yield a negative wait time, which is not meaningful in the context of bus arrivals. Serval cannot wait for a bus that arrives before he gets there.
   - The correct approach should check if `t` is less than `s`. If it is, the next bus is simply the first bus at time `s`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Wait Time**: The program tracks the minimum wait time across all bus routes and the corresponding index of the bus route. However, due to the incorrect handling of the case where `t < s`, the program may incorrectly identify the bus route.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails
Consider the following input:
```
1 5
10 2
```
In this case:
- There is 1 bus route with the first bus arriving at time `10` and the interval of `2` minutes.
- Serval arrives at time `5`, which is before the first bus arrives.

According to the problem description, since the first bus arrives at `10`, Serval cannot catch any bus, and the correct output should indicate that he cannot catch a bus. However, the program calculates `(5 - 10) % 2`, which results in `1`, leading it to incorrectly suggest that the first bus route is the answer.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle the case where Serval arrives before the first bus, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
