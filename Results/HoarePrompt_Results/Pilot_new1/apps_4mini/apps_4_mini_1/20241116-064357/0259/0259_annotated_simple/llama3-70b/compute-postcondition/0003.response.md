The code assigns values to `s` and `d` by taking input from the user and splitting it into two integers. The values of `s` and `d` will be determined by the user's input. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, and `s` and `d` are input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, and `s` and `d` are input integers.**
