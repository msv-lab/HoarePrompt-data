Output State: **If `buses` is a list containing at least one tuple, `min_time` will be the minimum value of `time` calculated during the loop, which is `(t - s) % d` for the tuples in `buses`. `ans` will be the index (1-based) of the tuple that produced this minimum `time`. If `buses` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains positive infinity and `ans` remains -1.**
