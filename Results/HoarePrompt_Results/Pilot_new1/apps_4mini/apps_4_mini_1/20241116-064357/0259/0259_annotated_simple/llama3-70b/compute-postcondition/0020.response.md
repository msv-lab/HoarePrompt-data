Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, `min_time` is updated to the value of `time` if `time` is less than the previous `min_time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1` (which is 1 in this case). If `time` is not less than `min_time`, then `min_time` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains -1.***
