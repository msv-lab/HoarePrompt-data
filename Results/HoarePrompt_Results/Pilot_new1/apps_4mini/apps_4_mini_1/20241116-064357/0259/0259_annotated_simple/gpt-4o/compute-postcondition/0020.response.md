The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the current value of `wait_time` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is 0**
