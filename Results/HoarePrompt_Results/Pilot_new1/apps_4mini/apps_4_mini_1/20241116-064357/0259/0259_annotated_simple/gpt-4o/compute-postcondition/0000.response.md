The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This indicates that it is initialized to a value that represents the largest possible waiting time before any calculations or comparisons are made. The initial states of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity**
