Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `s` from the user and prints its English word representation for numbers ranging from 0 to 99. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 20 and 99, it constructs the word representation by combining the appropriate entries from the `tens` and `ones` lists, using a hyphen if `s` is not a multiple of 10. The function does not handle inputs outside the range of 0 to 99 and does not return any value; it only prints the output.**
