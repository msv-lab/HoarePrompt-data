Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list corresponding to `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]', thus covering all integers from 10 to 99, including edge cases like 10, 20, ..., 90 for multiples of 10 and 11, 12, ..., 19 for the teens.***
