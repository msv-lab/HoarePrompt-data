To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic in the `func_1` function against the problem description.

The function aims to convert an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its English word representation. The implementation uses three lists:
- `ones`: for numbers 0 to 9,
- `teens`: for numbers 11 to 19, and
- `tens`: for multiples of ten from 10 to 90.

The function checks the input number `n` and returns the appropriate string based on the following conditions:
1. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
2. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list.
3. If `n` is 10 or a multiple of ten (20, 30, ..., 90), it returns the corresponding word from the `tens` list.
4. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of ten, it concatenates the appropriate word from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the corresponding word from the `ones` list.

Now, let's check if there are any edge cases or potential issues:
- The program does not handle the number `10` correctly. The condition for teens does not include `10`, which should return "ten", but it falls into the `elif` block for tens.
- The teen numbers are incorrectly indexed since `teens[0]` is an empty string, which means that when `n` is `10`, it doesn't return anything for the tens place.

Given this logic, the program will incorrectly handle the input `10` and also does not handle the case for `10` correctly.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
