Correctness: **False**

The program has a flaw in the way it handles the input score of `0`. According to the problem description, the output for a score of `0` should be the word "zero". However, the current implementation does not account for this case, as the `ones` list starts from index `1` (with the first element being an empty string). Therefore, when `s` is `0`, `ones[s]` will return an empty string instead of "zero". 

To illustrate:
- Input: `0`
- Expected Output: `zero`
- Actual Output: `''` (empty string)

Since the program fails to correctly convert the score `0` to its English word equivalent, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the program is incorrect.
