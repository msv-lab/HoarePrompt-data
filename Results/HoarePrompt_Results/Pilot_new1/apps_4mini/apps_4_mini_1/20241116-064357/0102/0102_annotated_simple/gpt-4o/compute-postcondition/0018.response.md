The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. The function returns different string representations based on the value of `s`: 

- If `s` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list.
- If `s` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list.
- If `s` is between 10 and 99 and `s` is a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation from the `tens` list.
- If `s` is between 10 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation in the format `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `s` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its string representation based on specific conditions related to its value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is an integer between 0 and 99, and returns its string representation based on whether s is in the ones, teens, or tens category, or a combination of tens and ones.**
