Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the string representation of `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19 (inclusive), it prints the string representation of `s` from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation of `s` in words by concatenating the appropriate string from the `tens` list with the string representation of the unit digit from the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen if the unit digit is not zero. This covers all cases for non-negative integers `s`, but does not handle negative integers or values beyond the defined ranges.***
