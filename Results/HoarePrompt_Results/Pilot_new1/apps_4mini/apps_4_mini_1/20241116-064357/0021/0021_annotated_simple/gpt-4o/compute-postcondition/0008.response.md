The variable `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of these variables are determined by the initial state, where `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`, and `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. Since the exact values of `max_pos` and `min_pos` are not provided, we can only state the relationships.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`; `max_distance` is the maximum of these four distances.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`; `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.**
