To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

In the initial state, we have:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
```

Here, `max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between two expressions:
1. `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`: This calculates the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, subtracting 1 from the result.
2. `n - 2`: This simply subtracts 2 from `n`.

The variables `pos1`, `n`, and `posn` are relevant for this calculation. Since `n` is known to be between 2 and 100, and `posn` is defined as the index of `n` in the list `a`, the specific values of `pos1` and `posn` will determine the output. However, since `pos1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot calculate a specific numeric output for `max_dist`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the known variables and the operation being performed without providing a specific numeric result for `max_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is assigned the maximum of (abs(pos1 - posn) - 1) and (n - 2)**
