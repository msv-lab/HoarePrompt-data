The code assigns a value to `dist3`, which is calculated as the absolute difference between `0` and `min_pos`. However, the value of `min_pos` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `dist3`, but we know that it is dependent on `min_pos`. 

The other variables (`n`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, and `dist2`) remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, `dist1` is `max_pos`, `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, and `dist3` is `abs(0 - min_pos)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, `dist1` is `max_pos`, `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, and `dist3` is `abs(0 - min_pos)`**.
