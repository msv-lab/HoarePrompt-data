To analyze the code snippet provided, we need to look at the variables involved:

1. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
2. `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
3. `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`.
4. `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`, which is equal to `max_pos`.

Now, the code snippet:
```
dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)
```
This line computes `dist2` as the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`.

- Given that `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, we can conclude that `max_pos` must be between `0` and `n-1` (inclusive).
- Therefore, `n - 1 - max_pos` will yield a value that ranges from \(n - 1 - (n - 1) = 0\) to \(n - 1 - 0 = n - 1\).

Thus, `dist2` will be a non-negative integer, specifically the absolute value of the difference calculated.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `max_pos`, and the newly calculated `dist2` based on the previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, `dist1` is `max_pos`, `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos`**
