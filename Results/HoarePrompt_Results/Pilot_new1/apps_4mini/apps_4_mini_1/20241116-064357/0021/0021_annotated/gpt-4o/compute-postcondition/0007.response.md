The variable `dist4` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The values of `n` and `min_pos` are used in this calculation, but the specific values of `n` and `min_pos` are not provided in the initial state. However, `dist4` will be calculated based on the existing values of `n` and `min_pos`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`, and `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`, and `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`**.
