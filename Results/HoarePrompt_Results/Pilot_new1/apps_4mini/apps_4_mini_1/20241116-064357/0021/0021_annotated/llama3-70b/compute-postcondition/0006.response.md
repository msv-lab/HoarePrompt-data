The code prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. Given the initial state, `max_dist` and `min_dist` are already defined based on the positions of `1` and `n` in the array `a`. The values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` are not changed by the print statement, but the result of the calculation is printed.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `max_dist`, `min_dist`, and the result of the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); the result is printed as max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**
