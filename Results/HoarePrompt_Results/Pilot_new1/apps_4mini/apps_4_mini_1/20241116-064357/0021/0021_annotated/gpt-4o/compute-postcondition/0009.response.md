Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`, `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`, and `max_distance` is equal to `max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)`, and the function prints `max_distance`.**
