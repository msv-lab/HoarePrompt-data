The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it reads an integer `n` from standard input, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers. The function identifies the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list and calculates two distances: `max_dist` and `min_dist`. The `max_dist` is determined by the absolute difference between the positions of `1` and `n`, adjusted by subtracting 1, and compared to `n - 2`. The `min_dist` is similarly computed but takes the minimum of the two values. Finally, the function prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and the difference `n - 1 - min_dist`.

Potential edge cases not covered in the annotations include:
1. The function assumes that both `1` and `n` will always be present in the list `a`. If either is missing, a `ValueError` will be raised when calling `index()`.
2. The function does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2, although the provided constraints specify that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`.

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from input, calculates the maximum distance between the positions of `1` and `n`, and prints this value. It assumes that both `1` and `n` are present in the list and does not handle cases where they are missing. **
