The code assigns the value of `max_pos` to be the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The variable `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and since `n` is one of those integers, `max_pos` will be the index where `n` is located in `a`. The value of `min_pos` and the contents of `a` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the new assignment.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`**
