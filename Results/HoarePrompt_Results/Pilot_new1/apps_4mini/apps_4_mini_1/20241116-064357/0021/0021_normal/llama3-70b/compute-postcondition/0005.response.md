To determine the output state, we start by analyzing the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100
- `a` is a list of integers based on input
- `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`
- `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`
- `max_dist` is calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`

The code snippet provided is:
```
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code:
1. The variable `min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.
2. The values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are used to calculate `min_dist`, but none of these variables are modified by this operation.

Since `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are defined in the initial state, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100; `a` is a list of integers based on input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
