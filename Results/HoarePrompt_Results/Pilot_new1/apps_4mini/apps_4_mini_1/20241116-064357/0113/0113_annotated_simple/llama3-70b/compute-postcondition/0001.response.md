The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer between `0` and `8`, the possible values of `x` will be powers of `10` ranging from `1` (when `k` is `0`) to `100000000` (when `k` is `8`). The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the assignment to `x`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
