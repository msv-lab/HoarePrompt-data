The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`. It calculates a `multiplier` as \(10^k\) and then computes `x` as \(n\) multiplied by the result of integer division of `multiplier` by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`. The function ultimately returns this calculated value `x`.

There are no apparent edge cases that affect the calculation, as the GCD function will always return a positive integer when `n` is positive and `multiplier` is a power of 10. However, if `n` were to be zero, which is not allowed per the function's design, it would lead to a GCD of `multiplier`, resulting in `x` being zero. This situation is not handled in the annotations, which assume `n` is always positive.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates `x` as \(n \times (10^k // \text{gcd}(n, 10^k))\), and returns this value. **
