The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `multiplier` will take on values ranging from `1` (when `k` is `0`) to `100000000` (when `k` is `8`). The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), and `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 depending on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), and `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 depending on the value of `k`.**
