The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer constrained between 0 and 8. The function returns the value of `x`, which is calculated as `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The exact value of `multiplier` is not specified in the provided information, but it is used in the calculation of `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return a computed value based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a non-negative integer k, and returns the value of x calculated as n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)).**
