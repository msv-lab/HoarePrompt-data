The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is in the range from 3 to 10^9 + 2 and `n % x != 0`, the new value of `n` will be within the same range but increased by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is in the range 4 to 10^9 + 3, and `n % x` remains not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 4 to 10^9 + 3, and `n % x` is not equal to 0**
