The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). After executing the function body, it returns the value of `x`, which is calculated as \(n \times \left(\frac{\text{multiplier}}{\text{math.gcd}(n, \text{multiplier})}\right)\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return the computed value of `x` based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer), and returns the value of `x` calculated as \(n \times \left(\frac{\text{multiplier}}{\text{math.gcd}(n, \text{multiplier})}\right)\).**
