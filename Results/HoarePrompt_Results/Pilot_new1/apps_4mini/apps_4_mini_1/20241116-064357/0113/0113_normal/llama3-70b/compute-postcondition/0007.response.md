According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `n % x != 0`. For the loop to execute again, `n % x` must remain not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is in the range from 4 to 10^9 + 3, and it is already stated that `n % x` is not equal to 0. 

Since there are no constraints indicating that `n` must change or that `x` must be adjusted, and given that `n` is still within the specified range, the state can remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is in the range 4 to 10^9 + 3, and `n % x` is not equal to 0**
