The value of `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\), the possible values of `x` can range from \(10^0 = 1\) to \(10^8 = 100000000\). The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `k` is an input non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\), and `x` is \(10^k\).

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is 10^k**
