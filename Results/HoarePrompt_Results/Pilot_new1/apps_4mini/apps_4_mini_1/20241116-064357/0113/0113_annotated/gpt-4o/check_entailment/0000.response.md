To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its annotations carefully.

The problem description states that for a given positive integer \( n \) and a non-negative integer \( k \), we are to find the minimum positive integer \( x \) such that \( x \) ends with \( k \) or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by \( n \).

### Code Analysis

The code provided is as follows:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
```

1. **Multiplier Calculation**: The variable `multiplier` is set to \( 10^k \). This correctly represents the smallest number that has at least \( k \) trailing zeros.

2. **Calculation of \( x \)**: The value of \( x \) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   x = n \times \left(\frac{10^k}{\text{gcd}(n, 10^k)}\right)
   \]
   This formula ensures that \( x \) is divisible by \( n \) and also ends with at least \( k \) zeros, as multiplying by \( 10^k \) guarantees the trailing zeros.

### Edge Cases and Annotations

- The annotations mention that the function does not handle cases where `n` is zero or negative. However, the problem description specifies that \( n \) is a positive integer, which means that negative or zero values for \( n \) should not occur in valid input based on the constraints provided (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

- The examples provided in the problem description are:
  - Input: `375 4` → Output: `30000`
  - Input: `10000 1` → Output: `10000`
  - Input: `38101 0` → Output: `38101`
  - Input: `123456789 8` → Output: `12345678900000000`

### Verification Against Examples

1. For the input `375 4`:
   - \( n = 375 \), \( k = 4 \)
   - \( 10^4 = 10000 \)
   - \( \text{gcd}(375, 10000) = 125 \)
   - \( x = 375 \times (10000 / 125) = 375 \times 80 = 30000 \) (Correct)

2. For the input `10000 1`:
   - \( n = 10000 \), \( k = 1 \)
   - \( 10^1 = 10 \)
   - \( \text{gcd}(10000, 10) = 10 \)
   - \( x = 10000 \times (10 / 10) = 10000 \) (Correct)

3. For the input `38101 0`:
   - \( n = 38101 \), \( k = 0 \)
   - \( 10^0 = 1 \)
   - \( \text{gcd}(38101, 1) = 1 \)
   - \( x = 38101 \times (1 / 1) = 38101 \) (Correct)

4. For the input `123456789 8`:
   - \( n = 123456789 \), \( k = 8 \)
   - \( 10^8 = 100000000 \)
   - \( \text{gcd}(123456789, 100000000) = 1 \)
   - \( x = 123456789 \times (100000000 / 1) = 12345678900000000 \) (Correct)

### Conclusion

Since the program correctly calculates the \( k \)-rounding for all provided examples and adheres to the problem description, and given that the annotations do not highlight any unhandled edge cases that fall outside the problem constraints, we conclude that the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True** 

The program handles all specified cases correctly and adheres to the constraints of the problem description.
