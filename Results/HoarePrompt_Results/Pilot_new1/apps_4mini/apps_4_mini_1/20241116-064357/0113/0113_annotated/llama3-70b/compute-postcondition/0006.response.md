The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 2, the new value of `n` will be within the range of 4 to 10^9 + 3. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 2, and after incrementing, `n` is now a positive integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 3**
