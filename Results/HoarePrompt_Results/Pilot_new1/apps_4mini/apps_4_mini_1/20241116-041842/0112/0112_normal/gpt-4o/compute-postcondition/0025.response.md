According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If `digits` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is True, indicating that there exists an index `i` that meets the conditions, and `digits` currently has at least one digit processed. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that there is another digit in the `digits` list that has not been processed yet. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `digit` is now the next digit in the list, and we need to update the index accordingly.

Assuming the previous loop iteration processed the first digit, we need to ensure that the next digit is available. If `digits` had at least 2 digits, the next digit would be the second one.

State: **`found` is True, `digits` is a list of at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second digit in the list**
