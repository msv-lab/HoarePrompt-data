The variable `cubes` is assigned a list that is created by a list comprehension, which iterates `n` times (where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and takes input for each iteration. The input is split into integers and mapped to a list. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on the input provided during each of the `n` iterations. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on input**
