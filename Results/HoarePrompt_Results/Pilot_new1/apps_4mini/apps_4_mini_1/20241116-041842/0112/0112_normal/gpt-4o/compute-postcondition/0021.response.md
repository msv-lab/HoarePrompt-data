Output State: **If there exists an index `i` such that `0 â‰¤ i < n`, `used_cubes[i]` is False, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop exits. If no such index exists after checking all indices up to `n`, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` retains its initial value of False. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, or if `digits` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `used_cubes` will remain a list of False values and `found` will remain False.**
