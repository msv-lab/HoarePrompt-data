According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will continue as long as there are more lists in `cubes` to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 3 lists, and `cube` is the third list in `cubes`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more list in `cubes` after the third list. This means that `cubes` must have at least 4 lists, and `cube` should be updated to the fourth list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 4 lists; `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of integers from `cube`.**
