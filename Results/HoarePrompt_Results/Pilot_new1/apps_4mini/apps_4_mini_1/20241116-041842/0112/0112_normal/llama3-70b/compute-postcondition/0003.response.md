According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list (i.e., it should not be empty). Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, we can infer that `cubes` is expected to have a length corresponding to `n`. If `n` is at least 1, then `cubes` must have at least one element (a list). 

Since `digits` is an empty set, it does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `cubes` list must contain at least one list, and `cube` will be the first list in `cubes` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
