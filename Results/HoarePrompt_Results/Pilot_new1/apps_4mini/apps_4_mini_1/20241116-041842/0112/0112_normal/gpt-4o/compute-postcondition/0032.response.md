The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cube_faces` is a list of 6 integers where each integer is in the range 0 to 9. 

After executing the function body, there are two cases for the return value:
- Case 1: If `n` is between 1 and 3 and `cube_faces` is a non-empty list, the function checks if all digits can be matched to the cubes. If all digits have corresponding cubes, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, or if `cube_faces` is an empty list, the function does not perform the matching and returns `False`.
- Case 2: The function returns `True` if all conditions for matching are met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of integers `cube_faces`, and return `True` if all digits can be matched to the cubes, or `False` if they cannot, while also handling invalid inputs for `n` and `cube_faces`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer between 1 and 3) and `cube_faces` (a list of 6 integers in the range 0 to 9), returning `True` if all digits can be matched to the cubes, or `False` if they cannot or if the input parameters are invalid.**
