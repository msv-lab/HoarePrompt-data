The code updates the `digits` set with string representations of each integer from the `cube` list. Since `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, its values will be converted to strings and added to `digits`. The variable `n` does not affect the execution of this line, and the previous state of `digits` is not specified. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of these string representations to `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 lists; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of integers from `cube`.**
