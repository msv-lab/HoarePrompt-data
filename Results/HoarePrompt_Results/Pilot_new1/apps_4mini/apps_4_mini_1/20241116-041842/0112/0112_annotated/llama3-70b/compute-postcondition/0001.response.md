The variable `cubes` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The number of inner lists created corresponds to the value of `n`, which is an input integer in the range 1 to 3. Therefore, `cubes` will contain 1 to 3 lists of integers based on the input provided. The other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the structure of `cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers based on the input**
