To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in the context of the initial state.

1. The variable `digits` contains string representations of all unique digits found in all lists within `cubes`.
2. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, `digits` is updated accordingly, and '0' is only removed if it was present.
3. The code snippet `max_num = int(''.join(sorted(digits, reverse=True)))` sorts the `digits` in reverse order, joins them to form a single string, and then converts that string to an integer.

Now, let's consider the potential scenarios for `digits`:

- If `digits` is an empty set (which happens if `cubes` is empty), the execution of `int(''.join(sorted(digits, reverse=True)))` would result in an error because we cannot convert an empty string to an integer.
- If `digits` contains digits (e.g., '1', '2', '3', etc.), the maximum number would be determined by sorting and joining those digits.

Since the output state must reflect the situation based on the initial state of `digits`, we proceed with the assumption that `digits` is either a set of digits or empty.

Output State: **`digits` contains string representations of all unique digits, and `max_num` is determined from sorted digits, or `digits` is empty resulting in an error**.
