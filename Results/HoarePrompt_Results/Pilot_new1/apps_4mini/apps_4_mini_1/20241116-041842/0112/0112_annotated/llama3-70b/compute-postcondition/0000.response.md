The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `n` are constrained such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
