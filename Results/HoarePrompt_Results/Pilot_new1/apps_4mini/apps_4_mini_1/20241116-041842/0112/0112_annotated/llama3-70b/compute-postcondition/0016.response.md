The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on an implicit parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Additionally, the function works with a cube represented as a list of 6 integers, where each integer `a_{i}_{j}` satisfies the condition 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided details. Therefore, without additional information regarding what the function returns based on the input constraints and relationships, we cannot determine the exact output.

Functionality: **The function accepts an implicit parameter n (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and operates on a cube represented as a list of 6 integers (where each integer satisfies 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), but the specific return value is not provided.**
