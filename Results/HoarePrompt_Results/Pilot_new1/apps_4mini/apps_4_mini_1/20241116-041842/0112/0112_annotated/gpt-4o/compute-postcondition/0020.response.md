According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop has reached its limit and cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` would need to be increased to allow for an additional iteration, and `i` would need to be set to `n` (the current value). However, since `i` cannot be less than `n`, it indicates that the loop cannot run again with the current values.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than `i` to allow for another iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, and `i` is n**
