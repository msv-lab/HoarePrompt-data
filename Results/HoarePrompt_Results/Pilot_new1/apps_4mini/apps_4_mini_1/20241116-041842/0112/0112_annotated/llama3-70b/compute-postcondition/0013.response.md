Postcondition: ***`digits` contains string representations of all unique digits found in all lists within `cubes`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, `digits` is updated accordingly, and '0' is only removed if it was present.***
