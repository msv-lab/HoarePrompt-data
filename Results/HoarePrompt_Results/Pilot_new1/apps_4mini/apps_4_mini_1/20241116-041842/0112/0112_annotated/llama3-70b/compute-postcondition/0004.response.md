The code updates the `digits` set by adding string representations of each digit in the `cube` list. The value of `cube` is known as the first list in `cubes`, and `digits` starts as an empty set. The previous values of `n`, `cubes`, and `cube` do not affect the outcome of the `digits` update directly.

Since `cube` contains digits (the specific values are not provided), `digits` will now contain the string representations of those digits. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `digits` set.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` contains string representations of the digits in `cube`**
