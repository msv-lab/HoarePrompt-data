The `digits` set is updated with string representations of the elements in the `cube` list. The `cube` list is the second list in `cubes`, and since `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the elements in `cube` can be any integers. The previous state of `digits` is not specified, but it will now include the string representations of the integers from `cube`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new contents of `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 lists; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of the elements in `cube`.**
