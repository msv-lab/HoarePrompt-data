According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lists in `cubes` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 3, which indicates that there are at least 3 lists in `cubes`. Since `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 4 lists, and `cube` must be updated to the fourth list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is 4; `cubes` is a list containing at least 4 lists of integers; `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of integers from `cube`.**
