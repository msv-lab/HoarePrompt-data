According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will iterate over each list in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 1 list of integers, and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 2 lists of integers, and `cube` should then refer to the second list in `cubes`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, we can infer that `n` does not affect the loop's ability to execute again, but we can assume that it might be relevant for other operations outside this loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `cubes` needs to contain at least 2 lists of integers.
- `cube` should be updated to refer to the second list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with string representations of integers from `cube`.**
