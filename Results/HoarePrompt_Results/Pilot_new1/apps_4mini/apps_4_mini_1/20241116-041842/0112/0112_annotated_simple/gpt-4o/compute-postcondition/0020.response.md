According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. 

Since `n` is 3, the next value of `i` will be equal to `n`, which means the loop will not execute again. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can execute again. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, `num` is defined, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, where `used_cubes[i]` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, and `found` is set to True**
