The code updates the `digits` variable with string representations of integers from the `cube` list. The `cube` list contains integers, and the `str(digit)` function converts each integer to a string. The previous state of `digits` is not provided, but it will now include the string representations of all integers in `cube`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with string representations of integers from `cube`.**
