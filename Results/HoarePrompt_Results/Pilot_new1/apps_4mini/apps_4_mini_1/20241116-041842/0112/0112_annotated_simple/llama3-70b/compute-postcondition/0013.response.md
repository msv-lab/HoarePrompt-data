Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing string representations of all integers from all lists in `cubes`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. If `cubes` is empty or contains no lists, `digits` remains an empty set. Additionally, if `n` is between 1 and 3 (inclusive), the loop executes `n` times, potentially populating `digits` with string representations of integers from `cubes`, excluding '0' if it was present.***
