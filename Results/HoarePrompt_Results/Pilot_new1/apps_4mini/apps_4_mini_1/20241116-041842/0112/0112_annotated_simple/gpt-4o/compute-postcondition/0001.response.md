The code initializes `used_cubes` as a list of boolean values. The length of `used_cubes` is determined by the value of `n`, which can be 1, 2, or 3. Each element in the list is set to `False`, indicating that none of the cubes are used initially. The previous values of `n` and `cube_faces` are not affected, and `num` remains undefined. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `used_cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9; `num` is undefined; `used_cubes` is a list of length n with all values set to False.**
