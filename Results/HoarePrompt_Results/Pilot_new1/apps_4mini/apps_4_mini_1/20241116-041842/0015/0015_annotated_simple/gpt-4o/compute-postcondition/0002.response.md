The code prints 'YES', which does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The initial condition states that `b` is equal to `a`, but there are no further calculations or assignments. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement has been executed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `b` is equal to `a`, and 'YES' is printed.**
