The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the condition implies that the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the resulting quotient is non-negative. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `c` is not equal to 0; the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`; the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; printed output is 'YES'**
