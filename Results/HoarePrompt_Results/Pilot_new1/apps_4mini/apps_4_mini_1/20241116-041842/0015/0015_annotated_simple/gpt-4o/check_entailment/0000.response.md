To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it adheres to the problem description, which states that we need to check if the integer `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`.

### Program Logic Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. **Checking if `b` equals `a`**: If `b` is equal to `a`, the program correctly prints "YES" because `b` is the first element of the sequence.
3. **Checking if `c` is zero**: If `c` is zero and `b` is not equal to `a`, the program correctly prints "NO" because the sequence does not change and cannot reach any number other than `a`.
4. **General Case**: When `c` is not zero, it checks:
   - If `(b - a) % c == 0`: This checks if `b` can be reached by adding `c` repeatedly starting from `a`.
   - If `(b - a) / c >= 0`: This ensures that we are moving in the correct direction (i.e., `b` is reachable in a positive number of steps).

### Edge Cases
1. **When `c` is positive**: The sequence will only increase. If `b < a`, the program will correctly output "NO".
2. **When `c` is negative**: The sequence will only decrease. If `b > a`, the program will correctly output "NO".
3. **When `c` is zero**: The only possible value for `b` that will yield "YES" is when `b` equals `a`.

### Testing with Example Cases
- **Input**: `1 7 3` → Output: "YES" (Correct)
- **Input**: `10 10 0` → Output: "YES" (Correct)
- **Input**: `1 -4 5` → Output: "NO" (Correct)
- **Input**: `0 60 50` → Output: "NO" (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program handles all described scenarios properly, including edge cases. Each condition is checked logically, and the outputs match the expected results according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
