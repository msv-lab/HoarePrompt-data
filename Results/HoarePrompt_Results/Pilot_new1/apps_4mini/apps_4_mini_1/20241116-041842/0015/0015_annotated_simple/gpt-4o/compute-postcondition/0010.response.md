The code prints the string 'NO'. Since the print statement does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`, the output state reflects the current values of these variables along with the printed output. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values, `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and either `(b - a) % c != 0` or `(b - a) / c < 0`, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values, `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and either `(b - a) % c != 0` or `(b - a) / c < 0`, and the output is 'NO'**
