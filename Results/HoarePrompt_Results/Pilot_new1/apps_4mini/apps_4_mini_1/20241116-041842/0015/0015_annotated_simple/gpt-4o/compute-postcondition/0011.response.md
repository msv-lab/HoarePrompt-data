Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the quotient `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO', which occurs if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or if the quotient `(b - a) / c` is negative.***
