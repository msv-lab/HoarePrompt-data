Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case when `c` is negative properly. 

For example, consider the input:
```
a = 5, b = 2, c = -1
```
In this case, the sequence generated would be `5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ...`, and `b = 2` does appear in the sequence. However, the program would output "NO" because it checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which would be false since `c` is negative and `(2 - 5) / -1 = 3`, which is positive, but the program incorrectly concludes that it does not appear in the sequence.

Thus, there are cases where the program fails to determine correctly whether `b` appears in the sequence when `c` is negative.
