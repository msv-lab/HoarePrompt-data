The code prints 'YES', and it does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The initial state indicates that `b` is equal to `a`, but no specific values are provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that 'YES' is printed, and the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers; `b` is equal to `a`; 'YES' is printed**
