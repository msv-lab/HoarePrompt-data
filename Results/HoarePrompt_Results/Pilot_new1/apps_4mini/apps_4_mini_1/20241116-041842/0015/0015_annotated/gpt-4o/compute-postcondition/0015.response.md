Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input values. It prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it prints 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. **
