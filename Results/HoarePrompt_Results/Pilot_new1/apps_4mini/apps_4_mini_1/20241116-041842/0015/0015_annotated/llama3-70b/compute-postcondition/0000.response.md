The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input split into three integers. Since the specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, their values remain unspecified but are still integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now three integers obtained from user input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input**
