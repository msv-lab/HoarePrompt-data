Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, and the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and non-negative, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `(b - a)` is either not divisible by `c` or negative, 'NO' is printed.***
