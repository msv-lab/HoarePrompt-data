Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input three integers. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the input quantities of three different fruits. Specifically, it determines the maximum number of lemons as the minimum of the input values: the first input (a), half of the second input (b), and a quarter of the third input (c). It then calculates the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons and prints this total. The function does not return any value. **
