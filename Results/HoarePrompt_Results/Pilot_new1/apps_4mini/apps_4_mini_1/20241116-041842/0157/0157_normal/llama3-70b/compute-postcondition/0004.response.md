To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet. 

The variable `min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The expression `print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)` calculates the value based on `min_lemon`.

Let's break down the calculation:
1. `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which equals `min_lemon * 7`.

Now, since `min_lemon` is dependent on the input integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, we denote the output state as follows, considering the calculation does not alter any of the input integers:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the printed output is `min_lemon * 7`**.
