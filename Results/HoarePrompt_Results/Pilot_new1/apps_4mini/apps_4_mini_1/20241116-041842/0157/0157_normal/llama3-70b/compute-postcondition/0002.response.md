The value of `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this assignment, and `c` is now an integer based on the user's input. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `a` and `b` remain unchanged, while `c` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
