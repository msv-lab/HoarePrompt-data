Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input.
2. It calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - The number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`), which ensures there are enough apples for the lemons used.
   - The number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`), which ensures there are enough pears for the lemons used.
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used based on the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`), using the formula: `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are not enough pears or apples to make even one complete set of the compote. For example, if `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, it correctly identifies that no compote can be made because there are not enough pears, returning `0`.

Thus, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
