Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the provided ratio of lemons, apples, and pears. It uses the formula `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` to determine the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which ensures that there are enough apples and pears to match the required ratio. 

The output is then calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which correctly sums the total number of fruits used. 

The program handles the edge cases, including when there are insufficient fruits to meet the ratio requirements, as demonstrated in the third example where the output is correctly 0. Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
