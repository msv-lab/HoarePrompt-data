Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers from user input representing quantities of lemons, apples, and pears. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients that can be made, where each set requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. It then outputs the total number of fruits used in these sets, which is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
