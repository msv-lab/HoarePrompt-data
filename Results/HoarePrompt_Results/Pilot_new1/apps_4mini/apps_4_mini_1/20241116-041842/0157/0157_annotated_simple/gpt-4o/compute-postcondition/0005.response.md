To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an input positive integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is a new input integer
- `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`
- `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`

The code snippet provided is:
```
print(total_fruits)
```

Now, we will evaluate the impact of this code:

1. The variable `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.
2. The `print` statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`, but does not change its value or the values of any other variables.

Since `total_fruits` is derived from the previously defined variables, we note that the output will reflect the value of `total_fruits` based on the value of `max_lemons`.

Thus, the output state will summarize the values of the variables and indicate that `total_fruits` has been printed.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a new input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`, and the value of `total_fruits` has been printed.**
