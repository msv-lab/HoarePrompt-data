To calculate the output state, we first need to determine the value of `min_lemon`. The variable `min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

Once we have `min_lemon`, we can calculate the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7`.

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, we will denote `min_lemon` as its calculated value based on those inputs.

Thus, the output state will include the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the result of the print statement, which is `min_lemon * 7`. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the result is `min_lemon * 7`.**
