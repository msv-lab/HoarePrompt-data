The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. All three parameters are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. After executing the function body, it returns a value based on the relationship between these parameters. However, the specific output or return value based on the parameters is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three positive integers representing quantities of lemons, apples, and pears.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.**
