The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as seen in the function definition. However, it operates on three positive integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). These integers must satisfy the constraints of being between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without further details on the output, we cannot determine the exact functionality related to the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, each ranging from 1 to 1000, but the return value is not specified.**
