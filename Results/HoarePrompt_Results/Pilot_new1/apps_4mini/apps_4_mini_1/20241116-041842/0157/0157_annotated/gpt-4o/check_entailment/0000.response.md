To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). The fruits must be used in a specific ratio to make a compote:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to prepare the compote. If it is not possible to use any fruits, the output should be 0.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code takes three integers as input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: 
   - `max_lemons` is calculated using `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This correctly determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available apples and pears.
3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: 
   - The total number of fruits used is calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7` (since 1 + 2 + 4 = 7).
4. **Output**: The total number of fruits is printed.

### Edge Cases:
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` are not sufficient to make even one set of the required fruits (i.e., if `a < 1`, `b < 2`, or `c < 4`), `max_lemons` will be 0, and the output will correctly be 0.
- The program handles all specified constraints (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000).

### Comparison with Annotations:
The annotations summarize that the function calculates the maximum number of lemons and prints the total number of fruits based on that. They also mention edge cases like not having enough pears to cook any compote, which aligns with the program's logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It accurately calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used based on the given ratios and handles edge cases effectively. 

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
