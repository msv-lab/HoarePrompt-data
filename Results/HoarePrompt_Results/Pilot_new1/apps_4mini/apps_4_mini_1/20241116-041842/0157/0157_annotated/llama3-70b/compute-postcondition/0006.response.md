Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs representing quantities of lemons, apples, and pears. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients that can be formed, where each set requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The function then outputs the total number of items used in these complete sets, which is calculated as the minimum number multiplied by 7 (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears). Note that the function does not handle cases where the inputs are not integers or where the input values are outside the specified range of 1 to 1000. **
