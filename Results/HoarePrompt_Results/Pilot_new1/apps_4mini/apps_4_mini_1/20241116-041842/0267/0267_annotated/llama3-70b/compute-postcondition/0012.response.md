According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is 2. Since `i` is currently 1, which is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted as the values of `l`, `r`, `n`, and `dp[n, k]` do not change and are not impacted by the loop iteration.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 90, and `i` is 2**
