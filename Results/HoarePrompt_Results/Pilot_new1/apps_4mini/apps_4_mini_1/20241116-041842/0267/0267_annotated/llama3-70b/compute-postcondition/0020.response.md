Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is calculated based on the specified formula, where `dp[n, 1]` is set to 9, `dp[n, 2]` is calculated as `90 + 9 * (n // 10 - 1)`, and `dp[n, 3]` is computed as `-720 + 90 * (n // 100 - 1)`, with the final result for `dp[n, k]` being taken modulo `MOD`. The function does not return any value and the state of the program remains unchanged in cases where `k` is 0 or when the tuple `(n, k)` exists in the `dp` structure.***
