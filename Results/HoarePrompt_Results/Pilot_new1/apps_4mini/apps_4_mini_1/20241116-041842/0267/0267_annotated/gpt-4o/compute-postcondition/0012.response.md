Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, or if `l` and `r` are such that there are no integers in the range that satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, then `total_sum` remains 0. If `l` equals `r` and `func_1(l, k)` returns false, then `total_sum` is 0.**
