According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from `1` to `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value it took, which is `k - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `k` and the loop must be able to run for `i` values less than `k`.

Since `i` is currently `k - 1`, it needs to be adjusted to `k`, and we also need to ensure that `k` is greater than `1` for the loop to have executed at least once. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 + 9 * (10^{(k - 1)} - 1) + 9 * 10 * (10, k is greater than 1, i is k`**
