The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` defining a range, and an integer `k`. It calculates the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, returning this sum modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, or if `l` and `r` are not within the bounds 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, the function returns 0.
