To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the functions and their output hints in detail.

### Problem Description
The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The result must be printed modulo `998244353`.

### Functions Overview
1. **Function 1**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n, k):
       return len(set(str(n))) <= k
   ```
   - This function checks if the number of distinct digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It correctly handles the requirement of counting distinct digits, but it does not handle negative numbers or cases where `k` is less than 0, which is not a concern given the problem constraints (since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1).

2. **Function 2**:
   ```python
   def func_2(l, r, k):
       total_sum = 0
       for num in range(l, r + 1):
           if func_1(num, k):
               total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
       return total_sum
   ```
   - This function iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, checking each number to see if it meets the criteria defined in `func_1`. If it does, it adds the number to `total_sum`, taking care to apply the modulo operation.
   - The function assumes that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and it is stated that if `l` is greater than `r`, it returns 0. However, the problem description specifies that `l <= r`, so this is not a concern.

### Output Hints Analysis
- **Output Hint for Function 1**: The hint correctly describes the functionality of `func_1`.
- **Output Hint for Function 2**: The hint states that the function calculates the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, returning this sum modulo `MOD`. It also mentions returning 0 if `l > r`, which is not applicable here due to constraints.

### Edge Case Consideration
1. **Large Values of `l` and `r`**: The range can be very large (up to `10^18`), which makes iterating through every number inefficient and potentially infeasible. The program as written will attempt to iterate through potentially billions of numbers, which could lead to performance issues.
2. **Distinct Digits**: The function does not handle cases where `k` is 0 or negative, but since the constraints ensure `k >= 1`, this isn't an issue here.

### Conclusion
While the program correctly implements the logic for counting distinct digits and summing the valid numbers, the approach of iterating through the range from `l` to `r` is not feasible for large values of `r` (close to `10^18`). The program will fail to complete or will take an impractically long time to execute for large ranges.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly with regards to performance and handling large input ranges.

Correctness: **False**.
