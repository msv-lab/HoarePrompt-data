According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given the constraints (1 <= l <= r < 10^18), `l` should be less than or equal to `r` to ensure that the range is valid and the loop can run. 

At the start of the loop, `num` will take the value of `l` in the first iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is initialized correctly based on `l`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
