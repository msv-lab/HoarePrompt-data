The code assigns the value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD` to `total_sum`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0. The value of `num` is equal to `l + 2`. Therefore, the calculation becomes `(0 + (l + 2)) % MOD`. Since `MOD` is not specified, we can denote it as `MOD` in the output.

Thus, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(l + 2) % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; `total_sum` is `(l + 2) % MOD; `num` is `l + 2`**
