The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. Given that `i` is 2, we can calculate the expression as follows:

1. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`: This is `10 ** (2 - 1)` which equals `10 ** 1 = 10`.
2. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`: This is `10 ** (k - 2)`.
3. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)` again, which is still `10`.
4. Now, substitute these values into the expression: 
   - `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`

The value of `dp[n, k]` will be updated based on the above calculations. The other variables (`l`, `r`, `k`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is at least 2, `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated, and `i` is 2**
