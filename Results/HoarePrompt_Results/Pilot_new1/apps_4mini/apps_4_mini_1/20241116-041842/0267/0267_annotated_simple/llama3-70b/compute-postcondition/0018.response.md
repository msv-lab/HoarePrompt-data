Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated based on the value of `k`: if `k` is less than 2, `dp[n, k]` remains 9; if `k` is exactly 2, `dp[n, k]` becomes 90; if `k` is greater than 2, `dp[n, k]` is updated according to the formula for `k - 1` iterations. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`.**
