According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `num` starting from `l` up to `r`. The loop variable `num` is initialized to `l` at the start of the first iteration and increments by 1 in each subsequent iteration until it exceeds `r`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `r`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to `r + 1`, which will exceed the upper limit of the loop. Therefore, `l` and `r` do not need to change; however, `num` must be adjusted to `r + 1`.

State: **`l`, `r`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0 initially, and `num` is equal to `r + 1**
