The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000 inclusive; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is increased by 1.
