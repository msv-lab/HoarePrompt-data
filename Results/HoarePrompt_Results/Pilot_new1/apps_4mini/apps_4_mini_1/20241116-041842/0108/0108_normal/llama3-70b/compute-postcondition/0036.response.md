According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `alphabet`. For the loop to execute again, `char` must be the next character in the `alphabet` that has not yet been processed. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the next character after the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, which means that the loop can continue if there are still characters in the `alphabet` to process.

Since `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last occurrence of `char`, we need to adjust `char` to the next character in the alphabet. Additionally, we need to ensure that `s` contains at least one occurrence of this new `char` for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `char` should be updated to the next character in the alphabet.
- `s` must contain at least one occurrence of this new `char`.

State: **`if char is in s then res` contains all occurrences of `char` followed by the number of times `char` was found in `s`, `char` is the next character in the alphabet, and `s` contains at least one occurrence of this new `char`.**
