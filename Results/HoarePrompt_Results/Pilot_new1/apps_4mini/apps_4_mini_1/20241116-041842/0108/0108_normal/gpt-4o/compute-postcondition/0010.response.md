Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000 inclusive; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is increased by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. This means that if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, the function progresses to the next character in the target sequence, while all other variables remain unaffected.***
