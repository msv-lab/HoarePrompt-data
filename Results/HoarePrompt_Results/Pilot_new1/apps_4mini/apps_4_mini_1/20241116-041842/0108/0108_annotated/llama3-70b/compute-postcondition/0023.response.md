According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the variable `char` is still present in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is still in `s`, which means the loop can execute one more time without any further adjustments needed. 

State: **`s` has had its first occurrence of `char` replaced with the character following it in ASCII; `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s` plus 'z' plus `char`; `char` is still in `s`.**
