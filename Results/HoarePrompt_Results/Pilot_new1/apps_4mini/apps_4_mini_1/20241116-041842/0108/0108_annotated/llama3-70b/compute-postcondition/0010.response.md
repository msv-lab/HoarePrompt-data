The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. The previous value of `res` is 'ab', and the value of `char` is 'b'. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 'ab' + 'b' which is 'abb'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is modified to contain 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
