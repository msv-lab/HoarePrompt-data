The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. Since `res` already contains all occurrences of 'a' plus `char`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet, the new value of `res` will include one additional occurrence of `char`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' plus `char` (updated), `s` still contains at least one occurrence of `char`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet.

Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of 'a' plus `char` (updated), `s` still contains at least one occurrence of `char`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet**
