Output State: **`if char is 'z' then res` contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s`, `s` has had its first occurrence of 'z' replaced with '{', and the loop will not execute again as 'z' will no longer be in `s`. If `char` is any character from 'a' to 'y', then `res` will contain all occurrences of 'a' to `char`, `s` will have its first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next ASCII character, and the loop will continue until `char` is no longer found in `s`. If `s` does not contain 'a' to 'z' initially (which contradicts the initial state), the loop will not execute and `res` will remain unchanged.**
