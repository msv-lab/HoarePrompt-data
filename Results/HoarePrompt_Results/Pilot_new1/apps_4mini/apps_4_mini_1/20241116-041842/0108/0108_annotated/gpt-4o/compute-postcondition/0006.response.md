Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, and `j` is either 0 or 1. If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `target` (which is 'a'), then `j` is incremented to 1. If the first character of `s` is not 'a', `j` remains 0.***
