Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it contains all the lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. If `s` contains all characters in the correct order, it prints the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `s` is shorter than 26 characters or does not contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, it prints -1. The function does not return any value, it only prints the result. Edge cases include handling empty strings or strings that do not contain the required characters.**
