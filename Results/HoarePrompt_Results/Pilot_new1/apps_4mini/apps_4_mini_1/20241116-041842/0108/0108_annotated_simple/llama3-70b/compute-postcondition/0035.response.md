Output State: **`if char is in s then res` is the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s` plus the number of occurrences of `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet`. If `char` is not in `s`, the loop does not execute and `res` remains unchanged. If `s` initially does not contain `char`, `res` remains empty and `s` remains unchanged.**
