The code appends `char` to `res`. Since `res` is a concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s`, the value of `res` will now include one more occurrence of `char`. The other variables (`s` and `char`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s` plus one additional `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`.

Output State: **`res` is the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s` plus one additional `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`**
