The code appends `char` to `res`, which means that the value of `res` will now include one more occurrence of `char`. The previous state of `res` is the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s` plus one additional `char`. The state of `s` remains unchanged, as it still contains `char` and has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is now the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s` plus two additional `char`, and `s` still contains `char`.

Output State: **`res` is the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s` plus two additional `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII, and `s` still contains `char`**
