The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, and `j` remains either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the previous comparisons. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `i` is increased by 1; `j` is either 0, 1, or 2.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `i` is increased by 1; `j` is either 0, 1, or 2**
