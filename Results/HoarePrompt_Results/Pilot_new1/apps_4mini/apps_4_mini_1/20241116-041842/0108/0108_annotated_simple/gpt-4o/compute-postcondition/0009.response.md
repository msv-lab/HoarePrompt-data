The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is either 0 or 1 and is less than `target_len`, the possible values of `j` after the increment will be 1 or 2. The length of `s` is greater than 1, but it does not affect the state of `j`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `j` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `j` is either 1 or 2**
