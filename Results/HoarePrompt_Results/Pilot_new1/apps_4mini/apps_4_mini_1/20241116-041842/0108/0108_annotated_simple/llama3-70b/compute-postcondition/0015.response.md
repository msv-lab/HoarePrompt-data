The value of `res` is incremented by the value of `char`. Since `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, `res` will now contain its previous value plus this new character. The previous state of `res` is unknown, but it is affected by the addition of `char`. Therefore, the output state is: `alphabet` has at least one more character, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, and `res` is updated to include `char`.

Output State: **`alphabet` has at least one more character, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, and `res` is updated to include `char`**
