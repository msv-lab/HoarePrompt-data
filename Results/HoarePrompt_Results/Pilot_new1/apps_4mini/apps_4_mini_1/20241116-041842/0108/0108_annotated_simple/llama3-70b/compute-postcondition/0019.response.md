The code snippet modifies the string `s` by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the ASCII sequence. The value of `char` is present in `s`, and since `alphabet` has at least one more character, the replacement will be valid. The variable `res` is increased by `char`, but this does not affect the operation of the replacement itself.

After executing the code:
- `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character (i.e., `char` + 1 in ASCII).
- The state of `res` is not explicitly changed by this line, but it has been previously increased by `char`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `s` and the unchanged state of `res`.

Output State: **`alphabet` has at least one more character, `char` is in `s`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character, and `res` is increased by `char`.**
