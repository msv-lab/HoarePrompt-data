The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The values of `j` and `s` remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters based on user input; `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `s`; `i` is now 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters based on user input; `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `s`; `i` is now 1**
