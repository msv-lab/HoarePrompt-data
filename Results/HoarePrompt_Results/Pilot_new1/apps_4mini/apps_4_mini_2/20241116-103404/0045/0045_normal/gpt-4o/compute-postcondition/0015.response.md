Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements with the last element incremented by 1, and `i` is `k - 2`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the loop has reached a condition where further iterations are not required. If `remainder` is not 0, the program continues executing the subsequent code in the loop.***
