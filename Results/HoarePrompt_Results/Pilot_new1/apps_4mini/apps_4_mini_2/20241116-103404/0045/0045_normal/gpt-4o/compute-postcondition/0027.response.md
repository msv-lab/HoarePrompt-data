Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` consecutive integers starting from 1. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, the function returns -1. If the minimum sum is valid, it calculates how many times this sum can fit into `n` and generates a sequence of `k` integers where the first `k` integers are multiplied by this factor. If there is any remainder after this division, the function increments the last elements of the sequence accordingly. The final output is the modified sequence of integers. **
