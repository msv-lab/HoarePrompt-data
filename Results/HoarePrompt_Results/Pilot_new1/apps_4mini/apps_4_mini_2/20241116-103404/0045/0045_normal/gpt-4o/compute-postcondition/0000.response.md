The value of `min_sum` is assigned the result of the expression `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range specified, but the specific value of `k` is not provided. Therefore, `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. The output state reflects that `min_sum` is determined by the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2**
