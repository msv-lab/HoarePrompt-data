Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is the element at index `k - 2` in the list. If `remainder` equals 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `remainder` is not 0, the program continues executing without breaking.***
