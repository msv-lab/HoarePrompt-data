The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with constraints that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if the minimum sum, calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum sum required exceeds `n`. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, allowing for further processing in the program.

In Case 2, the function returns a modified sequence based on specified conditions, which will either be the last `k` elements incremented or remain as the sequence [d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k] if the remainder is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and it returns -1 if the minimum sum required exceeds `n`. If the minimum sum is valid, it does not return a value, allowing for further processing, and under certain conditions, it returns a modified sequence. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, returns -1 if the minimum sum required exceeds `n`. If the minimum sum is valid, it does not return a value, and under certain conditions, it returns a modified sequence.**
