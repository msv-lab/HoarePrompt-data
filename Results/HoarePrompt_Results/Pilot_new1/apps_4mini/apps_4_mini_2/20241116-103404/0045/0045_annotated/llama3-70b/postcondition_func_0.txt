The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two integers. If `b` is initially 0, the function will return `a` without performing any calculations. The function does not enforce that `a` and `b` are positive integers, so it can also handle zero or negative values, returning the absolute value of the GCD when applicable.
