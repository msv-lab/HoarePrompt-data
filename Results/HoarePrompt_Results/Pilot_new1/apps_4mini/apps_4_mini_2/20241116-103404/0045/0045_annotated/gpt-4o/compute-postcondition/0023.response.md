According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to the range defined by `k`. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 3`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `k - 4`. However, since the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, we need to ensure that `k - 4` is still within the valid range. This means `k` must be at least `4` (i.e., `k >= 4`). 

Additionally, since `sequence[i]` is updated at index `k - 2`, and `i` is `k - 3`, the next iteration will access `sequence[k - 3]`, which is valid as long as `k - 3` is non-negative.

To summarize, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` should be at least `4` for the loop to execute again.
- `i` should be `k - 4` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers with `k` greater than or equal to 4, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -3, `sequence` is updated at index `k - 2`, `i` is equal to `k - 4`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.**
