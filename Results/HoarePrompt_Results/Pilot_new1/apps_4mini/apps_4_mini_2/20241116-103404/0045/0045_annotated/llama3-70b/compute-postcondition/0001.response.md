According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue executing as long as `b` is non-zero (i.e., `b` is truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` has been assigned the value of `a % b`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero after the assignment. Since `a` is assigned the value of `b` in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `a` is a positive integer greater than `b` to guarantee that `b` will not become zero after the modulus operation.

Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers and do not affect the condition of the loop directly, the critical adjustment is to ensure that `a` is greater than `b` after the assignment. Therefore, we need to modify the state to reflect that:

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10; `a` is greater than `b`**
