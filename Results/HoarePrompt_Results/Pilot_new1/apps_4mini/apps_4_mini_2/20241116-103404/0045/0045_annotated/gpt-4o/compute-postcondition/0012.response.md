The code decreases the value of `remainder` by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is 0, so after executing the statement, `remainder` will be -1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, and `i` is equal to `k - 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, `i` is equal to `k - 1`**
