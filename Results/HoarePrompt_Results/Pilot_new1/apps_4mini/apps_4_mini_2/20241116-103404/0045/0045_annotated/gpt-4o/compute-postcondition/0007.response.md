According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, which means `i` will take values starting from `k - 1` and decrementing until it reaches `0`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least `1` because if `k` is `0`, the range would be empty and the loop would not execute.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, we can confirm that `k` is at least `1`. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to `k - 1`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `k` is at least `1` (which it is, since `k` is a positive integer),
- `i` is initialized to `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, `i` is `k - 1`**
