To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its annotations in relation to the requirements of creating a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum equals n, with the maximum greatest common divisor.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:
1. **Input**: Two integers, n and k, representing the sum and the number of terms in the sequence, respectively.
2. **Output**: A sequence of k positive integers that sum to n and have the maximum possible GCD, or -1 if no such sequence exists.
3. **Constraints**: Both n and k are positive integers.

### Annotations of the Code:
The provided code defines a function that computes the GCD of two integers. The annotations clarify that:
- The function can handle zero or negative values, returning the absolute value of the GCD when applicable.
- The function does not enforce that `a` and `b` are positive integers.

### Issues Identified:
1. The problem requires a sequence of k positive integers that sum to n. However, the provided code only computes the GCD of n and k, which doesn't construct the required sequence or check if such a sequence can exist.
2. The code does not handle the case where k is greater than n, which would make it impossible to create a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers (e.g., if n = 5 and k = 6, the output should be -1).
3. The GCD calculation does not contribute to generating the required sequence or ensuring that the sequence has a maximal GCD.

### Example Cases:
- For the input `5 3`, the output should be `-1` since it is impossible to create a strictly increasing sequence of three positive integers that sum to 5.
- For the input `6 3`, a valid output is `1 2 3`, which sums to 6 and has a GCD of 1.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to create the sequence of k positive integers or to determine when such a sequence is impossible. The GCD calculation is irrelevant to generating the required output based on the problem description.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
