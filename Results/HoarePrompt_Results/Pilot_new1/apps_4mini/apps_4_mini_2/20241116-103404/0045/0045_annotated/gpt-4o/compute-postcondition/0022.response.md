The code decrements the variable `remainder` by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is -2, so after execution, `remainder` becomes -3. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -3, `sequence` is updated at index `k - 2`, `i` is equal to `k - 3`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -3, `sequence` is updated at index `k - 2`, `i` is equal to `k - 3`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.**
