According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is now `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero. 

Since `b` is derived from `a % b`, if `b` was zero at the end of the last iteration, it would indicate that `a` is a multiple of the previous value of `b`, and hence `b` would not be able to take a non-zero value in the next iteration.

To ensure the loop executes again, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `b` must be non-zero. Since `b` is now `a % b`, we need to ensure that `a` is not a multiple of the previous value of `b`.

State: **`a` is now the previous value of `b`, `b` is now non-zero**
