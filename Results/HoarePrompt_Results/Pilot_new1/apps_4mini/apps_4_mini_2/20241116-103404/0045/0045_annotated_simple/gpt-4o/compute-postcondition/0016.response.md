The value of `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, where `i` is `k - 2`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `sequence[i]`, but the operation modifies that particular element in the sequence. The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `sequence[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 (where `i` is `k - 2`)**
