The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of the expression `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This expression calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` are both positive integers, and while the exact value of `k` is not specified, we know it is within the range of 1 to 10^10. Therefore, `min_sum` will also be a positive integer. The output state reflects the assignment and the calculated value of `min_sum` based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`**
