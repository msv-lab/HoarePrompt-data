The code assigns the value of `n - d * min_sum` to the variable `remainder`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`, we can determine the value of `remainder`. 

The value of `remainder` will be the difference between `n` and the product of `d` and `min_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`**
