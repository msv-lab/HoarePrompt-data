The value of `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from the list `b`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `b` contains input integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers based on input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.**
