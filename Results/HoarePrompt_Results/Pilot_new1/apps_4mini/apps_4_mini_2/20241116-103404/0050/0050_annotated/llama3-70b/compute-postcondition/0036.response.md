Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `r` unchanged.***
