Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, computes `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and then calculates `total_bourles` as the sum of `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` and `remaining_bourles`, and prints `total_bourles`. This ensures that all scenarios where buying and selling prices are compared are covered, including cases where the lists `s` and `b` are empty, leading to potential issues with `min_buy_price` and `max_sell_price` being undefined.***
