The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown since they are taken from user input. The other variables `s` and `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers, while `s` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers**
