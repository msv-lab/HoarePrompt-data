The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The input will be a list of integers, and since `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` will hold the same integers converted to integers (if they were not already). The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the new variable `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, and `b` is a list of integers from input.**
