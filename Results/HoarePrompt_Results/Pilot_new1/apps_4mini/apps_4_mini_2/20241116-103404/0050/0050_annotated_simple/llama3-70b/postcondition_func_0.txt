The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with two lists `s` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It calculates the total number of complete shares that can be obtained from `r` using the values in the sorted list `s`. Afterward, it updates `r` based on the total shares and the values in the sorted list `b`. Finally, it prints the updated value of `r`. If `n` or `m` is less than or equal to 0, or if `r` is less than the smallest value in `s`, the function may not perform any calculations, leaving `r` unchanged.
