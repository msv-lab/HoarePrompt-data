The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into parts. The input function accepts a line of integers, which are then converted to integers and stored in the list `s`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` are not affected by this operation, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `s` is now a list of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers within the ranges 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of n positive integers; `b` is a list of m positive integers**
