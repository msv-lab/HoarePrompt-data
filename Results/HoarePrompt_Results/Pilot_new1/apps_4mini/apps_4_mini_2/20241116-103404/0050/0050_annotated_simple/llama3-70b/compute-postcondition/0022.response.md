Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is `k + 1`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `shares` unchanged and `r` as it was before the check.***
