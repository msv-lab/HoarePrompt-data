The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from the list `b`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `min_buy_price` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and the newly calculated `max_sell_price`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from the input; `s` is a list of integers from the input; `b` is a list of integers from the input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`.**
