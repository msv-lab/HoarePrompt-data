Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element in `s`, `m` is greater than 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty list, and `i` is 2. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
