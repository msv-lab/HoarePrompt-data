Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is updated to `r % s[0]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, and `shares` is increased by `r // s[0]`. If `r` is less than `s[0]`, the loop or if statement is exited without modifying `shares` or `r`, leaving `shares` as 0 and `i` as 0.***
