Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from the input; `s` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and then computes `total_bourles` as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, which is then printed. This covers the scenarios where either the selling price is not advantageous compared to the buying price or where a profitable transaction is possible.***
