The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. This means that `b` will contain integers that are inputted as a space-separated string. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `b` is now a list of integers from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of integers from the input, and `b` is a list of integers from the input.**
