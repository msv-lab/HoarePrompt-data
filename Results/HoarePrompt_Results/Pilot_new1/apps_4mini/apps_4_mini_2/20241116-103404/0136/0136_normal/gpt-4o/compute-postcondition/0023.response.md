Postcondition: ***`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros and remains unchanged if it was not empty; `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and if `b` was initially empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, the output is '>'; otherwise, if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. This covers all cases including when `b` is initially empty, ensuring that the outputs are based on the lexicographical comparison of the two strings.***
