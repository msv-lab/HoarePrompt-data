The `data` variable is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which means it will contain a list of strings obtained from the input. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly modified by this operation, but they will be part of the input provided. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, the output state will reflect that `data` is a list of strings derived from the input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input**.
