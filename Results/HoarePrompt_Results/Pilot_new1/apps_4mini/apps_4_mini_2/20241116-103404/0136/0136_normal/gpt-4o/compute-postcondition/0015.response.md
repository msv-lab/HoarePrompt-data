Postcondition: ***`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros and remaining unchanged if it was not empty; `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and if `b` was initially empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is lexicographically less than `b`.***
