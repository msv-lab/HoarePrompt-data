Postcondition: ***`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed and `b` is the input string without leading zeroes. The strings `a` and `b` are not equal; if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the function prints '<'. Otherwise, the function prints '>', indicating that `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`.***
