Postcondition: ***`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, and `b` is the input string without leading zeroes. If `a` is equal to `b`, the function prints '='. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the function prints '<'. Otherwise, the function prints '>', indicating that `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`.***
