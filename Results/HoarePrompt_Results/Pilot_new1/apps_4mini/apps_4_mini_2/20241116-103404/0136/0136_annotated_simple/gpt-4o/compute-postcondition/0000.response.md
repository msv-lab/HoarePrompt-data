The `data` variable is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which takes input from the user and splits it into a list based on whitespace. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b`, along with the new variable `data` which will contain the split input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, `data` is a list of input strings split by whitespace**
