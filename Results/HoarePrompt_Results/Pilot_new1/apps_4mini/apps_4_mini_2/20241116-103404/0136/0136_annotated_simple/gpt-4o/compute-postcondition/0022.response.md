Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `a` is either '0' or retains its original value, `len(a)` is equal to `len(b)`, and `data` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. The conditions ensure that both `a` and `b` have the same length, which prevents any edge cases related to leading zeros or negative values since `b` cannot have leading zeros and `a` is either '0' or equal to `b`.***
