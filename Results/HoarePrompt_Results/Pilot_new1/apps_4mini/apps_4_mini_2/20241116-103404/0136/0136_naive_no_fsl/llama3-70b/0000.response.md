Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where both input integers are zero correctly. Specifically, if both `a` and `b` are "0" (with or without leading zeroes), the program will strip the leading zeroes and compare the empty string, which will lead to an incorrect output.

For example, with the input:
```
0
0
```
The output should be `=` since both numbers are equal. However, after stripping leading zeroes, both `a` and `b` become empty strings, and the comparison `a == b` will evaluate to `True`, resulting in the correct output of `=`. 

However, the program does not explicitly handle the case of leading zeroes correctly in the context of very large integers, as it assumes all cases will reduce to a valid number without checking if both are actually zero.

Thus, the program can fail in edge cases where both inputs are zero or where leading zeroes may affect the comparison in cases not explicitly handled by the logic given. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
