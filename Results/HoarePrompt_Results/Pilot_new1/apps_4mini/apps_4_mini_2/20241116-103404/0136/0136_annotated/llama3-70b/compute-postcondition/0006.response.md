The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '<'. The variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the original conditions of `a` and `b` along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes; `b` is the input string after leading zeroes have been removed; the string `a` is not equal to the string `b`; and the string `a` is lexicographically less than the string `b`, and the output is '<'**.
