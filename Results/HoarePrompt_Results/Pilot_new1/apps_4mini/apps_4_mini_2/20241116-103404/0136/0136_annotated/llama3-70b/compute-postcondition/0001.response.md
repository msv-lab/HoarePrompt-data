The code assigns `b` the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means it accepts an input string and removes any leading zeroes from it. The variable `a` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation. The output state will reflect the new value of `b` after leading zeroes are stripped, while `a` retains its original value.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes; `b` is the input string after leading zeroes have been removed.**
