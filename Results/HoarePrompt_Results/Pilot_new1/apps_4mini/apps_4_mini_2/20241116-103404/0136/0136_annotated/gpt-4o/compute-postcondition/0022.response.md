Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the function prints '>'; otherwise, it prints '='. If `b` is originally an empty string, it is considered as '0', and if `a` was originally empty, it is set to '0'. The function handles all cases where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers without leading zeros, ensuring the correct output based on their comparative values.***
