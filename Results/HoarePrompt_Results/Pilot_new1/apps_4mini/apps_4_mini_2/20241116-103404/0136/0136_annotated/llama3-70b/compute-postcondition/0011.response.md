The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes, and each can contain no more than 10^6 digits. The function returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings. It processes these strings and returns a result based on their values.**
