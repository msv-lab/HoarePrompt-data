The function accepts two non-negative integers as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first integer is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either integer is empty, it is treated as '0'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result.
