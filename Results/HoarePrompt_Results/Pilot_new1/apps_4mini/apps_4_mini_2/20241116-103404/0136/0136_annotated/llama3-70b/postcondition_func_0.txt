The function accepts two non-negative integers as strings from user input, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the numbers are equal, '<' if the first number is less than the second, and '>' if the first number is greater than the second. There is no handling for invalid input (e.g., negative integers or non-numeric strings), which could lead to unexpected behavior.
