According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `denominator` has been updated to `denominator * total_days`, but we don't have information about the current value of `i` or `k`. However, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented for the next iteration. 

Assuming `i` was at its maximum value for the previous iteration (i.e., `i` was `k - 1`), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `k`, and `k` should be greater than `i`. Thus, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than the current value of `i`.

State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days`, `i` is k, `k` is greater than k**
