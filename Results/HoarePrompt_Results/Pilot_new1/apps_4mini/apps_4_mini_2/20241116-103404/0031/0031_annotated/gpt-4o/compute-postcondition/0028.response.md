The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). If `k` is greater than \(2^n\), the function prints (1, 1) and returns without any further action. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), the function does not execute any further operations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and determine whether to print (1, 1) based on the comparison of `k` and \(2^n\). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than \(2^n\); otherwise, it performs no further actions.**
