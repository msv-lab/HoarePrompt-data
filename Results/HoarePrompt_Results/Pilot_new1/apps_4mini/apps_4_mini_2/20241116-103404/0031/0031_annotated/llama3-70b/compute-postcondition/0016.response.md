The `denominator` is assigned the value of `denominator // gcd`. The initial value of `denominator` is 1, and the value of `gcd` is also 1. Therefore, `denominator` becomes `1 // 1`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `total_days` is 2^n, `gcd` is 1**
