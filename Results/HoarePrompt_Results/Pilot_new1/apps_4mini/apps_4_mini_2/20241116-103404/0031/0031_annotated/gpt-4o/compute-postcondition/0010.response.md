The variable `denominator` is updated with the expression `denominator * total_days % MOD`. The current value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is \(2^n\). Therefore, the new value of `denominator` becomes:

\[
\text{denominator} = 1 * (2^n) \mod 1000003 = 2^n \mod 1000003
\]

The values of `total_days`, `numerator`, and `i` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is \(2^n \mod 1000003\), `i` is 0**
