Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the program prints (1, 1) and returns without any further action. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, the program does not execute any further operations.***
