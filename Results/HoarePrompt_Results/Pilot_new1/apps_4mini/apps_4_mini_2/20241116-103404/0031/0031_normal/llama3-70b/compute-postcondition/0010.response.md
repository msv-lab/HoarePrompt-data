The variable `numerator` is assigned the value of `numerator * (total_days - i)`. The value of `total_days` is `2**n` and `i` is `k`. Therefore, the new value of `numerator` will be `numerator * (2**n - k)`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`; `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`; `i` is k; `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2**n - k)`**
