The code prints the values `1` and `1`. The initial state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD` is not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state includes the values of the variables as they were initially stated, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the output is 1, 1**
