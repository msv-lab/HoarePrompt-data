The value of `denominator` is updated by performing integer division with `gcd`. Since `denominator` is divided by `gcd`, the new value of `denominator` will be `denominator // gcd`. The values of `numerator` and `gcd` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `denominator`.

Output State: **`numerator` is updated by dividing it by `gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, and `denominator` is updated to `denominator // gcd`**.
