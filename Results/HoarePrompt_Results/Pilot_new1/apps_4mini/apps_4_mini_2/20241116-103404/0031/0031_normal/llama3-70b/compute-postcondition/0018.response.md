The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. After executing the function, it returns the values of the numerator and denominator after applying modulo (10). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the values of the numerator and denominator after applying modulo (10). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and returns the values of the numerator and denominator after applying modulo (10).**
