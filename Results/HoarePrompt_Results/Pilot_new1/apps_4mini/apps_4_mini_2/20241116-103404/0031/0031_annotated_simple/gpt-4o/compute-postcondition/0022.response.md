The variable `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, which is calculated as `(denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD`. The values of `p_no_shared` and `p_total` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and the newly assigned value of `A`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD; `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.**
