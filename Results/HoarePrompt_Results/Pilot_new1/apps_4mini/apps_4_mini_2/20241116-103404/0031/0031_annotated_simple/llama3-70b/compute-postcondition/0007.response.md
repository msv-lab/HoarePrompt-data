The variable `numerator` is assigned the value of `numerator * (total_days - i)`. The initial values are `numerator = 2^n`, `total_days = 2^n`, and `i = 1`. Therefore, we can calculate the new value of `numerator` as follows:

1. Calculate `total_days - i`:
   - `total_days - i = 2^n - 1`

2. Update `numerator`:
   - `numerator = 2^n * (2^n - 1)`

Thus, the updated value of `numerator` will be `2^n * (2^n - 1)`.

The other variables `total_days`, `denominator`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n * (2^n - 1), `denominator` is 2^n, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
