To provide the output state, let's summarize the initial state and the effects of the code provided.

Initial State:
- `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`
- `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`
- `p_shared` is calculated as `(denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD`
- `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`
- `B` is assigned the value of `denominator`
- `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`
- `A` is divided by `g`
- `B` is assigned the value of `B // g`

The code snippet provided is:
```
print(A % MOD, B % MOD)
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the print statement:
- The print statement outputs the values of `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`. 
- The values of `A` and `B` have been modified by the operations preceding the print statement, specifically the division by `g` and the integer division of `B` by `g`.

Since the exact values of `numerator`, `denominator`, `MOD`, and the return value of `func_1(A, B)` are not specified, the output state will reflect the operations performed rather than specific numerical values.

Output State: **`A` is modified to `A / g`, `B` is modified to `B // g`, and the output is `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`**.
