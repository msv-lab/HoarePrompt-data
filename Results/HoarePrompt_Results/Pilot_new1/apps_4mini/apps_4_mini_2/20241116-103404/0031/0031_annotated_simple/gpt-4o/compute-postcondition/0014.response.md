According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `k` must be greater than 1, since `k` is currently unspecified but is stated to be greater than or equal to 1.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `k` to be greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n; `numerator` is updated to (previous_numerator * (2^n - 1)) % MOD; `denominator` is (2^(2n)) % MOD; `k` is greater than 1; `i` is 2**
