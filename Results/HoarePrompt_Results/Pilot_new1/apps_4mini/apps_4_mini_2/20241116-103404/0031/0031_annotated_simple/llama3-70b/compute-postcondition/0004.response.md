The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days - i`. The initial value of `numerator` is 1, `total_days` is `2^n`, and `i` is 0. Thus, the calculation becomes `numerator *= (2^n - 0)`, which simplifies to `numerator = 1 * (2^n)`. Therefore, `numerator` becomes `2^n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
