The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` through user input, calculates the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, and prints the result. The function does not handle cases where the input does not satisfy the constraints (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000), nor does it return any value; it only prints the output.
