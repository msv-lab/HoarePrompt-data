The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the constraints that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the value of `abs(x - y)` will always be positive since `x` is always greater than `y`. However, without specific values for `x` and `y`, we cannot determine the exact output. 

Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, and the output is the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` which is a positive integer.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, and the output is `abs(x - y)`**
