To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to modify an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to one of side length `y`, ensuring that at every moment the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., the lengths of the sides must remain positive integers).

### Program:
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Output Hints:
The function takes two integers, `x` and `y`, as input and calculates the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which is then printed. It is noted that the function does not handle cases where the input does not satisfy the constraints (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000).

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - The expression `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of full steps of 2 that can be taken from `x` to `y`.
   - The expression `(x - y) % 2` checks if there is an additional step needed if the difference is odd.
   - Together, this expression calculates the total number of modifications needed to change the side length from `x` to `y`.

2. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic seems to align with the requirement to reduce the side length from `x` to `y` while ensuring that at each step, the lengths of the sides remain valid for a triangle.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are both even or both odd, as well as when one is odd and the other is even.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle cases where the input does not satisfy the constraints. However, the problem description guarantees that inputs will always satisfy the constraints (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000).
   - Given the constraints, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

4. **Output Hints Agreement**:
   - The output hints state that the function does not handle invalid input cases, which is true; however, since the problem guarantees valid input, this does not affect the correctness of the logic itself.
   - The hints do not provide any contradictory information regarding the correctness of the logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to modify the triangle's side length from `x` to `y`, adhering to the constraints and ensuring the triangle remains non-degenerate throughout the process. Since the provided logic works correctly for all valid cases described in the problem, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The calculation `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` accurately represents the minimum number of modifications needed to achieve the desired side length while maintaining the triangle's validity.
