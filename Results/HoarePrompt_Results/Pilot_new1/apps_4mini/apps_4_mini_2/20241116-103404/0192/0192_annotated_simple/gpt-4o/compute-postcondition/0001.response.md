The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the result based on the values of `x` and `y`. The first part, `(x - y) // 2`, performs integer division of the difference between `x` and `y` by 2, while the second part, `(x - y) % 2`, computes the remainder when the difference is divided by 2. The overall result is the sum of these two calculations.

Since `x` is a new integer value and `y` is a new integer value such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided. However, we know that `x - y` will always be a positive integer.

Thus, the output state will reflect that the result of the calculation has been printed, but without specific values for `x` and `y`, we cannot provide a numerical output.

Output State: **`x` is a new integer value, `y` is a new integer value such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and the result of the computation `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` has been printed.**
