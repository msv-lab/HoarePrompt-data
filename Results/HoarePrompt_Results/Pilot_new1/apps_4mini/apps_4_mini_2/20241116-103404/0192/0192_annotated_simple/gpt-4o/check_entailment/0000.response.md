To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code in the context of the problem requirements.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Problem Description Recap:
- We start with an equilateral triangle of side length `x`.
- We want to transform it into an equilateral triangle of side length `y`.
- The transformation must maintain the triangle's properties, meaning the side lengths must remain positive integers.
- We need to determine the minimum number of seconds (or operations) required to achieve this.

### Understanding the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `x` and `y`.
2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the number of operations needed.
   - `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of complete pairs of reductions we can make.
   - `(x - y) % 2` checks if there's an additional operation needed if the difference is odd.

### Evaluating the Logic:
- The maximum number of operations needed to reduce `x` to `y` is when we decrease the sides down to `y` while making sure that at no point does any side length become zero or negative.
- The program seems to calculate the operations based on the difference between `x` and `y`, which is appropriate since each operation can reduce a side length by 1.
- However, the program does not seem to account for the fact that we need to ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate throughout the process.

### Potential Case:
Let's consider a specific case:
- **Input**: `x = 4`, `y = 3`
  - The difference `x - y = 1`, so the expected output should be `1` because we can directly reduce one side from `4` to `3` in one operation.
  - The program calculates `(4 - 3) // 2 + (4 - 3) % 2` which equals `0 + 1 = 1`. This is correct.

Now consider:
- **Input**: `x = 5`, `y = 3`
  - The difference `x - y = 2`, so the expected output should be `2` (reduce one side from `5` to `3` directly).
  - The program calculates `(5 - 3) // 2 + (5 - 3) % 2` which equals `1 + 0 = 1`. This is **incorrect** since we need `2` operations.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed in cases where the difference is even. It does not handle the case where multiple operations are required to ensure that the triangle remains non-degenerate.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **False**
