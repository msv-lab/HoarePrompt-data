To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the code and its logic closely.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We start with an equilateral triangle of side length `x`.
- We want to modify it to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y`.
- The modification must maintain the properties of a triangle (non-degenerate).
- The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code is:
```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Code Annotations:
- The function reads two integers `x` and `y`.
- It calculates the result of `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` and prints it.

### Logical Breakdown:
1. The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` can be simplified:
   - `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of full two-unit reductions we can make to the sides.
   - `(x - y) % 2` accounts for any remaining unit that cannot be paired.
   - Together, this expression computes the total number of seconds required to reduce the side lengths from `x` to `y`.

2. However, we need to ensure that the triangle remains non-degenerate during the process. This means that at no point can any side become zero or negative, which is inherently guaranteed by the constraints provided in the problem (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000).

### Edge Cases:
- The constraints ensure that `y` is always less than `x` and at least 3, preventing any invalid triangle configurations.
- The code does not directly handle any cases where `y` could be equal to or greater than `x`, but since the problem guarantees `y < x`, this is not a concern.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly computes the minimum number of seconds to transition from a triangle of side length `x` to one of side length `y`, adhering to the problem constraints and ensuring the triangle remains valid throughout the modifications.

Thus, after analyzing the code, its annotations, and the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct for all valid inputs as defined by the problem.

Correctness: **True**
