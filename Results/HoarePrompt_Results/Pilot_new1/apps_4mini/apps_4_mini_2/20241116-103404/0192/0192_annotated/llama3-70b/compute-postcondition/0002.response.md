The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). Based on these constraints, the function likely performs some calculations or checks involving these two integers. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the output description. 

Since there are no explicit cases or return values described, we cannot define the functionality clearly. Therefore, we can only state the accepted constraints for the integers.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the specific return value or functionality is not defined.**
