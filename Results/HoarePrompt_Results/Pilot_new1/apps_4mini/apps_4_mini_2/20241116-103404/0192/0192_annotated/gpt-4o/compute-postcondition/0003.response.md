Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from user input, calculates the result of the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, and prints the result. It does not accept any parameters directly and does not return a value. The output depends on the values of `x` and `y`, and it handles both positive and negative integers as input.**
