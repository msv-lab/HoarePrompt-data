Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean indicating whether `a[i] - x` was found in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `assigned` is a list that may be empty or has enough elements for the loop iterations. If `assigned` is empty or has fewer elements than required, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False, leading to the potential increase of `m` by 1.***
