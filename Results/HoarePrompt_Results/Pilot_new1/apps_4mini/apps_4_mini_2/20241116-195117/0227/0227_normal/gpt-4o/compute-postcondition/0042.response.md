Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, indicating that `a[i] - x` was not found in `assigned` during any iteration. `m` may be increased by 1 if the loop did not execute, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `assigned` is a list with at least as many elements as the number of loop iterations or is empty.***
