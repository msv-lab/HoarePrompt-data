Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, and in this case, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged (or is set to False) while `i` is still 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `assigned` remains a list with at least 2 elements.***
