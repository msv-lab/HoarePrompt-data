The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer a_k satisfies (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer a_k satisfies (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9)**
