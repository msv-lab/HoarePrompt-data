The value of `m` is incremented by 1. Since `m` can be either 1 or 2, after the increment, `m` will be either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2**
