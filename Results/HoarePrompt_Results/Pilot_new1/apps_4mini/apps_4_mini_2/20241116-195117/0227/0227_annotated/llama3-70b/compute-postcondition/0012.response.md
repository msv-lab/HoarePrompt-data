`m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 3, and `m` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 3, and `m` is increased by 1**
