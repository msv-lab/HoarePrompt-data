The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. Since `can_form` is already `True`, its value remains unchanged. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `x`, and `n`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is that `can_form` is `True`, and the states of the other variables remain as they were initially.

Output State: **`can_form` is True**
