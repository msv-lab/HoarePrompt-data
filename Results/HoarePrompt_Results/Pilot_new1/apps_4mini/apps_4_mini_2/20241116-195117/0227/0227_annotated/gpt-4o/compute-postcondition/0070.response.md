The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 23\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer \(a_k\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_k \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the program returns the value of `m`, which represents the count of elements in the list `a` that could not be formed with the previous elements. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers `a`, and return the count of elements that could not be formed with previous elements, or 1 if there is only one element in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers, returning the count of elements that could not be formed with previous elements, or 1 if n is 1.**
