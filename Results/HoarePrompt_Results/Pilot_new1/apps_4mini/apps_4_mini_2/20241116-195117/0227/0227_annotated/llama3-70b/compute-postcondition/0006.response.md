The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 1, and `m` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 1, and `m` is increased by 1**
