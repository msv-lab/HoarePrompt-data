Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the value of `a[3] - x` is found in the list `assigned`, indicating that the condition for breaking out of the loop has been met. If the condition is not satisfied, `can_form` remains unchanged, and no action is taken regarding the loop's execution. Additionally, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is set to 3, and `x` represents the fourth element of `assigned`, with the requirement that `n` is greater than 3.***
