Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the value of `a[4] - assigned[4]` is found in the list `assigned`, in which case `m` is increased by 1 and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged, and `m` is not altered. Additionally, `i` is 4, `x` is the fifth element of `assigned`, `n` is greater than 3, and `assigned` has at least 5 elements.***
