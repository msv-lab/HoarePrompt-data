The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and since it is stated that `m` is an integer greater than or equal to its initial value, it will now be greater than its previous value. The other variables (`can_form`, `assigned`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `m`.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to its initial value plus 1, `assigned` is unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, and `x` remains undefined**.
