The value of `can_form` is assigned to `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, so the output state remains the same for the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False**
