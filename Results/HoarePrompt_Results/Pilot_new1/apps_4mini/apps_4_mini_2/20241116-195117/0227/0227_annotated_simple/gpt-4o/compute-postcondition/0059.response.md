The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is greater than its initial value, `assigned` is a non-empty iterable with at least two elements, `i` is equal to `n`, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
