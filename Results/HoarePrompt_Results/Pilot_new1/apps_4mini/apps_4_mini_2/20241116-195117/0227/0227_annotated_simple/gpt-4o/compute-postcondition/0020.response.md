Output State: **`can_form` will be set to True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and that element is also in `assigned`. If no such element exists after all iterations, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` contains only one element, the loop executes once, and if the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False.**
