Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` (where `x` is the first element of `assigned`) is present in `assigned`. `m` remains an integer greater than its initial value, while `assigned` remains a non-empty iterable, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, and the values of `m`, `assigned`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
