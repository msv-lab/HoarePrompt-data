To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and the logic it implements.

### Program Analysis

The program `func_1(n, a)` is designed to find the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform a sequence of operations based on the distinct positive integer sequence `a`.

1. **Sorting the Input**: The program starts by sorting the input list `a`. This is crucial because the operations depend on the ability to form sums from previously assigned values.

2. **Initialization**: The first element of `a` is assigned to the first variable `b_1`, so `m` starts at 1, and `assigned` is initialized with the first element of `a`.

3. **Iterating Through the Sequence**: The program then iterates through the remaining elements of `a` (from index 1 to n-1):
   - For each element `a[i]`, it checks if it can be formed by summing any two distinct elements from the `assigned` set.
   - If it cannot be formed, it increments the variable count `m` (indicating that another variable is needed).
   - It adds the current element `a[i]` to the `assigned` set.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the value of `m`.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Single Element Case**: When `n = 1`, the program correctly returns `1`, as only one variable is needed.

2. **Impossible Cases**: The program does not handle cases where it's impossible to perform the operations as described. For example, when the sequence is strictly decreasing or when the sum of any two previously assigned variables cannot produce the next required value.

### Example of Failure

Consider the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
- The program should return `-1` because it's impossible to form `5` using the previously assigned variables `3` and `6`.
- However, the program will incorrectly return `2` because it will increment `m` when checking `5`, thinking it needs one more variable.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement, particularly when it's impossible to perform the operations with the given sequence. Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
