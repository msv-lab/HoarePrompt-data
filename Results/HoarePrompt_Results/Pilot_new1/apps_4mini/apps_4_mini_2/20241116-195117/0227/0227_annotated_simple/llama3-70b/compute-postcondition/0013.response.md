Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` is incremented by 1, resulting in `m` being either 3 or 4. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, the value of `m` remains unchanged (either 2 or 3).***
