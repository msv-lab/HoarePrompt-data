The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates on the internal constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`. 

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details regarding the specific outputs based on the conditions or computations performed within the function, we cannot define the exact return values or conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates based on the internal constraints of positive integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and distinct integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k). The specific output of the function is not defined based on the provided information.**
