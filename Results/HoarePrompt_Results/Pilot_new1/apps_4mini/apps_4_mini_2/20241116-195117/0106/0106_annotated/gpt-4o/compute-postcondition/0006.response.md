Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values from `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. If `floor_a` is greater than 1, then `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1. This ensures that the calculation accounts for all possible values of `floor_a`, including the edge case where `floor_a` is exactly 1 or any value greater than 1.***
