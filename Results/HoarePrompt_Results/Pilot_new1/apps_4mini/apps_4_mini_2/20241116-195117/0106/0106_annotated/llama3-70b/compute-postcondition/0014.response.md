Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters directly but reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum time required to travel between the floors and blocks represented by `a` and `b` in a building with `n` blocks and `m` floors per block, where each block transition takes 15 minutes and each floor transition takes 5 minutes. The output is the total minimum time calculated as the sum of block and floor transition times, which is printed. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range from 1 to `n·m·k`.**
