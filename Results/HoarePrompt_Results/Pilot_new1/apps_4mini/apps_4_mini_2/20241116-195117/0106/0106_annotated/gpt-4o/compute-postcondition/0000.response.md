The variable `block` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `m` and `k` are positive integers, and since `apartment` is a distinct integer between 1 and `n * m * k`, the calculation for `block` will yield a positive integer as well. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
