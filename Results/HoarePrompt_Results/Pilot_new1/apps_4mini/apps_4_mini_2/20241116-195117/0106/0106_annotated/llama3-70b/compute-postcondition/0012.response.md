Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to new input values; `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range 1 to n·m·k; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; the result of `print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)` is displayed.**
