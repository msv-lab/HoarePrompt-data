The variable `b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The previous values of `b`, `m`, and `k` are used for the calculation. The calculation is based on the distinct integers `a` and `b` that are within the range 1 to `n路m路k`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, and `b_floor`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to new input values; `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range 1 to n路m路k; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1.**
