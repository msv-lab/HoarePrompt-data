The value of `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor` and both are in the range of 1 to `m`, we can denote their values as follows:

1. `a_floor - b_floor` is a positive integer since `a_floor` > `b_floor`.
2. The multiplication by 5 and the addition of 10 will yield a specific value for `min_floor_time`.

Since the exact values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are not provided, we can only express `min_floor_time` in terms of their difference.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `min_floor_time` is computed based on the difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor`.

Output State: **`min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
