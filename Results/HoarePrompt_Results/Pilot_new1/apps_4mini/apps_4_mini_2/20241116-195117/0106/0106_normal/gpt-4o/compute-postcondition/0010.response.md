The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The value of `floor_b` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `time_to_target_floor`. The state of `min_walk_time` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `min_walk_time` and the new variable `time_to_target_floor` which depends on `floor_b`.

Output State: **`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`**
