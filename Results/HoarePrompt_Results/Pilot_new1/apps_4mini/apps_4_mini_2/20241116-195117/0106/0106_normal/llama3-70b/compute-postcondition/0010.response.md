The variable `min_floor_time` is calculated using the formula `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given the initial state, we know that `a_floor` is in the range 1 to `m`, `b_floor` is also in the range 1 to `m`, and `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`. 

The calculation involves the difference `(b_floor - a_floor)`, which is non-negative due to the constraints provided. Thus, `min_floor_time` will be computed as follows:

1. Calculate the difference: `b_floor - a_floor`.
2. Multiply the difference by 5.
3. Add 10 to the result.

The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of `min_floor_time` based on the specified formula.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `a_floor` is in the range 1 to m; `b_floor` is in the range 1 to m; `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10.**
