The function `get_location` accepts an integer parameter `apartment`. It calculates the `block` and `floor` based on the input `apartment` and two other variables, `m` and `k`, which are not defined within the function but are presumably defined elsewhere in the program. The function returns a tuple containing the `block` and `floor` values.

However, the code does not handle any edge cases explicitly, such as negative or zero values for `apartment`, or if `m` and `k` are not set to appropriate positive integers. If `m` or `k` are set to zero or negative, it could lead to unexpected behavior or division errors. The annotations also do not mention these potential issues.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment` and returns a tuple containing the `block` and `floor` calculated based on `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, but does not handle potential edge cases such as invalid values for `apartment`, `m`, or `k`. **
