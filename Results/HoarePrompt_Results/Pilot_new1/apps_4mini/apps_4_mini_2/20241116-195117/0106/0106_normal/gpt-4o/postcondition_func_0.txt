The function accepts five integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` define the dimensions of a building and `a` and `b` represent specific locations within that building. It calculates the total time to exit from location `a` to location `b`, considering the time to exit the floor, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The function returns the total time as an integer.
