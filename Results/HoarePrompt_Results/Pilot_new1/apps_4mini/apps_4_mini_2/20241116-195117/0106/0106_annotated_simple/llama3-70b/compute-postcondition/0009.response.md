Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are integers; `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `k`; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15.***
