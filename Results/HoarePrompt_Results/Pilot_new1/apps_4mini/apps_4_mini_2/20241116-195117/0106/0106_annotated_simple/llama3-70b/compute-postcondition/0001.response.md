The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the input values, which are converted to integers from a space-separated string. The previous values of `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers, but they are updated with new values from the input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new positive integer values from input; `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new positive integer values from input; `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from input**
