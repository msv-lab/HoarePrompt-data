To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`
   - `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`
   - `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`
   - `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The line `total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor` assigns a new value to `total_time`.
   - This value is calculated by summing the values of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

3. **Output State**:
   - The variables `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` remain unchanged by this operation.
   - The value of `total_time` is now defined as the sum of the three variables mentioned.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5; `total_time` is calculated as time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor.**
