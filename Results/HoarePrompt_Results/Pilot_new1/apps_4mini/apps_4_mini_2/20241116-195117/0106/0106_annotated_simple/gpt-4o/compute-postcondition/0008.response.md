To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state.

1. The initial state indicates that `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`. However, the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are not provided, so we cannot compute `direct_walk_time`.

2. The code snippet calculates `reverse_walk_time` as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. This means that `reverse_walk_time` is assigned a value based on the same variables involved in `direct_walk_time`.

3. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`, we can only describe the relationships between these variables.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of `reverse_walk_time` without specific numerical results:

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**
