Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are integers; `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1 and (b - 1) % m + 1, respectively; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 and (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, respectively; `min_block_time` is calculated based on `a_block` and `b_block`; the output is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
