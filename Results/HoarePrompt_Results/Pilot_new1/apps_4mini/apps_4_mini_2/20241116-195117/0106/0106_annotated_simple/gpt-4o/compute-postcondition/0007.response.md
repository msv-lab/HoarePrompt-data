The variable `direct_walk_time` is assigned the value of `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`. The values of `block_a` and `block_b` are derived from the initial state, but the exact values of `block_a` and `block_b` are not provided. Therefore, we can only express the relationship involving these variables.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `abs(block_a - block_b)` is an absolute difference between two integers `a` and `b`, which are also constrained within the range of 1 to `n * m * k`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculation of `direct_walk_time` based on the provided formula without specific values for `block_a` and `block_b`.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15**
