Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, if `floor_a` is greater than 1, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1. This covers the case where `floor_a` can be exactly 1 or any integer greater than 1, ensuring all possible values of `floor_a` are accounted for.***
