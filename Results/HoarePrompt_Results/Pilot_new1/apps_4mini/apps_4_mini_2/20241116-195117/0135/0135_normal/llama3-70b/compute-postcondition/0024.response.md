The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as indicated by the absence of parameters in its definition. However, it is implied that it operates on two integers `n` and `k`, which are constrained by the conditions 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details on the output or behavior of the function, we cannot determine its specific functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but operates on integers n and k, constrained by 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The output is unspecified.**
