Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it checks the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during these calculations, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not handle the case where `k` is less than 1, which means the loop would not execute, and it would return 'Yes' by default in that scenario.**
