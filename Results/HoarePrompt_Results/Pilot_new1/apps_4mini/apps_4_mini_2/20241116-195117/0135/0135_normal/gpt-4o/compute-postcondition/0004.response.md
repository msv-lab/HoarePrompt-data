According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1, since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `k + 1`. Given that `n` and `k` are both integers within the specified range, the important factor here is that `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 1, which is the first value in the range. The `seen_remainders` set does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but it will be empty at the beginning.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 1 and that `i` starts at 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` ≥ 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
