The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, where both are integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values after the assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
