The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the execution of the program immediately. This means that no further code will be executed, and the current state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and 'No' is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and 'No' is printed.**
