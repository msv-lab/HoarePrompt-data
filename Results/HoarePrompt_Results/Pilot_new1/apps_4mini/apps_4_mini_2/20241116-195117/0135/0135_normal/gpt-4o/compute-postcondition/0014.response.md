Output State: **If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute up to `k` times, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`. The variable `remainder` can take values from 0 to `n-1`. If any `remainder` has been seen before (i.e., it is in `seen_remainders`), the function returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, `seen_remainders` will contain all remainders observed during the loop's execution. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set.**
