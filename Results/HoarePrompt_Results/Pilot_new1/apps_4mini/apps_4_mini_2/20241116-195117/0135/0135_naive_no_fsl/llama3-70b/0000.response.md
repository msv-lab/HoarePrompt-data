Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when \( k \) is greater than \( n \). Specifically, when \( k > n \), the remainders for \( n \mod i \) for \( i \) in the range from \( n+1 \) to \( k \) will all be equal to \( n \) since any integer greater than \( n \) will yield a remainder of \( n \) when divided by \( n \). 

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 5
k = 10
```
The remainders computed would be:
- \( 5 \mod 1 = 0 \)
- \( 5 \mod 2 = 1 \)
- \( 5 \mod 3 = 2 \)
- \( 5 \mod 4 = 1 \)
- \( 5 \mod 5 = 0 \)
- \( 5 \mod 6 = 5 \)
- \( 5 \mod 7 = 5 \)
- \( 5 \mod 8 = 5 \)
- \( 5 \mod 9 = 5 \)
- \( 5 \mod 10 = 5 \)

In this case, the remainders are not distinct, yet the program would incorrectly conclude that they are distinct since it only checks up to \( k \). Thus, the program fails to account for this scenario. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
