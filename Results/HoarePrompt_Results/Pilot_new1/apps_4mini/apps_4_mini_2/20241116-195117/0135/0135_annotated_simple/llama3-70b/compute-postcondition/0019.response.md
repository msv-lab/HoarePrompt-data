Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` includes 0 and potentially 1, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is now `n % 3`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution beyond this point.***
