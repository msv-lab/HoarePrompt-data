The function accepts two integer inputs, `n` and `k`, and checks for unique remainders when `n` is divided by all integers from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and 'Yes' will be printed since there are no remainders to check.
