To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and see if it adheres to the problem description.

The problem requires us to check if the remainders of `n` when divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The program works as follows:

1. **Check if `k >= n`:** 
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program immediately returns 'No'. This is because the remainders for `1` and `n` will be the same (`n % n = 0`), hence they cannot all be distinct. This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Iterate from `1` to `k`:** 
   - For each integer `i` in this range, the program calculates the remainder `n % i`.
   - It checks if this remainder has already been seen (i.e., if it is in the `seen_remainders` set). If it has, the program returns 'No'.
   - If it hasn't been seen, it adds the remainder to the set.

3. **Return 'Yes':** 
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the program returns 'Yes'.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Case where `k < n`:** 
  - The program correctly checks for duplicates in the remainders generated from `1` to `k`. However, we need to consider a specific case where `k` is significantly smaller than `n`. For example, letâ€™s take `n = 10` and `k = 5`. The remainders would be:
    - `10 % 1 = 0`
    - `10 % 2 = 0`
    - `10 % 3 = 1`
    - `10 % 4 = 2`
    - `10 % 5 = 0`
  - Here, the remainders `0` appears multiple times (for `1`, `2`, and `5`), which means they are not distinct. The program will return 'No', which is correct.

- **Case where `k` is very large:** 
  - If `k` is greater than `n`, as previously mentioned, it will always return 'No' due to the overlap of `n % n`.

- **Case where `k = 1`:** 
  - For `n = 7` and `k = 1`, the remainder is `7 % 1 = 0`. The program will return 'Yes', which is correct since there is only one remainder.

However, there is a potential oversight in the program logic regarding the distinctness of remainders. Specifically, when `k` is close to `n`, the program does not account for the fact that some numbers might produce the same remainder for different values of `i` in the range `1` to `k`. 

For instance, if `n = 9` and `k = 6`, the remainders would be:
- `9 % 1 = 0`
- `9 % 2 = 1`
- `9 % 3 = 0`
- `9 % 4 = 1`
- `9 % 5 = 4`
- `9 % 6 = 3`

Here, the remainders `0` and `1` are repeated, leading to the conclusion that not all remainders are distinct. However, since `k` is less than `n`, the program would return 'Yes', which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to correctly identify non-distinct remainders in certain situations.

Correctness: **False**
