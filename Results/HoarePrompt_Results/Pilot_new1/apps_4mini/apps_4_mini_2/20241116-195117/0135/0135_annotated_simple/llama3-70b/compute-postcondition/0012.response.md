The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, and the program does not return any value. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the addition of the termination of the program. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now includes 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, the output is 'No', and the program terminates.**
