According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range function `range(1, k + 1)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to and including `k`. The variable `i` will start at 1 during the first iteration of the loop. 

Since `n` does not affect the execution of the loop, it can remain unchanged. The state of `seen` being an empty set does not impact the loop's execution either.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` should be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
