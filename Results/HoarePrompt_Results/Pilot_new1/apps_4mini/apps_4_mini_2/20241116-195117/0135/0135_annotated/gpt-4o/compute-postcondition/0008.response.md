Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is already present in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, the function does not return anything and the state remains unchanged.***
