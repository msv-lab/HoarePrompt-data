The code `seen.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n % 2`, where `n` is an input integer. Since `seen` already contains `0`, the effect of this code will depend on the value of `remainder`. 

If `remainder` is `0`, it will not change the state of `seen`, as sets do not allow duplicate values. If `remainder` is `1`, it will add `1` to the set. In either case, the program continues without printing 'No' since the code is executed after checking if `remainder` is in `seen`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- If `remainder` is `0`: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is 0.
- If `remainder` is `1`: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains 0 and 1, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains 0 (and possibly 1), `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**.
