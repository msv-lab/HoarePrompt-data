Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 0, `n`, `x`, `s` are input values, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring all edge cases related to the balance and divisibility conditions are accounted for.***
