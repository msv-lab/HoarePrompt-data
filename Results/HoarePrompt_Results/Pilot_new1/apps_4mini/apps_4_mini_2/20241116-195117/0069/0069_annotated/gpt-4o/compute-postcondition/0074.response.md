Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 2. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented to 3; otherwise, `count` remains 2. This includes the cases where `x - b` is negative or not a multiple of `balance`, ensuring that all edge cases regarding the divisibility and non-negativity of the result are covered.***
