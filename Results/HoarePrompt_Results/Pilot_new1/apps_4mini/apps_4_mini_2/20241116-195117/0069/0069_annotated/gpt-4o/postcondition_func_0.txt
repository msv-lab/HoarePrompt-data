The function accepts an integer `T` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in the string and constructs a list of prefix balances. If the overall balance is zero, it checks if `x` is in the list of prefix balances, returning -1 if true and 0 otherwise. If the balance is not zero, it counts how many prefix balances can be adjusted to reach `x` and returns that count. If `n` or `T` is zero, the function handles these cases appropriately, resulting in no output.
