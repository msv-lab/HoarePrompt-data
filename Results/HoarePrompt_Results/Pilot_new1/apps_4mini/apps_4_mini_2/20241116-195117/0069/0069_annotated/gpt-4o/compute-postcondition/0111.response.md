Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size at least 2 initialized with zeros, `n` is at least 1, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, `x` is an integer, `balance` is a non-zero integer, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This ensures that `count` only increments when the difference `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`.***
