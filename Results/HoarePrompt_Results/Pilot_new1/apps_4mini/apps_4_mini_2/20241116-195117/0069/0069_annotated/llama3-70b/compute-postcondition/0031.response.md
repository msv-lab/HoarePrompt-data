The code executes a print statement, which outputs `-1`. The values of the other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints `-1`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints `-1`.**
