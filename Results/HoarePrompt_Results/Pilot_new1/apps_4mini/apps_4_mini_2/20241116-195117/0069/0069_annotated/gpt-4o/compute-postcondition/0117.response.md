Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` containing cumulative balances of '0's and '1's from the string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1; otherwise, it includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` contains the count of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, reflecting the number of valid balances that can be adjusted to reach `x`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, `prefix_balances` remains a list with a single element [0], and `results` remains empty. If `T` is 0, the outer loop does not execute, and `results` remains empty.**
