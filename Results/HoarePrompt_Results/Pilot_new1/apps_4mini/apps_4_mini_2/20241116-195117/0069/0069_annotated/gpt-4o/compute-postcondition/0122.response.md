According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `results` must contain at least 3 elements, and `result` should be the third element in the list.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size greater than 1, `results` contains at least 3 elements, and `result` is the third element in the list**
