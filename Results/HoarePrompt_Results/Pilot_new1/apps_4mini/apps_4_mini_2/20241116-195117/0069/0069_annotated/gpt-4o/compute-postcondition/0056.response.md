Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, initialized with the cumulative balance based on the characters in string `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, updating `prefix_balances[i]` to represent the balance after processing the first `i` characters of `s`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.**
