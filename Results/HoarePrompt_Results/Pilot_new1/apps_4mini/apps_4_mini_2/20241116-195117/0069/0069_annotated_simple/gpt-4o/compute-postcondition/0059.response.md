The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The state of `prefix_balances` and `balance` remains unchanged, as this operation only affects the `results` list. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and the cumulative balance `balance` is equal to 0; `results` now includes `-1`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and the cumulative balance `balance` is equal to 0; `results` now includes `-1`.**
