The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of `prefix_balances` and `balance` are not affected by this operation. The variable `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, but it does not influence the result of this specific operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the `results` list without changing other variables.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is 0, `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1**
