Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, then at least one of the values from `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]` must contribute to a non-zero cumulative balance based on the occurrences of '0' and '1' in `s`. If `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of size `1` with all elements as 0.***
