The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. 

- `T` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where \( 1 \leq T \leq 100 \).
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the binary string `s`, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).
- `x` is an integer that can range from \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

The function processes these inputs and returns results based on the specified logic for each test case. The exact output behavior is not described, but it is implied that the function will produce some output based on the values of these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (number of test cases), n (length of binary string s), x (an integer), and s (a binary string).**
