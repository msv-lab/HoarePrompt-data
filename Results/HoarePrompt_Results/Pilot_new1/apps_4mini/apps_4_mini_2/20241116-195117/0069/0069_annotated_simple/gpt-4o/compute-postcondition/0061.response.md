The code appends `0` to the `results` list, which does not affect any of the other variables or their states. The previous values of the affected variables are not mentioned, but we know that `results` is modified by adding a new element. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new state of `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, the cumulative balance `balance` is equal to 0, the value `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` is updated to include a new element 0.**
