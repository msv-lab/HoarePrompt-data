The values of `n` and `x` are assigned new values from the input, which are integers obtained from splitting the input string. The previous values of `n` and `x` are not specified, so we cannot determine their new values. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer in the range (-10^9, 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length n**
