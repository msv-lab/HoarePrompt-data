Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s` up to each index from 1 to `n`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1; if `x` is not present, `results` includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. Additionally, if `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, and `results` will not be modified as the loop does not execute.***
