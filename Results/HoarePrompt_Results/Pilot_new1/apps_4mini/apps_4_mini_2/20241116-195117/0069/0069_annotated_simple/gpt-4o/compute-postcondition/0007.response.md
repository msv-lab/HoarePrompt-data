The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is 1, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[2]`. Since `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, and `T` is greater than or equal to 1, we can assume that `data` has at least 3 elements. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]**
