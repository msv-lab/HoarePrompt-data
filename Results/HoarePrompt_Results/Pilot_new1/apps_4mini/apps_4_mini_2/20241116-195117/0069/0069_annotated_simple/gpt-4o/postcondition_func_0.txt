The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` (the length of a binary string `s`), an integer `x`, and the binary string `s`. It calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in `s` and constructs a list of prefix balances. If the overall balance is zero, it checks if `x` is present in the prefix balances, returning -1 if true and 0 if false. If the balance is non-zero, it counts the number of prefix balances that can satisfy the equation `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, returning this count. If there are no test cases, the function returns no results. If `n` is less than 1, it handles the case by not executing the inner loop, resulting in an unchanged state.
