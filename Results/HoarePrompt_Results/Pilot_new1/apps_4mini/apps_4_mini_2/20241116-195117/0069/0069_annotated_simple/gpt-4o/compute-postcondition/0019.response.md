Output State: **`prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s` up to each index from 1 to `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` from index 1 to `n`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**
