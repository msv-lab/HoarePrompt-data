Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0. Additionally, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`, and the expression `(x - b)` is evaluated, which can impact the outcome based on its value relative to `balance`.***
