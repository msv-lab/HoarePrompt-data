Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the net count of '0's minus '1's from the start of the string up to the i-th character. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` based on the values in `s`.**
