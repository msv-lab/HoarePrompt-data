Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, and `balance` is an integer. If `balance` is equal to 0, then if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains `-1`; otherwise, it contains `0`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` contains this `count`. In all cases, the integrity of `prefix_balances` and the value of `balance` are maintained throughout the execution.***
