Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is a positive integer provided that `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and the division is well-defined, ensuring that the case where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` is handled by printing -1.***
