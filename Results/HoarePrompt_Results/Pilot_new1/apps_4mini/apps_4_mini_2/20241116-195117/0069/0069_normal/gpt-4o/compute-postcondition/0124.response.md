According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 4 valid prefix balances, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 3 valid prefix balances, `result` is the third element of `results`, and `index` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must contain at least 4 valid prefix balances, and `result` should be the fourth element in the list. The `index` should be adjusted to 3.

State: **`results` contains at least 4 valid prefix balances, `result` is the fourth element of `results`, `index` is 3**
