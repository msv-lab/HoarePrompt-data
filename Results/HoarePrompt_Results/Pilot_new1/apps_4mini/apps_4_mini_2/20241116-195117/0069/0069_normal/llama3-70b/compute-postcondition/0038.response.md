Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `T`, which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (a positive integer) and `x` (an integer), followed by a binary string `s`. It counts the occurrences of '0's and '1's in `s`, calculates the balance as the difference between these counts, and then determines the output based on the following conditions: if the balance equals `x`, it outputs `n + 1`; if the counts of '0's and '1's are equal and the balance does not equal `x`, the output is undefined; if the balance does not equal `x` and the difference between `x` and balance is divisible by the difference in counts, it outputs -1; otherwise, it calculates and outputs the number of operations required to achieve the desired balance. If `T` is 0, no output is generated.**
