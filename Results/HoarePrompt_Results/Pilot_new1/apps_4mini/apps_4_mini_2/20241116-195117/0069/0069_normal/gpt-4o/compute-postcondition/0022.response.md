The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The `prefix_balances` list remains unchanged, and the `balance` value is still 0. The value `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, but it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `-1` to the `results` list while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, `balance` is 0, `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` has `-1` appended to it.**
