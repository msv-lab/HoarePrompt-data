Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones up to index `n`, `results` is updated based on the value of `balance`. If `balance` is 0, `results` includes -1 if `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, or 0 if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. If `balance` is not 0, `results` includes the count of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. In either case, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, and `index` is increased by 3.***
