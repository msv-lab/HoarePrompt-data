T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, x is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, and s is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The total sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 100000.
