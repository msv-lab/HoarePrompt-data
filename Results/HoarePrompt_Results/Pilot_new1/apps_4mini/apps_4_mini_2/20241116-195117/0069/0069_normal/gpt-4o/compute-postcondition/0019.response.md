Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the balance up to the i-th character of `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or lower (though the initial state specifies `n` is greater than or equal to 1), the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.**
