Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`; `results` is unchanged; `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations; `index` is increased by 3; `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1'); `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 3; `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on the condition of `s[2]`, resulting in `prefix_balances[3]` being either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or '1'.**
