Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with at least one more element, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, and `count` remains unchanged unless `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, in which case `count` is increased by 1. This means if `x` is equal to `b`, `count` will be incremented if `balance` divides `0`, and if `x` is greater than `b`, `count` is incremented if the difference `(x - b)` is non-negative and divisible by `balance`. If `x` is less than `b`, `count` remains unchanged.***
