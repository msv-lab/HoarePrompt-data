Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is a non-empty queue, `r_queue` may be empty or non-empty. The loop will execute, processing 'D' votes against non-'D' votes. After processing, if `d_queue` is empty, all 'D' votes have been processed, and `r_queue` will contain the remaining non-'D' votes with their indices incremented by `n`. If `r_queue` is empty, all non-'D' votes have been processed, and `d_queue` will contain the remaining 'D' votes with their indices incremented by `n`.***
