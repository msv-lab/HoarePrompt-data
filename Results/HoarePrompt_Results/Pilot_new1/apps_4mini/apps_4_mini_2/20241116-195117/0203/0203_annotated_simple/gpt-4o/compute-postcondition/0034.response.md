The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` has at least 1 element, `d_index` will now hold the value of that first element, and `d_queue` will have one less element. The state of `r_queue` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has at least 1 element (now one less), `r_queue` is not empty, and `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least 1 element (now one less), `r_queue` is not empty, and `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`**
