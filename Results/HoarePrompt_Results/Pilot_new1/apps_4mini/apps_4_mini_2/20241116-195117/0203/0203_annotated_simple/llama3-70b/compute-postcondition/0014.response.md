According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `fractions` string. To execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more character left in the `fractions` string after the last iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `fraction` is the next character in the string, which indicates that we are currently processing that character. Since `fractions` is a non-empty string, it must have at least one character remaining for the loop to execute again. 

Given that `fraction` is the next character, we can determine that for the loop to execute one more time, `fractions` must contain at least one more character after the current `fraction`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there are more characters in `fractions`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with at least one more character remaining, `fraction` is the next character in the string, `depublicans` is either 1 or 2, `remocrats` is either 0 or 1**
