The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 1, but the value of `r_queue` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only confirm that `i` is added to `r_queue`, but we cannot determine the contents of `r_queue` before the operation.

The output state will reflect the addition of `i` to `r_queue`. Thus, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`, and `i` has been appended to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`, and `i` has been appended to `r_queue`.**
