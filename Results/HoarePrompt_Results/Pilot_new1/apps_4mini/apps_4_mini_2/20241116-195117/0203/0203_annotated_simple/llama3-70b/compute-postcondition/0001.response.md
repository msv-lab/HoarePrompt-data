The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which will accept a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is a positive integer within the specified range. The output state reflects that `fractions` has now been defined as a string based on user input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' based on user input**
