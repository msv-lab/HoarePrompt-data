The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 2, but we do not have information about `r_queue` in the initial state. The other variables `n` and `votes` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `votes`, and `v`, and notes that `i` has been appended to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character of `votes`, and `i` has been appended to `r_queue`.**
