The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the `d_queue` list. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, and `d_queue` is currently an empty list. After executing the code, `d_queue` will contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the first character of `votes`, `v`, is 'D'**.
