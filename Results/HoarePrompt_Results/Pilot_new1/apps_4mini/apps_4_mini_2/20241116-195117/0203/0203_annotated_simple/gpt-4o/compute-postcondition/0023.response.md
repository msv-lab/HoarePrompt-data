The code appends the value `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. Since `d_index` is less than `r_index`, this operation does not affect the values of `r_queue`, `n`, or `r_index`. The output state will reflect the updated state of `d_queue` with the new value added, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' votes with `d_index + n` appended, `r_queue` has one less element, `n` is the length of the `votes` string, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`.**
