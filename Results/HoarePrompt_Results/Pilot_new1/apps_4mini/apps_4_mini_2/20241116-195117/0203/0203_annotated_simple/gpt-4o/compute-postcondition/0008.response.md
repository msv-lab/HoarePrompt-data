The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue` list. Given that `i` is initially 0, the `r_queue` will now contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is now [0], and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is now [0], and `i` is 0**
