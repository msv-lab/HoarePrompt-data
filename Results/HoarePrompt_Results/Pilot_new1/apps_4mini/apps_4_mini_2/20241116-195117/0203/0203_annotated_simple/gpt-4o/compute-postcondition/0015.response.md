The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The value of `i` is 2, and since `d_queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list or previously defined. Therefore, after the execution, `d_queue` will contain the value 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character of `votes`, and `d_queue` now contains 2**
