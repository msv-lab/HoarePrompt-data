The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, but the specific value of `n` is now determined by user input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input**
