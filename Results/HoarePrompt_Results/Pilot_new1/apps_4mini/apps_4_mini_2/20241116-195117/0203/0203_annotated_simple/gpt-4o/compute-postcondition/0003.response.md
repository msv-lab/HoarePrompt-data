The variable `r_queue` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `votes`, and `d_queue`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer based on user input; `votes` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `votes` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**
