Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string `votes` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters. It processes the votes by simulating a competition between 'D' and 'R' based on their indices. The function continues processing until one of the queues (either 'D' or 'R') is empty, and then it prints 'D' if there are remaining 'D' votes or 'R' if there are remaining 'R' votes. If `n` is less than 1, the function does not process any votes, and the output will depend solely on the initial state of the queues. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not provided or is invalid, which may lead to errors.**
