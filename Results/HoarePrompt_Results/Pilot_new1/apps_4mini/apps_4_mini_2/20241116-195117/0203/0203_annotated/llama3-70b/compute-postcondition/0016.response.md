The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` can either be 0 or 1. Therefore, after execution, `remocrats` can be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is either 1 or 2, `remocrats` is either 1 or 2, and the next character in `fractions` is considered for processing.
