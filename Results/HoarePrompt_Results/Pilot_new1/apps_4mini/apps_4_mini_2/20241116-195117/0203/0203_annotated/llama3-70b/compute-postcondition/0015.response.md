The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `depublicans` can either be 1 or 2, which means the new value of `depublicans` will be either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `remocrats`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is either 2 or 3, and `remocrats` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is either 2 or 3, `remocrats` is either 0 or 1**
