Postcondition: ***`votes` is an empty string or `d_queue` is non-empty. If `d_queue` is non-empty, the loop has executed with `d_queue` containing indices of 'D' characters, and `r_queue` may be empty or non-empty. The last executed value of `d_index` corresponds to the last processed index from `d_queue`. If `r_queue` is non-empty, it consists of the remaining indices of 'R' characters, each incremented by `n` for those that were processed. If `r_queue` is empty, then `d_queue` consists of the remaining indices of 'D' characters, each incremented by `n` for those that were processed. If `n` is less than 1, both queues remain unchanged.***
