`remocrats` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 0, the new value of `remocrats` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1, and the first character of `fractions` is not 'D'.
