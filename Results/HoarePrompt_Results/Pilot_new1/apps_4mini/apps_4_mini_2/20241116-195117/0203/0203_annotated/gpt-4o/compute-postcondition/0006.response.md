The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. Given that `i` is 0, after execution, `d_queue` will contain the single element [0]. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 0, `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 0, `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list**
