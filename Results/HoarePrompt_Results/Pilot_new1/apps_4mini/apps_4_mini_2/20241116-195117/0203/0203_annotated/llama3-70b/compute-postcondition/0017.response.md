Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`. If the next character in `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 (resulting in either 2 or 3), while `remocrats` remains either 0 or 1. If the next character is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 (resulting in either 1 or 2), while `depublicans` remains either 1 or 2.***
