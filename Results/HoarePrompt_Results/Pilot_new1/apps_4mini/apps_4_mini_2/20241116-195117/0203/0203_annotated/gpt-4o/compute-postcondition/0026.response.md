Postcondition: ***`d_index` is the first element removed from `d_queue`, and `d_queue` has one less element. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has one additional element which is `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` has one additional element with the value `r_index + n` appended.***
