Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 2; and `v` is the third character of `votes`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` includes the value 2. Otherwise, if `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` includes the value 2. This covers the case where `v` could be any character other than 'D', ensuring that `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated accordingly based on the value of `v`.***
