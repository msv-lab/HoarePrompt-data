The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The values of `n`, `votes`, `v`, `d_queue`, and `r_queue` remain unchanged except for the `r_queue`, which now includes the value `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `v` is the character at index `i + 1` in `votes`, and `r_queue` has `i` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `v` is the character at index `i + 1` in `votes`, and `r_queue` has `i` appended to it.**
