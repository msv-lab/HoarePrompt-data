The code `d_queue.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `d_queue`. The previous values of `d_queue` are not specified, but they remain unchanged except for the addition of `i`. The variables `n`, `votes`, `v`, and `r_queue` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is less than `n - 1; `v` is the character at index `i + 1` in `votes`; `d_queue` has `i` appended to it; `r_queue` remains unchanged.**
