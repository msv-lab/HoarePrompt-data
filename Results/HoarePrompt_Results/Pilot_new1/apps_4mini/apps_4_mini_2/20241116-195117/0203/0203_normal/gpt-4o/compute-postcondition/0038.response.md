Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one less index. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has the value `d_index + n` appended to it. Otherwise, `r_queue` has the value `r_index + n` appended to it. In both cases, the values of `d_index` and `r_index` remain unchanged, and the operation preserves the integrity of the queues.***
