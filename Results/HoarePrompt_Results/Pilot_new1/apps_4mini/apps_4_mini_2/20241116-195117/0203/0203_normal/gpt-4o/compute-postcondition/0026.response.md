Postcondition: ***`d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` with the first index removed; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` now includes `d_index + n` while `r_queue` remains unchanged and `r_index` is the value of the removed element. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` now includes `r_index + n`, and `r_queue` has an element added. In both cases, `r_index` retains the value of the removed element.***
