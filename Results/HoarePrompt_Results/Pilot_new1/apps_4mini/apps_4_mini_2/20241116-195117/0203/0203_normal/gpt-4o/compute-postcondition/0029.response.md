The operation `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The state of `r_queue` will change as it will now have one less element, while `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less index, `d_index` is the index that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less index, `d_index` is the index that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation**
