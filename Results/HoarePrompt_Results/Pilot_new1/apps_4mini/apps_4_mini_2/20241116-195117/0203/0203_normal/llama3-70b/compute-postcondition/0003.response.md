The variable `remocrats` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `depublicans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
