According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. For the loop to execute, the `fractions` string must contain at least one character, which means `n` should be greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `fraction` will take on the value of the first character in the `fractions` string. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states as follows: `n` must be greater than 0, `fractions` must be a non-empty string, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0 as they are not affected by the loop execution.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
