The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous state, but the exact value of `i` is not provided. The other variables, `n`, `votes`, and `v`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `d_queue` and the current state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `i + 1`; `v` is the character at index `i` in `votes`; `d_queue` has `i` appended to it.**
