Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is not empty, and the loop will execute until one of the queues is empty. After the loop, if `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters that were not paired with 'D' characters, and vice versa. If both queues are empty, all indices have been processed.***
