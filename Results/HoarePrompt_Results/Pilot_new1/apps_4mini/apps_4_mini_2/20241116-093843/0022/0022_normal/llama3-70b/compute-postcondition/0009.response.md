The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the previous values of `s`, `n`, `is_palindrome`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `is_spalindrome` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string input from the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is initially True, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
