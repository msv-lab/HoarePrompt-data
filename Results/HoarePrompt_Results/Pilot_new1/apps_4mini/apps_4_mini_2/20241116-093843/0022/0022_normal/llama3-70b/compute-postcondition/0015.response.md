Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input from the user with length at least 4, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the loop or if statement is exited. If the characters match, `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, and further checks may continue, maintaining the palindrome status.***
