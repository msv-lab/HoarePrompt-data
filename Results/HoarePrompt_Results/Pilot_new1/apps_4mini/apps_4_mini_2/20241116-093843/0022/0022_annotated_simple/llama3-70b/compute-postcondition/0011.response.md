Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string, `n` is at least 2, and `is_spalindrome` is True. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True.***
