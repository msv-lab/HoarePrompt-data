The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`, which overrides its previous value of `True`. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `is_spalindrome` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a new input string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 1**
