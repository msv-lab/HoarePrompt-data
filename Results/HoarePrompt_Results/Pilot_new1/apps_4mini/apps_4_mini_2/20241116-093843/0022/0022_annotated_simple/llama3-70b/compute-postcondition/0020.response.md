Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user, checks if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome or 'NIE' if it is not. It handles cases where the string is empty or has only one character as palindromes, but does not explicitly limit the input length to 1-1000 as mentioned in the annotations.**
