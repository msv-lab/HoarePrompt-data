According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n // 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `n` is at least 4, `n // 2` would be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. 

Since `is_palindrome` is True and the loop body has not been executed yet for `i = 2`, we do not need to adjust `is_palindrome`. 

Therefore, we need to update `i` to 3 for the next iteration, while `n` remains at least 4.

State: **`s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 3**
