Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise it is False. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `n` is 2 or more, the loop will check up to `n // 2` characters, and if any characters do not match their corresponding counterparts, `is_spalindrome` will be set to False.**
