Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, the output is '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not 0, the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than `y`, the output is '?'. The value of `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`, and less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.***
