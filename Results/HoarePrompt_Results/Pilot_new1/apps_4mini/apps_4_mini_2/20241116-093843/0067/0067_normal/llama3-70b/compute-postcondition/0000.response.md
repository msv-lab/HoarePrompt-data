The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input received from the user, which will be converted to integers. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not known, as they will be overwritten by the new input values. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values based on user input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values based on user input**
