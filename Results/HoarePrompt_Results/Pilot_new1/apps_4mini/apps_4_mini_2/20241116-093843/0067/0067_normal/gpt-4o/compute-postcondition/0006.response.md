The `print('-')` statement outputs a hyphen to the console. This statement does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the addition of the printed output.

Output State: **`min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z < y`), and a hyphen is printed.**
