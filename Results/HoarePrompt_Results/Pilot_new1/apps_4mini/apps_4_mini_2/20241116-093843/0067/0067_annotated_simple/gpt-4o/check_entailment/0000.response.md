To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we will analyze the logic implemented in the code against the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The output should be:
   - "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes in all scenarios.
   - "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes in all scenarios.
   - "0" if upvotes are equal to downvotes in all scenarios.
   - "?" if there are multiple scenarios where the result can differ.

### Code Analysis:
The code implements the following logic:
- It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes:
  - `min_upvotes = x`
  - `max_upvotes = x + z`
  - `min_downvotes = y`
  - `max_downvotes = y + z`
  
- It then checks:
1. If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum downvotes (`min_downvotes`), it prints `'-'`.
2. If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum upvotes (`min_upvotes`), it prints `'+'`.
3. If neither condition is true, it prints `'?'`.

### Checking Edge Cases:
1. **Case: `x = 0, y = 0, z = 1`**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - The program would output `'?'`, which is correct because the result can be either `+` or `-` depending on how the unknown votes are cast.

2. **Case: `x = 3, y = 7, z = 0`**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`.
   - The program would output `'-'`, which is correct since downvotes are greater.

3. **Case: `x = 2, y = 0, z = 1`**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - The program would output `'+'`, which is correct because upvotes are greater regardless of the unknown vote.

4. **Case: `x = 1, y = 1, z = 0`**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - The program would output `'0'`, which is correct since upvotes equal downvotes.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and checking multiple edge cases, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. There are no cases where the program fails to provide the correct output based on the input conditions.

Correctness: **True**
