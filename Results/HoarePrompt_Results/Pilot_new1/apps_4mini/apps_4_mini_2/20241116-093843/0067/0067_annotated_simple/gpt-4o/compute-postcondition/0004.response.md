The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The previous values are `y` (an input integer) and `z` (an input integer). Therefore, `max_downvotes` will be the sum of these two input integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
