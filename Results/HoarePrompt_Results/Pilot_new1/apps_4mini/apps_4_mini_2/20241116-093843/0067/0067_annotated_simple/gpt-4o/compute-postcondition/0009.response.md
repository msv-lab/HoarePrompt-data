Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are input integers; `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`; the value of `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `y + z < x`); the value of `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z >= y`); and the output is '+'**
