The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through user input. It calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on these values. The function prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met. The function does not return any value but outputs one of the three symbols based on the comparisons.
