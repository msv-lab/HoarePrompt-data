The value of `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The previous value of `x` is an input integer, and `z` is also an input integer. Therefore, the value of `max_upvotes` will depend on the specific input values of `x` and `z`. The value of `min_upvotes` remains unchanged as it is still `x`. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, and `max_upvotes` is `x + z**
