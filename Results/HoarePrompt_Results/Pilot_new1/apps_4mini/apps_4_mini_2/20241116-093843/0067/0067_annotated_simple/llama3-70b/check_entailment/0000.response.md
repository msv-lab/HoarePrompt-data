To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic against the requirements.

The program reads three integers: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively. The expected outputs are:
- "+" if there are more upvotes than downvotes regardless of the unknown votes.
- "-" if there are more downvotes than upvotes regardless of the unknown votes.
- "0" if upvotes and downvotes are equal and there are no unknown votes.
- "?" if the presence of unknown votes could lead to different outcomes.

Now, let's go through the program step by step:

1. **Condition `if (x > y + z)`**: 
   - This checks if the number of upvotes `x` is greater than the total of downvotes `y` plus unknown votes `z`. If true, it prints `+`. This is correct as it indicates that even if all unknown votes were downvotes, upvotes still outnumber them.

2. **Next condition `if (x < y)`**: 
   - This checks if upvotes are fewer than downvotes. If true, it prints `-`. This is also correct as it indicates that upvotes are outnumbered by downvotes.

3. **Next condition `if (x == y)`**: 
   - Here, it checks if upvotes are equal to downvotes. If they are equal, it checks if `z` is 0. If `z` is 0, it prints `0`, which is correct since there are no unknown votes to change the outcome. If `z` is not 0, it prints `?`, which is also correct because the unknown votes could sway the result.

4. **Final `else`**: 
   - If `x` is not equal to `y`, this prints `?`. This is correct as it indicates that the presence of unknown votes could lead to multiple outcomes.

Now, let's consider edge cases and verify if the program handles them correctly:

- For input `0 0 1`: 
  - Expected output is `?` since the unknown vote could either be an upvote or a downvote, making the result uncertain. The program correctly prints `?`.

- For input `3 7 0`: 
  - Expected output is `-` since there are more downvotes than upvotes. The program correctly prints `-`.

- For input `2 0 1`: 
  - Expected output is `+` since even with one unknown vote (which could be a downvote), upvotes still outnumber downvotes. The program correctly prints `+`.

- For input `1 1 0`: 
  - Expected output is `0` since upvotes equal downvotes with no unknown votes. The program correctly prints `0`.

After analyzing the program and considering various scenarios, the logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
