The code executes a print statement, which outputs the character '+'. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, and their specific values do not affect the output of the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; '+' is printed**
