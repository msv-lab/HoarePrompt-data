To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the code and the annotations, as well as the examples provided in the problem description.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. There are three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The output can be:
   - "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes.
   - "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.
   - "0" if upvotes are equal to downvotes.
   - "?" if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

### Analyzing the Code:
The code checks the following conditions:
1. If `x > y + z`, it prints "+" (indicating that even with all unknown votes going to downvotes, upvotes are still greater).
2. If `x < y`, it prints "-" (indicating that upvotes are less than downvotes).
3. If `x == y`, it checks:
   - If `z == 0`, it prints '0' (indicating equal votes with no uncertainty).
   - If `z > 0`, it prints '?' (indicating uncertainty because the unknown votes could sway the result).
4. If `x > y` but not greater than `y + z`, it prints '?' (indicating uncertainty because the unknown votes could potentially change the outcome).

### Annotations Analysis:
The annotations describe the states of the program after each decision point and summarize the logic being implemented. They confirm that:
- The program correctly identifies cases where the result is uncertain.
- The program handles the edge cases of equal votes and no unknown votes correctly.

### Testing the Examples:
1. **Input:** `3 7 0` → Output: `-` (Correct)
2. **Input:** `2 0 1` → Output: `+` (Correct)
3. **Input:** `1 1 0` → Output: `0` (Correct)
4. **Input:** `0 0 1` → Output: `?` (Correct)

### Potential Edge Case:
Let’s consider the case where `x = 5`, `y = 5`, and `z = 5`. The expected output should be "?" because:
- If all unknown votes go to upvotes, the result is "+".
- If all unknown votes go to downvotes, the result is "-".
Thus, there are multiple possible outcomes, which the code correctly identifies as uncertain. 

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, the annotations, and the examples from the problem description, all cases are handled correctly according to the specifications. There are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the voting outcome based on the problem description for all potential cases.
