The code snippet prints the string `'?'`, which does not modify any of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. The initial conditions regarding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. The value of `z` is not equal to 0, the value of `x` is equal to `y`, the value of `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and the value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (x <= y + z).**
