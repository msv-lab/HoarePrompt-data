Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user and prints the nearest multiple of 10. If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n` itself. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`. The function does not return any value. **
