To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break it down step by step.

### Problem Description:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` already ends with 0, it is considered rounded. The output must be the nearest multiple of 10.

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

1. **Check if n is a multiple of 10**: 
   - If `n % 10 == 0`, it prints `n`. This correctly handles cases where `n` is already rounded (e.g., `100`, `0`).

2. **Check if the remainder is less than or equal to 5**:
   - If `n % 10 <= 5`, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 using `n - n % 10`. This is correct for values like `5`, `15`, `25`, etc., which should round to `0`, `10`, `20`, etc.

3. **Check if the remainder is greater than 5**:
   - If `n % 10 > 5`, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 using `n + (10 - n % 10)`. This is correct for values like `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, which should round to `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`, etc.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case where `n = 5`**: The program will output `10`, which is one of the correct answers. So this is handled correctly.
- **Case where `n = 0`**: The program will output `0`, which is correct.
- **Case where `n = 10`**: The program will output `10`, which is correct.
- **Case where `n = 1`**: The program will output `0`, which is correct.
- **Case where `n = 999999999`**: The program will output `1000000000`, which is correct.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function prints the nearest multiple of 10 based on the logic described above, and it confirms the behavior of the program in various scenarios. The hints are consistent with the code's logic.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the code against the problem description and examples provided, the program correctly handles all potential cases as described. There are no edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of rounding `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0.

Correctness: **True**.
