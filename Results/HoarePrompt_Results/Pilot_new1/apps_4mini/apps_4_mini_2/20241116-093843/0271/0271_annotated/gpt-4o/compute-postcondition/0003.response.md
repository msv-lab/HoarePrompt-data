The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Given that `remainder` is the last digit of `n` and is less than or equal to 5, `result` will be a non-negative integer. The state of `n` and `remainder` remains unchanged, but `result` is now defined.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and `remainder` is less than or equal to 5; `result` is `n - remainder`.**
