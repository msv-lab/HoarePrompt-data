The expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` calculates the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than `n`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, not divisible by 10, and `n % 10` is greater than 5, we can determine that the value of `n + (10 - n % 10)` will yield a result that is the next multiple of 10 after `n`.

Since `n % 10` is greater than 5, the expression `10 - n % 10` will yield a positive integer that, when added to `n`, results in a number that is a multiple of 10.

Thus, the output state will reflect that the value of `n` is unchanged, and the result of the print statement is the next multiple of 10 after `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, `n % 10` is greater than 5; the result of print is the next multiple of 10 after `n`.**
