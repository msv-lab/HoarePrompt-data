To determine the output state, we analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

1. `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
2. `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, which means \(remainder = n \mod 10\).
3. It is stated that `remainder` is greater than 5, which implies that `remainder` can be 6, 7, 8, or 9.

The code snippet:
```
result = n + (10 - remainder)
```
This means:
- We are calculating `result` by adding `n` to the difference between 10 and `remainder`.

Given that `remainder` can be 6, 7, 8, or 9, we can calculate the possible values for `result`:

- If `remainder = 6`, then:
  \[
  result = n + (10 - 6) = n + 4
  \]
- If `remainder = 7`, then:
  \[
  result = n + (10 - 7) = n + 3
  \]
- If `remainder = 8`, then:
  \[
  result = n + (10 - 8) = n + 2
  \]
- If `remainder = 9`, then:
  \[
  result = n + (10 - 9) = n + 1
  \]

Thus, the `result` can take on multiple forms depending on the value of `remainder`.

The output state will reflect the possible outcomes for `result` based on the values of `n` and `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is greater than 5; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`.**
