According to the code, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. Since `s` is specified as a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it can be empty or contain up to 1,000,000 digits. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `s` is not empty. The variables `t`, `t_set`, and `n` do not directly affect whether the loop executes, but they can be included in the state for clarity.

Given that `s` is a string of digits, to ensure the loop executes, we need to set `s` to a non-empty string of digits. We can also initialize `c` to the first character of `s` at the start of the loop.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is an empty string**
