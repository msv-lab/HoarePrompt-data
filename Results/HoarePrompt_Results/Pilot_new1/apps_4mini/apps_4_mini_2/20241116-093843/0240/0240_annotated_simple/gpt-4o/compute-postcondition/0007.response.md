The `yield` statement returns the value of `candidate`, which is equal to `perm`. The values of the other variables, `chars` and `perm`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`**
