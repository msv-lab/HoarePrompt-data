The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold this specific permutation as a string. The initial state of `chars` remains unchanged, but `candidate` now contains the value of `perm`. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
