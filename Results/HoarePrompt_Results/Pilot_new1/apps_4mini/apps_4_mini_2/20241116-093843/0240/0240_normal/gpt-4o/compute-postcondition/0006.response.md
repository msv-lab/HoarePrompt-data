The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the string formed by joining the elements of `perm`. Since `perm` is defined as the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be a string that represents this next permutation. The state of the other variables (`chars` and `perm`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
