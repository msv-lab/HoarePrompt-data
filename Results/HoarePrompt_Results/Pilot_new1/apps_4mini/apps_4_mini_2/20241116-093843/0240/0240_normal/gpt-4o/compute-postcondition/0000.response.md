According to the code, the loop will execute if the `permutations` function can generate at least one permutation from `chars`. The `permutations` function requires that `chars` is not an empty string; otherwise, it will not generate any permutations. Since `chars` is specified to be a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it can be empty or contain digits. 

For the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one digit. Additionally, since `perm` will represent a permutation of `chars`, it will be initialized to the first permutation when the loop starts.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are that `chars` must contain at least one digit, and `perm` should be the first permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 digit, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
