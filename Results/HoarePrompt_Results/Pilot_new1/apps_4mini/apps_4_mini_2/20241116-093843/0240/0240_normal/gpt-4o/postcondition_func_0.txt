The function accepts two non-empty strings of digits, `s` and `sub`, and returns the smallest number that can be formed by combining the remaining characters in `s` (after removing the characters found in `sub`) with the characters in `sub`. If there are no remaining characters in `s` after the subtraction, the function will return an error or unexpected result depending on the behavior of the `generate_possible_numbers` function.
