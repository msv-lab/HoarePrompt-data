Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, and `n` is a string that may contain the second character of `s`. If the second character `c` of `s` is in `t_set`, then `n` is modified by appending `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains unchanged.***
