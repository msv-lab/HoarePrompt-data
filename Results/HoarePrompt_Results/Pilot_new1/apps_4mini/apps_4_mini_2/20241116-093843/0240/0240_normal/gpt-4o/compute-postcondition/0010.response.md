The variable `candidate` is assigned the value that results from joining the elements of the list `perm`. The variable `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `chars` is a string of digits. After executing this line, `candidate` will contain the string representation of the next permutation of the digits in `chars`. The state of `chars` and `perm` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining the next permutation of `chars`.**
