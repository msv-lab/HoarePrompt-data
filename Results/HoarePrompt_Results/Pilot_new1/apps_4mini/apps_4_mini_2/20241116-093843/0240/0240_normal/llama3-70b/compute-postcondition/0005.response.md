Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is a string that may contain the first character of `s` if that character is in `t_set`. If the first character `c` of `s` is present in `t_set`, then `n` is set to `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains an empty string.***
