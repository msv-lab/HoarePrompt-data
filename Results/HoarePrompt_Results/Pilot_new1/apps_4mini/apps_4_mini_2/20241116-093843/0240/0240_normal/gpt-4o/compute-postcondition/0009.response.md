According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of `chars`. The loop will continue executing until all permutations have been generated. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` must be updated to the next permutation in the sequence.

Since `perm` is already defined as the next permutation of `chars`, the next state should reflect that `perm` is now the subsequent permutation. As the loop iterates through all permutations, it is important to ensure that `perm` is updated correctly to reflect the next permutation. Additionally, since `candidate` is formed by joining `perm`, it should also be updated accordingly.

The state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `perm` should be the next permutation after the current one.
- `candidate` should be the string formed by joining this new `perm`.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining the next permutation of `chars`.**
