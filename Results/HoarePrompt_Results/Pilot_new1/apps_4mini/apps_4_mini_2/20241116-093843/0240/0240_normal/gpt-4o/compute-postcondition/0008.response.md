Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, the function does not yield anything.***
