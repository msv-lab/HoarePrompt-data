To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a shuffled string `s` and a known substring `t` of `n`. The reconstructed integer must not have leading zeros unless it is zero itself.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
        
    n += t
    return int(n)
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t_set` is created from the substring `t` to allow quick membership testing.
   - An empty string `n` is initialized to build the final number.

2. **Building `n`**:
   - The `for` loop iterates through each character `c` in `s`.
   - If `c` is found in `t_set`, it gets appended to `n`.

3. **Appending `t`**:
   - After the loop, the entire substring `t` is appended to `n`.

4. **Returning an Integer**:
   - Finally, `n` is converted to an integer and returned.

### Annotations Summary:
- The annotations describe the state of `n` after the loop, stating that it contains characters from `s` that are present in `t_set`, followed by `t`.
- It also indicates that if `s` is empty or does not contain characters from `t`, `n` will just be `t`.

### Validating Against the Problem Description:
- The program constructs `n` by taking characters from `s` that are in `t` and then appending `t`. This does not guarantee that the smallest integer is formed.
- For example, consider the input:
  ```
  s = "003512"
  t = "021"
  ```
  The program would produce `30021`, which is correct. However, if we consider:
  ```
  s = "199966633300"
  t = "63"
  ```
  The program produces `3036366999`, which is also correct.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle the case where the smallest possible integer could be created by rearranging digits differently. For instance, if `s` contains digits that can form a smaller integer when combined with `t`, the program would fail to find that combination.
- If `s` contains leading zeros and the only digits available to form `n` are zeros, the resulting integer could be invalid.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee the construction of the smallest integer `n` as required by the problem description. The logic of appending `t` after building `n` from `s` does not ensure the smallest possible value.

Thus, there are potential cases where the program does not work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
