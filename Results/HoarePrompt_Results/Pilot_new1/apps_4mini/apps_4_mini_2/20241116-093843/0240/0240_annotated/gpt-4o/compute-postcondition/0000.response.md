According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. For the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one character; otherwise, there would be no permutations to generate. Since `chars` is defined as a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it is guaranteed to have at least one character. 

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` will represent one permutation of `chars`. However, the starting state of `perm` is not defined until the loop begins, as it will be assigned a new permutation in each iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `chars` is a non-empty string.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
