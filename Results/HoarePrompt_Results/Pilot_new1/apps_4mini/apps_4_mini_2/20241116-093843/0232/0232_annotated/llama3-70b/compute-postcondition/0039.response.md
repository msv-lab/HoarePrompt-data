Postcondition: ***`color` is the second element of `colors`, `found` is set to True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then we break out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, the values of `found`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
