Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If all counts match, `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged with `i` equal to 1, `n` greater than 3, and `j` equal to 3. Additionally, `window_counts[color]` is either 1 (if `color` was not previously present) or incremented by 1 (if `color` was already present).***
