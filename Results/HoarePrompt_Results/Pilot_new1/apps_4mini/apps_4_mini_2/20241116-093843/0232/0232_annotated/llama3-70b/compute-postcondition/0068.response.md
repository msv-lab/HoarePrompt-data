Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and `color` is colors[2]. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0; otherwise, `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
