The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 4, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
