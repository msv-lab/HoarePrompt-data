According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop iterates starting from `i` and goes up to `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 3.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 3 and increment `j` to 4.

State: **`found` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 4**
