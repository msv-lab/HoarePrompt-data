Output State: **`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` for any `j` in the range from `i` to `n - 1`. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is 0), `found` remains False, `i` is 0, `j` is not defined, and `window_counts` is still an empty dictionary. If `n` is greater than 0 but no matching counts are found, `found` remains False, and `window_counts` contains the counts of colors encountered up to `j = n - 1`.**
