Postcondition: ***`color` is the third element of `colors`, `found` is set to True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the program continues without altering `found`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.***
