Postcondition: ***`found` remains unchanged unless it is True, in which case the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` takes values from 2 up to `n-1`. The `window_counts` dictionary contains counts of colors from the `colors` list starting at index `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If the condition `all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts))` is never met during the iterations, `found` will also remain unchanged.***
