The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. The value of `j` is 1, so `color` now takes the value of the second element in the `colors` list. The states of the other variables (`found`, `i`, `n`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `color` is the second element of `colors`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`color` is the second element of `colors`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
