The variable `counts` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will contain a list of integers obtained from the input. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `colors` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `counts` is now a list of integers from the input, while `n`, `m`, and `colors` retain their prior states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `colors` is a list of integers from the input, and `counts` is a list of integers from the input**
