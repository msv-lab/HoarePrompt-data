The variable `left` is assigned the value of `0`. This assignment does not affect the other variables (`n`, `m`, `colors`, `k`, `desired_counts`, `current_counts`) in any way. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑ `k[i]` ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 1 to `m` to the corresponding value in `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int), and `left` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑ `k[i]` ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 1 to `m` to the corresponding value in `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int), and `left` is 0.**
