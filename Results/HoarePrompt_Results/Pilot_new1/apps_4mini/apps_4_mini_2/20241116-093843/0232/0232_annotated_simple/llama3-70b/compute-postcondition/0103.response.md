The value of `found` is set to `True`, changing its previous state from `False`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `window_counts[color]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `found` while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`found` is True, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is 1**
