Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop terminates immediately, leaving `i` unchanged, `j` takes values from `i` to `n-1`, and `window_counts` remains unchanged. If `found` is False, the loop continues executing (if applicable), `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `n`, and `window_counts` contains the counts of colors processed up to that point. If the loop does not execute due to `n` being less than or equal to `i`, `found` remains False, `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.***
