The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i + 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `found` is True, and `j` is equal to `i + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.
