The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new value of `left`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ sum(`k`) ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the respective counts in `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict of int initialized to 0 for any missing keys, `left` is 0**.
