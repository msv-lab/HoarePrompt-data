Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first element in the colors list, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and `color_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `color_counts`, no changes are made to the dictionary.***
