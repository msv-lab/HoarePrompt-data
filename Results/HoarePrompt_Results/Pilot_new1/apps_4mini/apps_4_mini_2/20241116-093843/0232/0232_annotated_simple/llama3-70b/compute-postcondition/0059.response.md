Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `i` is n-2, `n` is greater than n-1, and `j` is n-2. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, resulting in `window_counts` containing the key-value pair {color: 0}. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
