The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
