The variable `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. This means that the previous value of `window_counts[color]` is overwritten, and it is set to `0`. The values of `color`, `j`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is now `0`.

Output State: **`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `j` is i + 1, `n` is greater than i + 1, and `window_counts[color]` is now 0**
