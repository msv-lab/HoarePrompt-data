The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is n-2, `n` is greater than n-1, `j` is n-2, and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or the previous value plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.
