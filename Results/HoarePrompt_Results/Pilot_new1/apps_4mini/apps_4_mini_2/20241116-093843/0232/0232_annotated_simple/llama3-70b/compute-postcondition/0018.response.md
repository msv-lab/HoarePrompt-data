Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where keys are the unique integers from the `colors` list and values are the counts of occurrences of those integers. If `colors` is an empty list, then `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ n).**
