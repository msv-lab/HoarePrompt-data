Output State: **`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after executing the loop. If the loop executes, `j` will take values from `i` to `n-1`, and `window_counts` will contain the counts of colors from `colors` indexed by `j`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, leaving `found` as False, `i` unchanged, `j` unchanged, and `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. If the loop executes but the condition is never met, `found` remains False, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `n`, and `window_counts` will contain the counts of colors processed up to that point.**
