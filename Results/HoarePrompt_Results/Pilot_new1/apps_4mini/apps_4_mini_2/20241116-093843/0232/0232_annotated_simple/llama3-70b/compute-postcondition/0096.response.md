The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is n-1, `j` is n-1, `n` is greater than n-1, `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1 (or set to 1 if it was not present), and all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` after being sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
