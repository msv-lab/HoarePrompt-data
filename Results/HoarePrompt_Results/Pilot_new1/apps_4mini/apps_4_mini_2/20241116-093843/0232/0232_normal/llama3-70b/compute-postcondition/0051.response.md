The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is still 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is at least 0 and at most `n-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
