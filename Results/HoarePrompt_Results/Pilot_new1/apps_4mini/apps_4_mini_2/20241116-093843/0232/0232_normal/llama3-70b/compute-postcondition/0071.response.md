The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged; `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop.
