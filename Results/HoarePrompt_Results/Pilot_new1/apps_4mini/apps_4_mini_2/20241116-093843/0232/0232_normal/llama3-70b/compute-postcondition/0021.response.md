The statement initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The variables `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and their previous values do not affect the new state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `window_counts` is now an empty dictionary while the other variables maintain their previous values.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is {}**
