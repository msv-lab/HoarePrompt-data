Postcondition: ***`color` is `colors[3]`, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, and `color_counts` remains unchanged. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
