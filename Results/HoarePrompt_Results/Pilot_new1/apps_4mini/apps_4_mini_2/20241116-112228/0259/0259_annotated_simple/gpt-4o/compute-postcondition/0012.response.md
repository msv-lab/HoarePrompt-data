Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is a positive integer reflecting the time until the next bus arrives. This covers all scenarios, including edge cases where `s_i` is exactly equal to `t` or where `s_i` is less than `t` but very close, ensuring that `wait_time` is appropriately calculated in all situations.***
