The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the value of `chosen_route` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a positive integer that is less than `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a positive integer that is less than `min_wait_time`**.
