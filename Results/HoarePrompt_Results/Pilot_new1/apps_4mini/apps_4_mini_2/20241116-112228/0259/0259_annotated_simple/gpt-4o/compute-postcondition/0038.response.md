Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated based on the bus routes and the time `t`, reflecting the shortest wait until the next bus. `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route (1-based) that offers this minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, while `chosen_route` remains -1. If all `s_i` values are less than `t` and no bus arrives after `t`, `min_wait_time` may still be updated based on the calculated wait times, ensuring all edge cases, including equalities and mod conditions, are handled.**
