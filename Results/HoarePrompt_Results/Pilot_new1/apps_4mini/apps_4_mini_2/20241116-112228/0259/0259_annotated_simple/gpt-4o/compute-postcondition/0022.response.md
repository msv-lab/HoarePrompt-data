Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` remains unchanged unless `wait_time` is less than it. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that it remains non-negative and respects the boundaries defined by `min_wait_time`. Additionally, `chosen_route` is 2, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.***
