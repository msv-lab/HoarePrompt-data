The function reads an integer `n` (the number of bus routes) and an integer `t` (a specific time) from input. It then collects `n` tuples of integers `(s, d)` representing the start time and the duration of each bus route. The function calculates the minimum time until the next bus departs after time `t` and returns the 1-based index of that bus route. If there are no bus routes (`n` is 0), it returns -1.
