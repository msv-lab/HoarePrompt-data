The value of `wait_time` is assigned the result of `s_i - t`. Given that `t` is a positive integer and `s_i` is assigned a value from `bus_routes[i]`, the specific value of `wait_time` will depend on the values of `s_i` and `t`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `chosen_route` is 2, and `min_wait_time` remains unchanged unless `wait_time` is less than it, the output state will reflect the calculation of `wait_time` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` remains unchanged unless `wait_time` is less than it, `chosen_route` is 2, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`**
