According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` variable. The loop will execute if there is at least one tuple in the `buses` list. Since `buses` contains `n` tuples of integers `(s, d)`, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. At the start of the loop, the index `i` will be 0, and the first tuple `(s, d)` will be the first tuple in `buses`.

State: **`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`**
