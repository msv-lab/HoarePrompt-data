The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the index (1-based) of the bus with the earliest next departure time. Since the initial state indicates that `ans` remains -1 (this can happen if `buses` is empty or if all bus times are greater than or equal to `min_time`), the output will reflect that unchanged state.

Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum time calculated as `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is -1, and the function prints -1**.
