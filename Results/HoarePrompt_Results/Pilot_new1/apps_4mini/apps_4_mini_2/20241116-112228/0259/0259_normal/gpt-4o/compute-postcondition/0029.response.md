The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is a value from `bus_routes[n]` and `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, the exact value of `wait_time` will depend on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`. 

Since `s_i` is not defined in the initial state, it remains unknown, but `t` is known to be a positive integer between 1 and 100000. Therefore, the output state reflects the dependency of `wait_time` on these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `s_i` is a value from `bus_routes[n]`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`**
