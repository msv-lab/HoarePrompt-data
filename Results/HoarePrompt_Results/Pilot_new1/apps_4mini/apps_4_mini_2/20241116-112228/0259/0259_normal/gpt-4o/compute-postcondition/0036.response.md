Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, no changes occur to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`. This ensures that the minimum wait time is accurately tracked based on the calculated `wait_time` for the given bus schedule.***
