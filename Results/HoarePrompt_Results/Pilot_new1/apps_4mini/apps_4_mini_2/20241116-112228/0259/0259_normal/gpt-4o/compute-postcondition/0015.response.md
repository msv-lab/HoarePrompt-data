The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied that `i` is a non-negative integer since it is typically used as an index in such contexts. Therefore, `chosen_route` will be one more than whatever value `i` holds. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `i` can take any non-negative integer value, the output state reflects that `chosen_route` is dependent on `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
