To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The code calculates `wait_time` using the formula: `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
2. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, we assume that `bus_routes[n]` provides valid values for `s_i` and `d_i`.
3. The variable `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000.
4. The calculation involves determining the wait time based on the current time `t`, the start time `s_i`, and the duration `d_i`.

Since we don't have the specific values for `s_i` and `d_i`, we can't compute a specific numerical value for `wait_time`. However, we can express it in terms of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`; wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.**
