The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from the `input()` function, which accepts two space-separated integers and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. The specific values of `s` and `d` will depend on the user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` and `d` are now defined based on the input, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are input integers**
