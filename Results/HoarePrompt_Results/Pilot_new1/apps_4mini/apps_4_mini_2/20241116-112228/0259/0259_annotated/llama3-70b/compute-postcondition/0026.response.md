According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the `buses` list. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the number of tuples in `buses`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `buses` contains at least 2 tuples. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and the tuple `(s, d)` should be the third tuple in the list.

State: **`buses` contains at least 3 tuples of integers `(s, d)`, `i` is 2, and `(s, d)` is the third tuple in the list**
