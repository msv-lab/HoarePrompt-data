According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be increased by 1. Since `n` is currently a positive integer, it can be adjusted to `n + 1`. The values of `t` and `buses` do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly related to the loop's execution count.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, `n` is greater than 100**
