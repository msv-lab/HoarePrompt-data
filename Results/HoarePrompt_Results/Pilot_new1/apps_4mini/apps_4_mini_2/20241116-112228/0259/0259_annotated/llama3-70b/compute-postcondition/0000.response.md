The variables `n` and `t` are assigned values from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer. The values of `n` and `t` are not specified, but they remain within the given constraints. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n` and `t` from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000)**
