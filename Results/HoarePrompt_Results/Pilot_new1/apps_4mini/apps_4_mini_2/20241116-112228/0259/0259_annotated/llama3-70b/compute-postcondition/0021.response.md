According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more tuples in `buses` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, meaning the loop has processed the first tuple `(s, d)` in `buses`. Since `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and the loop must access the next tuple in `buses`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 1.
- The tuple `(s, d)` should be updated to the second tuple in `buses`.

State: **`buses` contains at least 2 tuples of integers `(s, d)`, `i` is 1, `(s, d)` is the second tuple in `buses`**
