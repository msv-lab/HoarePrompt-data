Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 3 tuples of integers `(s, d)`; `i` is 2; `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d` for the third tuple. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 3. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
