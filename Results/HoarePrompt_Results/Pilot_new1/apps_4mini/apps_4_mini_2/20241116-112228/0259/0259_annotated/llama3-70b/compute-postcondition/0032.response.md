Output State: **If `buses` contains at least 1 tuple of integers `(s, d)`, then `min_time` will be updated to the minimum time calculated as `(t - s) % d` for the tuples processed, and `ans` will contain the index (1-based) of the tuple that gave the minimum time. If `buses` is empty (i.e., `n` is 0), the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains float('inf') and `ans` remains -1.**
