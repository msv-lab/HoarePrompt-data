The variable `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given the conditions that `(t - s_i)` is not divisible by `d_i`, it implies that `(t - s_i) % d_i` will yield a non-zero value. Therefore, `wait_time` will be a positive integer derived from the calculation.

The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected by this calculation. Hence, the output state reflects the values of the unchanged variables and the new calculated value of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are values from bus_routes[0], and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**.
