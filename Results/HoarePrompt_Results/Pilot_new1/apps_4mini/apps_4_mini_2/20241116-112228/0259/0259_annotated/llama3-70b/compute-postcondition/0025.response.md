Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 2 tuples of integers `(s, d)`, `i` is 1, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time` and `ans` is set to 2. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, then `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
