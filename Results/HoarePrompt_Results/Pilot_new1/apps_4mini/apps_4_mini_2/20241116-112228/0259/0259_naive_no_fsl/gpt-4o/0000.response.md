To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `n`: Number of bus routes.
   - `t`: The time Serval arrives at the bus station.
   - Each bus route has:
     - `s_i`: The time the first bus of that route arrives.
     - `d_i`: The interval at which subsequent buses arrive.

2. **Expected Output**:
   - The bus route number that Serval will take, which is the one that arrives at or after time `t` and has the least wait time.

### Logic in the Code:
1. The function initializes `min_wait_time` to infinity and `chosen_route` to -1.
2. It iterates through each bus route:
   - If the first bus arrives (`s_i`) after `t`, it calculates the wait time as `s_i - t`.
   - If the first bus arrives exactly at `t`, the wait time is `0`.
   - If Serval arrives between two buses of that route, it calculates the wait time as the time until the next bus arrives.
3. It keeps track of the minimum wait time and the corresponding bus route.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **First Bus Arrives Before Serval**: If `s_i < t`, the program correctly calculates the next bus time using the interval `d_i`.
2. **Multiple Buses Arriving at the Same Time**: The program can return any of the routes that have the same minimum wait time, as required by the problem description.
3. **Serval Arrives Exactly at the Time of the First Bus**: The program handles this case correctly by setting wait time to `0`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: When `t` is less than all `s_i`. The program should return the first bus route.
- **Case 2**: When `t` is equal to one of the `s_i`.
- **Case 3**: When `t` is between two bus arrivals of a route.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering the various edge cases, the program appears to handle all potential scenarios correctly. 

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies the bus route Serval will take based on the given input conditions and matches the problem description requirements.
