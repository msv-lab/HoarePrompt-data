The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained by the condition that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained by the condition that \( 0 \leq k \leq 8 \). The function calculates a value `x`, which is determined by the expression \( n \times \left(\frac{\text{multiplier}}{\text{math.gcd}(n, \text{multiplier})}\right) \). The exact value of `multiplier` is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a non-negative integer k, and returns the value of x, which is calculated based on n and a multiplier using the greatest common divisor (gcd).**
