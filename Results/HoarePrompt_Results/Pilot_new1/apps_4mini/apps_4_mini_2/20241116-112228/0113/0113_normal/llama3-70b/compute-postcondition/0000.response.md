The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input().split()` takes the input as a string and splits it into parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts those parts into integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not specified since they are to be taken from user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
