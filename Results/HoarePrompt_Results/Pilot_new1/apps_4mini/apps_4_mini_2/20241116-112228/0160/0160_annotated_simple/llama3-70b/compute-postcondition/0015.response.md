Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or greater than `gcd`, `i` is 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers, and the product of `i` and `i` is not equal to `gcd`.***
