The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `gcd` is at least `(i + 1)`, it implies that `i` can take values less than or equal to `gcd - 1`. However, without specific values for `max_divisor` and `i`, we cannot determine the exact outcome of the assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum value between its previous state and `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is at least `(i + 1)`; `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`**
