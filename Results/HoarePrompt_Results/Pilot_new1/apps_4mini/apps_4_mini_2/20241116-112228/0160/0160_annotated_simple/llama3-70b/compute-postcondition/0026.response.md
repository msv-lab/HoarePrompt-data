The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. The variable `gcd` is at least `(i + 1)`, which means `gcd // i` will yield a value that is at least `1` (since `gcd` is greater than `i`). The previous value of `max_divisor` will be compared with this new calculated value. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `max_divisor` based on the maximum of its previous state and `gcd // i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is at least `(i + 1)`; `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`**
