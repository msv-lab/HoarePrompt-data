Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(x))`, and if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` and `x // i` are both added to the `divisors` set. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, no changes are made to the `divisors` set. This ensures that all divisors of `x` up to `i` are considered, capturing edge cases where `x` is a perfect square or has `i` as a divisor.***
