Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., the remainder of `x` divided by `i` is 0).***
