Output State: **`max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(gcd)`. If `gcd` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd`. If `gcd` is 1, the loop executes only once with `i` equal to 1, and `max_divisor` remains 1. If `gcd` is a perfect square, `max_divisor` will be updated only once for that `i`. If `gcd` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `max_divisor` retains its initial value equal to `gcd`.**
