Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from input, and if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged and retains the maximum of its previous value and 3.***
