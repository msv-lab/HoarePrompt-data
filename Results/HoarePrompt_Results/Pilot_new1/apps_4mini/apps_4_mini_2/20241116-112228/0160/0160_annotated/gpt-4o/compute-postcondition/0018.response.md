The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `x` and calculates all of its divisors. It does this by iterating from 1 to the square root of `x`, checking for divisibility, and adding both the divisor and its complement (i.e., `x // i`) to a set called `divisors`. After completing the loop, the function returns a sorted list of these divisors in descending order. 

However, if `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set, resulting in an empty list being returned. Additionally, the function does not handle negative integers or zero explicitly, which could lead to unexpected behavior in those cases.
