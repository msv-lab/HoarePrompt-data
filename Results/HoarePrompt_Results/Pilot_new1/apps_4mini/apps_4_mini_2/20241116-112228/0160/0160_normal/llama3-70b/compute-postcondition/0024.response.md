According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `gcd`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, if `i` is currently equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, then it needs to be adjusted to `i` being `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, which would make it exceed the limit for the next iteration.

State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, and `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`**
