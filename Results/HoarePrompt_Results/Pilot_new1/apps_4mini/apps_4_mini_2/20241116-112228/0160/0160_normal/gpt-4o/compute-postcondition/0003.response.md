The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` is initially an empty set, after this operation, it will contain the value of `i`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `divisors` now contains `i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `divisors` contains `i`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1.**
