Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive); `divisors` is a set containing `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, indicating that both `i` and the quotient are divisors of `x`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the set `divisors` remains unchanged and empty. Additionally, `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1.***
