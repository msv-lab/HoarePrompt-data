According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and `x` is at least 4. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`.

To determine the next state:
- If `i` is currently `k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to `k + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue must still hold, which means `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`.

Since `x` is at least 4, `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least 2. Therefore, if `i` is currently less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented correctly, and we must also check that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is sufficient to allow for one more iteration.

Thus, the state should be updated to reflect that `i` is now `k + 1` and that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least `k + 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive); `divisors` is a set containing `1`, `2`, and `x // 2` if `x` is divisible by `2`; `x` is at least 4; `i` is `k + 1`, and `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least `k + 1`**.
