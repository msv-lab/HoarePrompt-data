The code initializes an empty set called `divisors`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `A` are not affected by this line of code, as it only creates a new variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of the variables and the new empty set.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), and `divisors` is an empty set.**
