Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive); `divisors` is a set containing `1`, `2`, and `x // 2` if `x` is divisible by `2`; `x` is at least 4. If `x` is even, `2` and `x // 2` are added to the `divisors` set. If `x` is odd, the `divisors` set remains unchanged, containing only `1`.***
