The code adds `i` to the `divisors` set. The initial state indicates that `i` is 2, and since `divisors` already contains `1`, after executing the code, `divisors` will now also include `2`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive); `divisors` now contains `1` and `2`; `x` is at least 4; `i` is 2.**
