Output State: **`max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(gcd)`, and `gcd` is at least 1. If `gcd` is a perfect square, `max_divisor` will not include the square root itself unless it is the only divisor. If `gcd` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `max_divisor` remains equal to its initial value, which is `gcd`. If `gcd` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `max_divisor` will remain 1.**
