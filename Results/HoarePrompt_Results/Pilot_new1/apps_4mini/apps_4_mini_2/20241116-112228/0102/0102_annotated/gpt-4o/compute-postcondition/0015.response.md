Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99 and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place as `tens[n // 10]`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens-ones', where `tens[n // 10]` represents the tens place and `ones[n % 10]` represents the ones place. This includes all values of `n` from 10 to 99, covering edge cases such as 10, 20, ..., 90 for multiples of ten, and values like 11, 12, ..., 19 for the teens. If `n` is outside the range of 10 to 99, the function does not execute the if block.***
