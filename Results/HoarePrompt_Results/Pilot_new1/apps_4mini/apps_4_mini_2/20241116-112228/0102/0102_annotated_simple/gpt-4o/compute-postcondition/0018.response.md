The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representation from the `ones` list corresponding to `n`. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, and `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` formatted as "tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]". Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its string representation based on the defined conditions for numbers in that range.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns the string representation of n based on its value: from the ones list for 0-9, from the teens list for 11-19, from the tens list for multiples of 10 between 10-99, or a formatted string for non-multiples of 10 between 10-99.**
