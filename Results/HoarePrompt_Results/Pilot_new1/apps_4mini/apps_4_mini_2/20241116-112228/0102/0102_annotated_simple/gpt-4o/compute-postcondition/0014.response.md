Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string corresponding to the tens place of `n` from the `tens` array. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` formatted as "tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]", ensuring all values of `n` within the specified range are correctly represented.***
