The code prints a string representation of the integer `s` in words. The value of `s` is greater than or equal to 20. The tens place is calculated using `s // 10`, and the ones place is calculated using `s % 10`. The corresponding words are fetched from the `tens` and `ones` lists. 

Since `s` is at least 20, `s // 10` will be at least 2, which means the tens place will correspond to 'twenty' or higher. The ones place will determine if there is an additional word appended (if not zero).

The output will be the concatenation of the appropriate tens word and the ones word, separated by a hyphen if the ones place is not zero.

Output State: **`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 20; the printed output is the string representation of `s` in words.**
