To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem states that Nicholas has a permutation of size `n` containing distinct integers from `1` to `n`. The goal is to find the maximum distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) after performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions in the array.

### Code Analysis
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)
posn = a.index(n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

1. The code reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct integers.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
3. It calculates `max_dist`, which is the maximum possible distance after one swap, and also calculates `min_dist`.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Already Maximized Distance**: If `1` and `n` are already at the ends of the list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`), the code should still account for the swap, but the output may not reflect the maximum distance correctly.
2. **Minimum Input Size**: For `n = 2`, the only permutation is `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`. The code should handle this correctly since the maximum distance is `1` regardless of the swap.
3. **Invalid Input Handling**: The code does not handle cases where the input does not meet the expected format or if the integers are not distinct. However, the problem guarantees valid input.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints state that the function calculates the maximum distance and does not handle cases where the input does not meet the expected format or if the integers are not distinct. This aligns with the code's functionality.

### Conclusion
The code does not account for the scenario where `1` and `n` are already at the maximum distance, and it incorrectly adjusts the distance calculation by subtracting 1 unnecessarily. For example, in the case of the input `[1, 6, 5, 3, 4, 7, 2]`, the maximum distance is already `6` without needing to swap.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly when the elements are already positioned to maximize the distance.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation
The program fails to correctly compute the maximum possible distance when `1` and `n` are already at the maximum distance. For instance, in the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the maximum distance is `4`, but the code may not reflect this correctly due to the way it calculates `max_dist` and `min_dist`.
