The code `min_pos = a.index(1)` attempts to find the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is populated with distinct integers from user input and the problem states that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, the presence of `1` in the list `a` is a requirement for this operation to succeed. 

Assuming that `1` is indeed present in the list `a`, `min_pos` will be assigned the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`**.
