The value of `dist2` is assigned the result of the expression `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The variable `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The value of `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`. The calculation for `dist2` depends on the specific values of `n` and `max_pos`, but it will always be a non-negative integer since it involves the absolute value function.

Since no specific values for `n` or `max_pos` are provided, we can only describe the output state in terms of the relationships between the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in a; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
