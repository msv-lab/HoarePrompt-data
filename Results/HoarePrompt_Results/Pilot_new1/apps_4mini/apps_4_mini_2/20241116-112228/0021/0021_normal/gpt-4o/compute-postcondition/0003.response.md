The variable `max_pos` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100, and `a` contains distinct integers, the value of `max_pos` will depend on whether `n` is present in the list `a`. If `n` is found in `a`, `max_pos` will hold the index of `n`; if `n` is not found, an error will occur. However, assuming `n` is in the list, the output state will reflect the values of `n`, `a`, and `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`**
