The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers that is a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, subtracting 1 from this distance, and compares it to `n - 2`. It then prints the maximum value between this calculated distance and `n - 1` minus the minimum distance (also calculated as the absolute difference between the positions of 1 and `n` minus 1). The function does not handle cases where the input does not meet the expected format or if the integers are not distinct.
