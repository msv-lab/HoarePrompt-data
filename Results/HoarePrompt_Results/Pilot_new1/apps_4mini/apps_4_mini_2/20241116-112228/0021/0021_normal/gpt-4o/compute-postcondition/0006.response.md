The variable `dist3` is assigned the value `abs(0 - min_pos)`. The previous values of the affected variables are `min_pos`, which is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, without knowing the value of `min_pos`, we cannot determine the exact value of `dist3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in a; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); and `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos) where min_pos is undefined.**
