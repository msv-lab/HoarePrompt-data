To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

1. `min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.
2. The variable `pos1` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown.
3. The variable `posn` is defined as the index of `n` in the list `a`, and since `n` is between 2 and 100, `posn` will be a valid index in the list `a`.
4. The value of `n - 2` will always be a non-negative integer since `n` is at least 2.
5. The calculation involves the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, but since `pos1` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`.

Since `max_dist` is either undefined or dependent on the unknown value of `pos1`, we cannot derive a specific value for `min_dist` without knowing `pos1`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the uncertainty regarding `min_dist` while indicating the known values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `min_dist` is dependent on the unknown value of `pos1`.**
