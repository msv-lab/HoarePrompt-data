The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on their values. However, the specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive).**
