The code assigns the value of `posn` to the index of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input, the value of `posn` will be determined by the position of `n` in the list `a`. However, since we do not know the specific values of `a` or the position of `n` within it, we cannot specify the exact value of `posn`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`.**
