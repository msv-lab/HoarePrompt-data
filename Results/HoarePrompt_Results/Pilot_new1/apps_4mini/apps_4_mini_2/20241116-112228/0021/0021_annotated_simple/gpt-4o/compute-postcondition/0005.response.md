The value of `dist2` is assigned the result of the expression `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (an input integer), and `max_pos` (the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`). The calculation involves taking the absolute value of the difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `n`, `max_pos`, and the calculated value of `dist2`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is an input integer within the specified range, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, and `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
