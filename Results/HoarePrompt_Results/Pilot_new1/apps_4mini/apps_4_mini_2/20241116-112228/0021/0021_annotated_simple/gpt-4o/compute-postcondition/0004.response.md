The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The value of `max_pos` has been defined as the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, `dist1` will be the absolute value of `-max_pos`, which is simply `max_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is an input integer within the specified range, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, and `dist1` is `max_pos`**.
