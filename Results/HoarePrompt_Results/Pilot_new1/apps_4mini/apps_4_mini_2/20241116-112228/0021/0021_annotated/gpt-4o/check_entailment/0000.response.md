To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze both the code and the problem description in detail.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nicholas wants to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions in the array.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of distinct integers.

2. **Finding Positions**:
   - `min_pos = a.index(1)` and `max_pos = a.index(n)` correctly find the positions of the minimum and maximum elements.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distances from both ends of the array (index 0 and index n-1) to the positions of the minimum and maximum elements:
     - `dist1 = abs(0 - max_pos)` (distance from the start to the maximum)
     - `dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)` (distance from the end to the maximum)
     - `dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)` (distance from the start to the minimum)
     - `dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)` (distance from the end to the minimum)

4. **Maximum Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Issues with the Code:
- The code calculates distances from both ends to the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, but it does not consider the effect of performing a swap to actually maximize the distance between the two elements. 
- Specifically, the code does not evaluate whether swapping the minimum with the first or last element, or swapping the maximum with the first or last element, leads to a new configuration that increases the distance between the two.

### Edge Cases:
- For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program will output `4`, which is incorrect because the maximum distance (after a swap) could be `4` (swapping `1` with `5`), but the logic does not account for this effectively.
- Another example is `[2, 1, 3]`, where the expected output after a swap should be `2`, but the program will not yield this correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible distance after performing exactly one swap. It only calculates distances based on the positions of the elements without considering the impact of a swap on the configuration of the array.

Thus, the result is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, particularly in how it handles the swap and the resulting distances.
