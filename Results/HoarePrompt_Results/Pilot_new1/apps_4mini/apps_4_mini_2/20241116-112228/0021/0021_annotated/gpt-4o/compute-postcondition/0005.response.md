To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The initial state provides that:
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
   - `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`.
   - `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`.
   - `dist1` is calculated as `abs(0 - max_pos)`.

2. The code `dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)` calculates `dist2` using the value of `n` and `max_pos`.

3. The value of `dist2` is determined by the formula `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, meaning it computes the absolute difference between the value `n - 1` and `max_pos`.

Since `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, it can take a value from `0` to `n-1`. Thus, the value of `dist2` will depend on the specific values of `n` and `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos); `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
