The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, adjusted for edge cases. The function prints the maximum distance calculated between these two positions, minus one, and the distance from either end of the list. The function does not handle cases where 1 or `n` may not be present in the list, which could lead to a ValueError.
