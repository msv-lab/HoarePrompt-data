The code assigns the value of `dist3` to be the absolute difference between `0` and `min_pos`. The value of `min_pos` was previously defined as the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state includes the values of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, `dist2`, and the newly calculated `dist3`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos); `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos)**
