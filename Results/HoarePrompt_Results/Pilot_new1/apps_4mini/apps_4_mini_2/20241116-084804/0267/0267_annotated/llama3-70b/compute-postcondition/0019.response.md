The operation `dp[n, k] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[n, k]` by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The current values of `dp[n, k]` for different values of `k` are as follows:

- For `k = 1`, `dp[n, k]` is 9.
- For `k = 2`, `dp[n, k]` is 90.
- For `k = 3`, `dp[n, k]` is updated from 90 to a value greater than 90 after two iterations.
- For `k = 4`, `dp[n, k]` is updated further after three iterations.
- For `k = 5`, `dp[n, k]` is updated further after four iterations.
- For `k = 6`, `dp[n, k]` is updated further after five iterations.
- For `k = 7`, `dp[n, k]` is updated further after six iterations.
- For `k = 8`, `dp[n, k]` is updated further after seven iterations.
- For `k = 9`, `dp[n, k]` is updated further after eight iterations.
- For `k = 10`, `dp[n, k]` is updated further after nine iterations.

However, since the value of `MOD` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new values of `dp[n, k]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the current values of `dp[n, k]` without modification.

Output State: **If k is 1, dp[n, k] remains 9. If k is 2, dp[n, k] is 90. If k is 3, dp[n, k] is updated from 90 to a value greater than 90 after two iterations. If k is 4, dp[n, k] is updated further after three iterations. If k is 5, dp[n, k] is updated further after four iterations. If k is 6, dp[n, k] is updated further after five iterations. If k is 7, dp[n, k] is updated further after six iterations. If k is 8, dp[n, k] is updated further after seven iterations. If k is 9, dp[n, k] is updated further after eight iterations. If k is 10, dp[n, k] is updated further after nine iterations.**
