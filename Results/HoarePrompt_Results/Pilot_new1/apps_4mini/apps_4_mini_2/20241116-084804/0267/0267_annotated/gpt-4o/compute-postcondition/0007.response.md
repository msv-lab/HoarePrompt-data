Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r + 1` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is initially 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, reflecting the addition of `num` to the total sum under modulo `MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns False, `total_sum` remains unchanged at 0.***
