Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0. If `k` is between 1 and 10, it checks if the tuple `(n, k)` exists in `dp` and returns the corresponding value if it does. If it does not exist in `dp`, the function calculates a value based on the relationship between `n` and `10^k`, storing the result in `dp[n, k]` before returning it. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than `10^k` and performs specific calculations if `n` is greater than or equal to `10^k`. Additionally, the function includes a modulo operation with `MOD` to ensure the result fits within certain constraints.**
