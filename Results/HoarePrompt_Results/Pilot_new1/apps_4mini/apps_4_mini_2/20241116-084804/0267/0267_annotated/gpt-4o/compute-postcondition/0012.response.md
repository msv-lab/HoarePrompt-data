Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, taken modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. If `l` and `r` are valid integers (1 <= l <= r < 10^18) and `func_1(num, k)` returns false for all `num` in the range, then `total_sum` will also remain 0.**
