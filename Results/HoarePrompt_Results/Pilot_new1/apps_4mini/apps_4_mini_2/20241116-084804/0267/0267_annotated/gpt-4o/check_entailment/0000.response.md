To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the code and its annotations against the requirements stated in the problem.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function checks if the number of unique digits in the integer `n` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - The annotation mentions that it does not handle cases where `k` is negative, but the problem description specifies that `k` is always a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10). Therefore, this point is not a concern for the given problem constraints.

2. **Function `func_2(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function iterates through the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and sums all numbers for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, taking the result modulo `MOD`.
   - The annotation states that if `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. However, the problem guarantees that `l ≤ r`, so this case will not occur with valid inputs.

### Potential Issues:
- The problem requires the calculation of the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits. While the code iterates through all numbers in the specified range and checks the digit condition, it may not be efficient for large ranges (up to \(10^{18}\)) due to the linear iteration. However, the problem does not specify efficiency requirements, only correctness.

### Edge Cases:
- The code does not explicitly handle the case where `l` and `r` are very close to each other (e.g., `l = 1`, `r = 1`) or where all numbers in the range contain more than `k` different digits, leading to a potential `total_sum` of 0. However, this does not violate the correctness as the sum would simply be 0 in such cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as per the problem description. It checks each number in the range `[l, r]` for the number of unique digits, sums those that meet the criteria, and returns the result modulo `998244353`. Since it adheres to the problem requirements without missing any edge cases that would lead to incorrect outputs based on the constraints given, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
