The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `total_sum` is now 0, while `l`, `r`, and `k` retain their respective values.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0**
