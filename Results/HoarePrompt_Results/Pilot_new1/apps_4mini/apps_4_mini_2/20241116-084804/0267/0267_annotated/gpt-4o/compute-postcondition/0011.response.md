According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop will execute for `num` values starting from `l` up to `r`, inclusive. Since `r` is incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, it implies that `num` was equal to `r` during that iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, `num` must be incremented beyond the current `r` value. Therefore, the new `num` must be equal to `r + 1`, and the loop will now execute for this new value. The conditions for `l` and `r` do not change, but we need to adjust the state of `num`.

State: **`l` remains unchanged, `r` is incremented by 1, `num` is equal to `r + 1`**
