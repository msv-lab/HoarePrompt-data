To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
2. The output should be the computed sum modulo `998244353`.

### Code Analysis:
- The function `func_1(l, r, k)` computes the sum by calling the `count` function for the range `[1, r]` and `[1, l-1]` and taking their difference.
- The `count` function is designed to count the numbers that can be formed with at most `k` different digits up to a given number `n`.

### Key Observations:
1. The `count` function has a condition that directly returns `0` if `k` is `0`, which is fine since `k` is constrained to be at least `1`.
2. The logic in `count` for values of `n` less than `10 ** k` seems to imply that it will directly return `n`, which suggests it counts all numbers from `1` to `n` when `n` is small enough.
3. The handling of numbers greater than or equal to `10 ** k` involves more complex calculations, including powers of `10` and the number of digits, but the exact logic is not fully clear without additional context on how those calculations ensure that the digit constraints are respected.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for counting numbers with at most `k` different digits is not explicitly verified against all possible digit combinations, especially for larger numbers.
- The handling of edge cases, such as when `l` and `r` are very close together or when `k` is at its maximum (10), does not seem to be explicitly tested.
- There is no direct summation of valid numbers; instead, the program is only counting how many valid numbers exist, which may not directly lead to the required sum.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not explicitly sum the numbers that meet the criteria and only counts them, it potentially fails to meet the problem's requirement of calculating the sum. For example, if `l = 1`, `r = 20`, and `k = 1`, the valid numbers are `1, 2, ..., 9, 11, 22` which should be summed, but the current implementation does not do this.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is not correctly implemented according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
