According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 1. Given that `l`, `r`, and `n` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, we focus on ensuring that `k` is greater than 1. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 1, which is the first value in the range. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is 1**
