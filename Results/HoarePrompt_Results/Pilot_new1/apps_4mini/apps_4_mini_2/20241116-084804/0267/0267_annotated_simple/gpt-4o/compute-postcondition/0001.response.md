According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if the range from `l` to `r` includes at least one number, which occurs when `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` and `r` are both constrained to be at least 1 and `r` is at most \(10^{18}\), the loop can execute as long as the conditions are met. 

At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0. For the loop to be executed, `num` should start at `l`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `num` will be equal to `l` on the first iteration.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `num` is `l`**
