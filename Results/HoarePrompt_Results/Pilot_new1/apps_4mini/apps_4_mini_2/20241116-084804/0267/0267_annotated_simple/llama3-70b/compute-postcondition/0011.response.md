The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated with the expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` is 9. 

Calculating the new value:
- `i` is 1, so `10 ** (i - 1)` is `10 ** 0` which is 1.
- `k` is greater than 1, but no specific value is given. However, we can denote it as `k`.
- The expression becomes `9 * 1 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.

Thus, the value of `dp[n, k]` becomes:
- `dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.
- Simplifying further, `dp[n, k] = 9 * 10 ** (k - 1)`.

The states of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 9 * 10 ** (k - 1), `i` is 1.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 9 * 10 ** (k - 1), `i` is 1**
