According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0, and the loop variable `num` is currently at the last value it took in the previous iteration, which is `r`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since the loop iterates from `l` to `r + 1`, if `num` is currently `r`, the next iteration would require `num` to be `r + 1`. Therefore, `r` must be adjusted to ensure that `num` can take on the value `r + 1`. 

Thus, to allow for one more iteration of the loop, `l` remains unchanged, and `r` needs to be adjusted to `r` is at least `r + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is unchanged, `r` is at least `r + 1`**
