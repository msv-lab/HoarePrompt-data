The variable `total_sum` is updated with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Given that `total_sum` is initially 0, the new value will depend on the value of `num` and the constant `MOD`. The variable `l` remains unchanged, and `r` is at least `r + 1`, but these do not affect the calculation of `total_sum`. 

Since the exact value of `num` and `MOD` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact new value of `total_sum`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `total_sum` while acknowledging the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to (0 + num) % MOD, `l` is unchanged, `r` is at least `r + 1`**
