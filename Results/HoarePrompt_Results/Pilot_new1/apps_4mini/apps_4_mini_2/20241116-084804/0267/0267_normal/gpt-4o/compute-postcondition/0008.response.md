According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0, `l` is unchanged, and `r` is at least `r + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `num` can take on the next value in the range, which means `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `r` is at least `r + 1`, we can infer that `r` must be adjusted to be exactly equal to `r` (i.e., we need to ensure that `r` is not exceeding its previous value).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we can keep `l` unchanged, `r` needs to be adjusted to `r` (ensuring it is not greater than its previous value), and `num` should be set to `l` to start from the beginning of the range for the next iteration.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is unchanged, `r` is exactly `r`, `num` is `l`**
