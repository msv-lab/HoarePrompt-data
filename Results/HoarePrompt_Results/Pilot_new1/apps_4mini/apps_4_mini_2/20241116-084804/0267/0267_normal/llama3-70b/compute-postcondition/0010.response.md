According to the code, the loop will execute if the range specified in `range(1, k)` contains at least one integer. Since `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than 1, as `range(1, k)` will then include the integer 1 and potentially others up to `k-1`. 

Given the current state, we know that `dp[n, k]` is 9, but this does not affect the execution of the loop. The critical factor is the value of `k`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `k` is greater than 1. Additionally, we need to initialize `i` to be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is 1**
