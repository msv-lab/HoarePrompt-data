Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is between 1 and 10, and if `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation involving the loop for `k` greater than 1, and if `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is set to 9 modulo `MOD`. In all cases, `dp[n, k]` is updated accordingly, and edge cases such as `n` being exactly equal to `10 ** k` are handled by ensuring the correct assignment and calculations are performed.***
