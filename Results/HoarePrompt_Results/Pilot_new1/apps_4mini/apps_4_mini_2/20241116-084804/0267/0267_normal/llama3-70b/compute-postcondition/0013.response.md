The variable `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding a specific calculation based on the values of `i`, `k`, and the power of 10. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` is not specified, but it will be increased by the computed value.

The calculation is as follows:
- `i` is 2
- The term `10 ** (i - 1)` evaluates to `10 ** 1`, which is `10`.
- The term `10 ** (k - i)` is dependent on the value of `k`, which is greater than 1.
- The term `10 ** (i - 1)` is again `10`.
- Therefore, the expression simplifies to `9 + 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2))`.

Thus, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2))`.

Since `dp[n, k]` is modified, but its previous value is unknown, the output state reflects the updated calculation.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2))`**.
