To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over `num` in the range from `l` to `r + 1`. This means that `num` starts at `l` and goes up to `r`, inclusive.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `num` would be `l`, if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, or it would be the last value of `num` processed in the loop if it evaluates to false.
3. To execute the loop one more time, `num` must be incremented by 1 from its last value at the end of the previous iteration.
4. Since `num` is iterating from `l` to `r`, we need to ensure that the new value of `num` does not exceed `r`. 

Given the conditions:
- If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, `total_sum` remains 0, and `num` would be the last value processed.
- If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is set to `(l % MOD)`, but `num` is still equal to `l` at the end of the iteration.

To determine the adjustments:
- If `total_sum` is 0, we need to ensure that the loop can execute again, which means `num` should be incremented.
- If `total_sum` is set to `(l % MOD)`, we need to adjust `num` to be `l + 1` to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments depend on the current state of `num` relative to `r`:

State: **`total_sum` is 0 if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, or `total_sum` is (l % MOD) if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `num` is l + 1, `l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged**
