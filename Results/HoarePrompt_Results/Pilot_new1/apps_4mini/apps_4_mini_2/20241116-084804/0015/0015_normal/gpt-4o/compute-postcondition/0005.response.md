The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is equal to 0, and the output is 'NO'**
