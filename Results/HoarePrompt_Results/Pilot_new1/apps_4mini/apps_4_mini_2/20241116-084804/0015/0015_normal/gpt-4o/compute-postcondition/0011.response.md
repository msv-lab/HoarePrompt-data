Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, the output is 'NO'.***
