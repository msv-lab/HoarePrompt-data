To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the logic based on the problem description and the annotated comments.

### Problem Understanding
The sequence is defined such that:
- The first element is `a`.
- The difference between any two neighboring elements is `c`.
- We need to check if the integer `b` appears in this sequence.

### Key Cases:
1. **If `b` is equal to `a`**: The output should be "YES".
2. **If `c` is 0**: The sequence does not change, meaning all elements are equal to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a`, the output should be "NO".
3. **If `c` is not 0**: We need to check if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. If both conditions are met, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, it should be "NO".

### Analyzing the Code:
```python
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (b == a) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (c == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) :
                print('YES')
            else :
                print('NO')
```

### Evaluation of the Program:
1. **Case where `b == a`**: Correctly outputs "YES".
2. **Case where `c == 0` and `b != a`**: Correctly outputs "NO".
3. **Case where `c != 0`**: 
   - It checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to ensure `b` can be reached by steps of size `c`.
   - It checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that `b` can be reached in a positive number of steps.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **When `a = 1`, `b = 7`, `c = 3`**: The output is "YES" (valid).
- **When `a = 10`, `b = 10`, `c = 0`**: The output is "YES" (valid).
- **When `a = 1`, `b = -4`, `c = 5`**: The output is "NO" (valid).
- **When `a = 0`, `b = 60`, `c = 50`**: The output is "NO" (valid).
- **Testing with `c` being negative**: For example, `a = 10`, `b = 5`, `c = -5` should output "YES" because `b` can be reached by one step of `-5`.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all edge cases correctly as per the problem description. The logic is sound, and all potential cases have been considered.

Correctness: **True**
