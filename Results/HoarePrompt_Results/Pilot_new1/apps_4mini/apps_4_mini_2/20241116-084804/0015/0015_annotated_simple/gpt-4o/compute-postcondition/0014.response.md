The function `func` does not accept any parameters as it is defined without any input variables. Therefore, it does not take any integers `a`, `b`, or `c` as input. Since there is no output provided in the prompt regarding what the function returns, we cannot determine the return value or behavior of the function. Consequently, the functionality of the function cannot be clearly established based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
