The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and no additional calculations or state changes occur. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `c` is not equal to 0; the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`; and the result of `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `c` is not equal to 0; the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`; and the result of `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer.**
