To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step.

The problem requires us to check if a number `b` appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence starting with `a` and having a common difference `c`. The sequence can be represented as:
- `s_1 = a`
- `s_2 = a + c`
- `s_3 = a + 2c`
- ...
- `s_i = a + (i-1)c`

The program checks the following conditions:
1. If `c` is zero, it checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, `b` appears in the sequence (since all terms are `a`), and it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
2. If `c` is not zero, it checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` (which ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding multiples of `c`) and `(b - a) / c >= 0` (which ensures that we are moving in the correct direction towards `b`).

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- When `c` is negative, and `b` is less than `a`, it should return "YES" if `(b - a) % c == 0`, as this indicates that `b` is reachable by subtracting `c` repeatedly from `a`.
- When `c` is positive, and `b` is less than `a`, it should return "NO" since all terms of the sequence will be greater than `a`.

The program fails to handle the case where `c` is negative correctly. For example:
- Input: `10 5 -5`
  - The expected output should be "YES" because the sequence is `10, 5, 0, -5, ...` and `5` is indeed in the sequence. However, the program will evaluate `(b - a) / c` and find that it is not greater than or equal to `0`, hence it will incorrectly print "NO".

Thus, we have found a case where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**.
