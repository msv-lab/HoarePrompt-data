Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when `c` is zero and `a` is not equal to `b`. According to the problem description, when `c` is zero, the sequence does not change from the first element `a`. Therefore, if `a` is not equal to `b`, the output should be "NO". However, the current implementation outputs "NO" correctly in this case.

The issue arises when `c` is zero and `a` is equal to `b`. The program correctly outputs "YES" in this case, which is correct.

However, let's consider the case when `c` is negative. The program does not handle the scenario where the sequence can still include `b` even if `c` is negative. For instance, if we take `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and `c = -5`, the sequence would be `10, 5, 0, -5, ...` and `b` (which is 5) does appear in the sequence, but the program would return "NO" because `(b - a) / c` would yield a negative index.

Thus, the program fails to correctly identify whether `b` is in the sequence for certain inputs, leading to incorrect outputs. 

For example:
Input: `10 5 -5` should return "YES" but the program would output "NO".

Therefore, the implementation is incorrect.
