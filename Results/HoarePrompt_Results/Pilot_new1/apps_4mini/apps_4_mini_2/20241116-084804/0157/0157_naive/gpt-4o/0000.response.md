Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make the compote in the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's how it works:
1. It determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used by taking the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - The number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`).
   - The number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`).
   
   This ensures that the ratio is maintained and that there are enough apples and pears for the number of lemons used.

2. It then calculates the total number of fruits used by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by their respective ratios (1 for lemons, 2 for apples, and 4 for pears).

3. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits that can be used.

The program handles all edge cases described in the problem statement, including the scenario where not enough fruits are available to make any compote, returning 0 in such cases. Thus, it adheres to the requirements of the problem description.
