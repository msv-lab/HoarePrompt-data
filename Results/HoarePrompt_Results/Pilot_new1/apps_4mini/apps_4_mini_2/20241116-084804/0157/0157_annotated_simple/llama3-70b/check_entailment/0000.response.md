To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used in the ratio of 1:2:4. This means for every lemon, there should be exactly 2 apples and 4 pears. 

The program does the following:
1. Reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon`) based on the available fruits:
   - It takes the minimum of:
     - The number of lemons available (`a`).
     - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples.
     - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote as:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of this logic with respect to the problem description. 

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case with insufficient fruits**: If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`, then `min_lemon` would be `min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4)` which results in `0`. The output will be `0`, which is correct since you can't make any compote.
   
2. **Case with exact matching fruits**: If `a = 2`, `b = 4`, and `c = 8`, then `min_lemon` would be `min(2, 4 // 2, 8 // 4)` which results in `2`. The output will be `2 + 4 + 8 = 14`, which is correct.

3. **Case with more fruits than needed**: If `a = 10`, `b = 20`, and `c = 40`, then `min_lemon` would be `min(10, 20 // 2, 40 // 4)` which results in `10`. The output will be `10 + 20 + 40 = 70`, which is also correct.

4. **Case with not enough pears**: If `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, then `min_lemon` would be `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4)` which results in `0`. The output will be `0`, which is correct since you don't have enough pears.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program correctly computes the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratios. The program handles edge cases correctly, including situations where not enough fruits are available to make any compote.

Thus, after analyzing all potential cases and confirming that the program behaves as expected for all inputs within the defined constraints, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
