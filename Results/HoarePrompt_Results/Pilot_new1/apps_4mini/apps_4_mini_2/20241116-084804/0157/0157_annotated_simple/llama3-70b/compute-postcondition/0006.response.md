Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs from the user, representing quantities of different fruits (lemons, apples, and pears). It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients that can be made based on the constraints of using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears per set. The function then calculates the total value based on the number of complete sets, adding the contributions of each type of fruit (1 for lemons, 2 for apples, and 4 for pears) to the final output. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the inputs are non-positive integers, which could lead to incorrect results. **
