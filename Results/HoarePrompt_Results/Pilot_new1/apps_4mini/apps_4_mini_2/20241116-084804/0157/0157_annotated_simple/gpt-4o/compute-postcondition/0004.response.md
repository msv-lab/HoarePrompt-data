To determine the output state, we first analyze the impact of the code on the program.

1. The variable `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This means `max_lemons` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. The line of code calculates `total_fruits` as follows:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`
   - This simplifies to `total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which is `total_fruits = max_lemons * 7`.

3. Other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Given that `max_lemons` is based on the inputs and is a calculated value, we cannot determine its exact value without specific inputs. However, we can express `total_fruits` in terms of `max_lemons`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the relationships between the variables:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**.
