To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state.

1. The initial state defines `min_lemon` as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This means `min_lemon` is the smallest value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`.
2. The code then calculates `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This can be simplified to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which equals `min_lemon * 7`.

Since `min_lemon` is derived from the input integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output state will reflect the relationship between these variables and the calculated result.

Given that `min_lemon` is defined based on the inputs, the output state can be expressed as:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and the result is min_lemon * 7**.
