Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads three integers from input, representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote by taking the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote using the formula:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `total_fruits = max_lemons * 7`.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program handles edge cases correctly:
- If there are not enough pears (or apples) to make even one compote, `max_lemons` will be zero, leading to a total of 0.
- It adheres to the constraints of the problem, ensuring that only whole fruits are counted.

All provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly, and the logic is sound for any valid input within the specified range. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem statement.
