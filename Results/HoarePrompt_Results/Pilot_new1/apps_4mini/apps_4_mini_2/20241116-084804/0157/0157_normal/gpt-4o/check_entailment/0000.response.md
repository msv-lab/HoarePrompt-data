The provided program is designed to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make compote based on the given ratio of lemons, apples, and pears. According to the problem description, for every lemon, there should be exactly 2 apples and 4 pears.

Let's analyze the code:

```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

1. **Logic of the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
   - It calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
     - The number of lemons available (`a`).
     - The number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`).
     - The number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`).
   - It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`.
   - Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem states that if Nikolay doesn't have enough pears, he cannot make any compote. The code correctly calculates `max_lemons` as 0 if there are insufficient pears, apples, or lemons.
   - The inputs are guaranteed to be positive integers (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000), so there are no negative values or zeros to handle.

3. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints confirm that the function calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used and then computes the total number of fruits based on that.
   - The hints also correctly mention that the function does not return any value but only prints the result, which is consistent with the code.

4. **Validation Against Examples**:
   - For the first example (2 lemons, 5 apples, 7 pears), the code computes:
     - `max_lemons = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
     - Total = `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is correct.
   - For the second example (4 lemons, 7 apples, 13 pears):
     - `max_lemons = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
     - Total = `3 + 6 + 12 = 21`, which is also correct.
   - For the third example (2 lemons, 3 apples, 2 pears):
     - `max_lemons = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
     - Total = `0`, which is correct.

Since the code handles all specified cases and adheres to the problem description without missing any edge cases, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
