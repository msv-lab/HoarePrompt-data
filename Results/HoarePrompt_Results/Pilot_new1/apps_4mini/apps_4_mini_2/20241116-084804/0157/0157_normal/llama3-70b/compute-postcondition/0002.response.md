The value of `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a new input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation, and `c` is now updated to the new input integer. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer**
