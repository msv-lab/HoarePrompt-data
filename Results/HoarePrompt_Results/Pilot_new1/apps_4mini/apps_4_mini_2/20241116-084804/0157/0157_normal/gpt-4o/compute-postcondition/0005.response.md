To determine the output state, we analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

The initial state defines:
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer
- `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
- `total_fruits` is calculated as `7 * max_lemons`

The code `print(total_fruits)` outputs the value of `total_fruits`, which is dependent on the previously calculated `max_lemons`.

Since `max_lemons` is defined based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `total_fruits` will be `7 * min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is 7 * max_lemons**
