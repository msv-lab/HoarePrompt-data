Let's analyze the given program based on the problem description and the output hints.

**Problem Description:**
Nikolay has lemons, apples, and pears, and he wants to make a compote using these fruits in the ratio of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears). The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to create the compote, adhering to this ratio.

**Program:**
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

**Analysis of the Code:**
1. The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of the ratio 1:2:4 that can be formed:
   - `min_lemon` is determined by taking the minimum of:
     - The number of lemons available (`a`).
     - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`).
     - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`).
3. The program then computes the total number of fruits used in the compote as:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.
4. Finally, the result is printed.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints state that the function calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients and prints the total. It confirms that the program computes the total correctly based on the calculated `min_lemon`.

**Edge Case Consideration:**
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` are not sufficient to create even one complete set (for example, if `c` is less than 4), `min_lemon` would be `0`, resulting in a total of `0`, which is correct according to the problem description.
- If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all at their minimum values (1 for lemons and apples, and 1 for pears), the program should return `0` since you can't form any complete sets.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the provided ratios. The output hints align with the functionality of the code, and the logic handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

**Correctness: True**.
