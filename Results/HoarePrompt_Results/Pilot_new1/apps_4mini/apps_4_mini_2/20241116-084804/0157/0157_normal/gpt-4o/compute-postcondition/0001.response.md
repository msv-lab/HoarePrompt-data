The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `b` is not known, but it is stated to be a positive integer. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `b` and the status of `a` and `c`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
