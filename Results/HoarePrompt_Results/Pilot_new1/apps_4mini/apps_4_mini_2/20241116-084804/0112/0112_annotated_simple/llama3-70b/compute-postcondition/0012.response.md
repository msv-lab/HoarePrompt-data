The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since `digits` initially contains the string '0', it will be removed from the set. The variable `n` and the contents of `cubes` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `digits` no longer contains '0', `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` contains at least `n` lists of integers.

Output State: **`digits` no longer contains '0'; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` contains at least `n` lists of integers.**
