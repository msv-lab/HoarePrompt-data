Output State: **`digits` is the set of string representations of all integers contained in the lists within `cubes`. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, the loop executes for each list, updating `digits` accordingly. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` contains at least `n` lists of integers.**
