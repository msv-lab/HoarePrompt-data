According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list contains at least one more digit, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` contains at least one more digit. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `digits` list must have at least one more digit than it did at the end of the last iteration.

Since the loop iterates over each `digit` in `digits`, we can adjust the state to reflect that the next digit will be the next in the sequence of `digits`. Thus, we need to ensure that `digits` has at least one more digit, and we can infer that the loop will now be at the next digit.

State: **`used_cubes` is a list of boolean values, `found` is False, and `digits` contains at least one more digit, digit is the next digit in the list**
