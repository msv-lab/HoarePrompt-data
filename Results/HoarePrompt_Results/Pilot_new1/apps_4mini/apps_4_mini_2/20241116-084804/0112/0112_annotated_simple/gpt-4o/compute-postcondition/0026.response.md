The value of `found` is assigned `False`, which is its current value. Since `found` was already `False`, the state of the variable remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values, `found` is False, and `digits` contains at least one more digit.

Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of boolean values, `found` is False, and `digits` contains at least one more digit**
