According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `cubes` must have at least 2 lists, and `cube` should be the second list in `cubes`. Additionally, `digits` should be updated to contain string representations of integers in the new `cube`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`.**
