The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The initial state remains the same, and `found` now explicitly holds the value `False`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, and `found` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, and `found` is False**
