According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 4 lists, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 4 lists, and `cube` should be the fourth list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 4 lists, `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated to include the string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
