The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the element '0' from the set `digits`. Since '0' is an element of `digits` as stated in the initial state, it will be successfully removed. The other variables (`n` and `cubes`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that '0' has been removed from `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` no longer contains '0', `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 0 to 3 lists.**
