According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `digits`. If `digits` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `found` is True, indicating that `digit` was found in one of the `cube_faces`, and the corresponding `used_cubes[i]` was set to True. However, if `n` is less than 1, the loop would not have executed at all, meaning `digits` must have at least one element for the loop to execute again. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `digits` has at least one more element than it had before, and we must also update the state of `found` to reflect that the next `digit` will be processed. 

The exact state adjustments depend on the previous values of `digits` and `found`, but generally, we can say that `digits` should have more elements, and `found` should remain True, since it indicates that a valid `digit` was found.

State: **`found` is True, `digits` has at least one more element**
