The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cubes` containing `n` lists of 6 integers each (ranging from 0 to 9). It returns the largest number that can be formed using the cubes plus 1. If no number can be formed (i.e., if `can_form_number(1)` is false), it returns 0. The function does not check for invalid input cases such as `n` being out of the specified range or the integers in `cubes` not being between 0 and 9.
