The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cube_faces` is a list containing `n` lists, each of which contains 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9. 

After executing the function body, the function has the following behavior based on the input parameters:

- Case 1: If `n` is at least 1 and the `digits` can be matched to the `cube_faces`, the function returns `True`. If any digit cannot be matched to the available `cube_faces`, the function returns `False`. If `n` is 0, or if `digits` is empty, the function would return `True` since there are no digits to match.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and determine if the digits can be matched to the available cube faces, returning `True` if they can and `False` if they cannot. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cube_faces` containing `n` lists of 6 integers each (between 0 and 9), and returns `True` if the digits can be matched to the available cube faces; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
