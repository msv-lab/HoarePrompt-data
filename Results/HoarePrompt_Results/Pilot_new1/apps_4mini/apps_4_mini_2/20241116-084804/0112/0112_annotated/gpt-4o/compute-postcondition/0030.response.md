Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, after the loop executes for each digit in `digits`, `used_cubes` will have some values set to True, indicating which cubes were used to match the digits. If a digit is not found in any of the available `cube_faces`, the function returns False. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged with all values set to False. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function would return True since there are no digits to match. If `n` is at least 1 and there are digits present but none can be matched to the `cube_faces`, the function returns False, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged.**
