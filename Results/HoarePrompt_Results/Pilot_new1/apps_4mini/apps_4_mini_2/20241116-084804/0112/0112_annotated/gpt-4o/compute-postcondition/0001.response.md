The code initializes `used_cubes` as a list of boolean values, all set to `False`, with a length of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` will contain either 1, 2, or 3 elements, all set to `False`. The other variables (`cube_faces` and `digits`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9; `digits` is a list of the digits of `num` as a string; `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, all set to False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9; `digits` is a list of the digits of `num` as a string; `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, all set to False**
