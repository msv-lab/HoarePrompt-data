The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `n` is now equal to the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `n` is now equal to the input integer**
