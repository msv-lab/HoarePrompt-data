Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all integers found in the lists contained in `cubes`. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. If `n` is 1, the loop executes once; if `n` is 2, it executes twice; if `n` is 3, it executes three times. In all cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers.**
