Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, the loop iterates over the range of `n`. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` stays False. After the loop, if `found` is still False, it indicates that `digit` was not found in any of the available `cube_faces`.**
