The variable `cubes` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The outer list comprehension runs `n` times, which can be 1, 2, or 3. The exact values of the inner lists will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values for `n` and the structure of `cubes` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, each created from input values.**
