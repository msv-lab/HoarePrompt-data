According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. The other variables (`cube_faces`, `digits`, `digit`, and `found`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself but provide context for the loop body.

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
- `n` must be in the range of 1 to 3 (which it is).
- `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list of at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the digits list, `found` is False**
