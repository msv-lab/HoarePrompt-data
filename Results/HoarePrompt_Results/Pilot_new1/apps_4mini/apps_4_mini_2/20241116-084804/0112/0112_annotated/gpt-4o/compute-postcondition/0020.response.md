According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `n` is greater than 1, it ensures that the loop can potentially execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted based on the information provided.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, and `digit` is the third digit in the `digits` list (if available)**
