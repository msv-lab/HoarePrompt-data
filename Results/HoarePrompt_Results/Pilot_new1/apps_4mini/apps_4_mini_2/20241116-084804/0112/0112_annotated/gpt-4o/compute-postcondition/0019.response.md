Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, and `digit` is the third digit in the `digits` list (if available). If `used_cubes[2]` is `False` and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `used_cubes[2]` remains unchanged, and `found` remains unchanged.***
