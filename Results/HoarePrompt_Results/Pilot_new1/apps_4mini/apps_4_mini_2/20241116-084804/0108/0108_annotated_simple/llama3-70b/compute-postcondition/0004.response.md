The code appends the value of `char`, which is 'a', to `res`. Since `res` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `res` will contain the string 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
