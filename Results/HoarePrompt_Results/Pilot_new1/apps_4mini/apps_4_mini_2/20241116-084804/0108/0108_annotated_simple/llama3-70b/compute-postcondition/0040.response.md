Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of characters from the original `s` that were replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and the length of `res` is less than 26. The original string `s` remains unchanged or contains characters beyond 'z', and if `s` contains lowercase letters, not all of them were processed. If `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, `res` is an empty string.***
