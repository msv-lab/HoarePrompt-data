The value of `res` is updated to include `char`, which means `char` is appended to the existing value of `res`. The state of `s` remains unchanged, but it still contains at least one occurrence of `char`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` and the unchanged state of `s`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, `s` still contains at least one occurrence of `char`**
