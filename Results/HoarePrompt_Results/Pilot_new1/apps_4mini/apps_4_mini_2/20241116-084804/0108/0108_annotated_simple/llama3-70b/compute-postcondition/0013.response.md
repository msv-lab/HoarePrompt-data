Output State: **`if s contains any lowercase letters then res` is a string consisting of the characters from `s` that are sequentially replaced by the next character in the alphabet, starting from 'a'. The final value of `s` will be the original string with all instances of 'a' replaced by the next characters in the sequence until no 'a' or the next character exists. If `s` does not contain 'a', the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty string. At the end, `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the last character found in `s` or 'z' if it has been incremented through all characters.**
