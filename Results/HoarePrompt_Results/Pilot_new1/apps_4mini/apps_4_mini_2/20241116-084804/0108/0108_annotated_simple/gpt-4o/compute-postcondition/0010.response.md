Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. Thus, `j` can be either 1 or 2 if the condition is satisfied, or it remains 0 or 1 if the condition is not satisfied.***
