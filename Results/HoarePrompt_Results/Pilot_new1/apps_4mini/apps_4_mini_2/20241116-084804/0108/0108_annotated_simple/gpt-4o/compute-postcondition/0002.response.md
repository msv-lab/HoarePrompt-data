The variable `target_len` is assigned the value of `len(target)`, which calculates the length of the string `target`. The string `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which has a length of 26. The variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26**
