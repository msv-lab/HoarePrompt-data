The code assigns the values 0 to both `i` and `j`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are not specified, but they are initialized to 0. The states of the other variables (`s`, `target`, and `target_len`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
