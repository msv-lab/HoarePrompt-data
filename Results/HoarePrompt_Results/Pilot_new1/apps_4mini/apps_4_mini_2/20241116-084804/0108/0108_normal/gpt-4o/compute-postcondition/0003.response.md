The code initializes two variables `i` and `j` to 0. The previous values of `s`, `target`, and `target_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `i` and `j` while keeping the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of the user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
