The code attempts to print the variable `target`, but `target` has not been defined in the initial state or in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects that `target` is not defined. The values of `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, `j` is 26, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, and `target` is not defined**.
