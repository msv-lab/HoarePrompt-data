Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a string `s` from the input. It checks if `s` contains all the letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z') in order. If `s` contains all these characters in order, it prints the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` is empty or does not have at least 26 characters, the function will also print -1. **
