The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` can be either 0 or 1, after the execution, `j` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables `s`, `i`, and `target_len` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of user input with a length greater than 1; `j` is either 1 or 2; `i` is increased by 1; `target_len` is greater than `j`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of user input with a length greater than 1; `j` is either 1 or 2; `i` is increased by 1; `target_len` is greater than `j`**
