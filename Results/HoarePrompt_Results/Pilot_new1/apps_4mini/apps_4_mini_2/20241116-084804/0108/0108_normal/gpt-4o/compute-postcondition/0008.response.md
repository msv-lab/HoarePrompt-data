According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `s`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `target_len` is 26. For the loop to execute one more time:

1. `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `i` is currently 1, `len(s)` must be greater than 1.
2. `j` must be less than `target_len`. Since `j` is currently 0 and `target_len` is 26, this condition is satisfied.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of user input and len(s) is greater than 1, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
