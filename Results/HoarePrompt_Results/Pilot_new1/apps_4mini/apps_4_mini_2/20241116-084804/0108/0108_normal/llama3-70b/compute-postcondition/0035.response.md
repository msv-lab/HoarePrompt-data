Output State: **`if char is present in s then res` is a repeated string of 'a' for each occurrence of 'a' in `s` plus one 'c' for each occurrence of 'c' in `s`, `s` will have all occurrences of 'char' replaced with the next character in the alphabet until `char` is no longer in `s`; at the end of the loop, `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the last character processed. If `char` is not present in `s` at the beginning, the loop does not execute and `res` remains unchanged.**
