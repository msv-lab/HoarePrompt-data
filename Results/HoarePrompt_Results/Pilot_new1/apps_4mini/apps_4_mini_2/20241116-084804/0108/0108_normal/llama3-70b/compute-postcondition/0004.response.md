The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. Since `res` is initially an empty string and `char` is 'a', after execution, `res` becomes 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a new input string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is a new input string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
