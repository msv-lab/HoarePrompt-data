Output State: **`if s contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then j is 26 and i is the length of s. if s does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then j is less than 26 and i is the length of s. If s is empty or does not contain any letters, the loop does not execute and i remains 0 while j remains 0.`**
