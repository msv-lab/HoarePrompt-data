The code prints the value of `res`, which is a string containing all characters from 'a' to 'z'. The variable `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the printed result.

Output State: **`res` is a string containing all characters from 'a' to 'z', `s` is an empty string, and the function prints `res`.**
