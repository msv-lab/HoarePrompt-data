Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it contains all the letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. If it does, it attempts to print the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `s` does not contain all letters in order, it prints -1. However, the function will raise an error because it tries to print `target`, which is not defined in the code. Additionally, if `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function will also produce no output. **
