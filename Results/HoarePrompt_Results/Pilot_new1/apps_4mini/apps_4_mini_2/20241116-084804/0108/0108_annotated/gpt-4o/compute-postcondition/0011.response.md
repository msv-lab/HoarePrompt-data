The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; and `j` is less than 26.
