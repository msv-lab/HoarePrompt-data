Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program correctly normalizes the input angle and calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical. The original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness based on the problem description. The program handles both positive and negative angles correctly and provides the minimal number of turns as required. The annotations further confirm the correctness of the approach taken by the program.
