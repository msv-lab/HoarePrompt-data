Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Normalization of Angle**: 
   - The program normalizes the angle using `normalized_angle = x % 360`. This is generally correct for angles within one full rotation (0 to 360 degrees). However, the problem description allows angles from \(-10^{18}\) to \(10^{18}\) degrees. The modulo operation with 360 does not handle large negative values properly, as it will always yield a positive remainder.

2. **Handling Negative Angles**:
   - For negative angles, the modulo operation alone does not give the correct minimum deviation. For example, if \(x = -60\), the modulo operation gives \(300\), but the correct normalized angle considering the direction of rotation should be \(300 - 360 = -60\) (or equivalently, \(300 - 360 + 360 = 300 - 360 = -60\)). The program should account for this by converting negative results to the range \([0, 360)\).

3. **Calculation of Minimum Turns**:
   - The formula `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not correctly handle all cases, especially for negative angles. It calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical but does not consider the direction of rotation accurately.

### Correct Solution Approach:

To correctly handle the problem, the angle needs to be normalized to the range \([0, 360)\) and then the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns should be calculated. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    # Normalize the angle to the range [0, 360)
    normalized_angle = (x % 360 + 360) % 360
    # Calculate the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns
    turns = (4 - (normalized_angle // 90)) % 4
    print(turns)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Normalization**:
   - `(x % 360 + 360) % 360` ensures that the angle is correctly normalized to the range \([0, 360)\). This handles both positive and negative angles correctly.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Turns**:
   - `normalized_angle // 90` gives the number of 90-degree intervals the angle spans.
   - `4 - (normalized_angle // 90)` gives the number of additional 90-degree turns needed to reach the nearest multiple of 90.
   - Taking the result modulo 4 ensures the result is within the range \([0, 3)\), which is the number of 90-degree turns needed.

This approach correctly handles all cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
