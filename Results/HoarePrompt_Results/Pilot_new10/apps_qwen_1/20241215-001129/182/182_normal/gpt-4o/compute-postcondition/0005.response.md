Let's break down the annotated code and return postconditions step by step:

1. **Input**: The function starts by taking an integer input `x` within the range \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\).
2. **Normalization**: The variable `normalized_angle` is assigned the value of `x % 360`, which normalizes the angle `x` to a range between 0 and 359 degrees.
3. **Calculating Turns**: The variable `turns` is calculated as `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. This calculation determines the number of turns required to align with a specific direction based on the normalized angle.
4. **Output**: The result stored in `turns` is printed.

Given the return postconditions, we need to focus on what the function actually does. Here’s the analysis:

- The function takes no parameters explicitly, but it reads an integer `x` from the user.
- The function normalizes the input angle `x` to a value between 0 and 359 degrees.
- Based on the normalized angle, it calculates the number of 90-degree turns required to reach a specific orientation.
- Finally, it prints the number of turns.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and ensure we cover all possibilities:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `x` is exactly 0, `normalized_angle` will be 0.
  - If `x` is a multiple of 360, `normalized_angle` will also be 0.
  - If `x` is outside the range \(-10^{18} \leq x \leq 10^{18}\), the function will still read the input but the behavior is undefined because the range is not enforced in the code.
  - If `x` is a large positive or negative number, the modulo operation will still work correctly to normalize the angle.

Given these points, the function’s primary functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `x` from the user, normalizes the angle to a range between 0 and 359 degrees, calculates the number of 90-degree turns required to align with a specific orientation, and prints the result.**
