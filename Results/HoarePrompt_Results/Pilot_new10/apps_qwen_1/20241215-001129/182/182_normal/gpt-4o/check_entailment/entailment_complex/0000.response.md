Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `x` from the user, which represents the camera's rotation angle in degrees. This is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Normalization of Angle**: The program uses `normalized_angle = x % 360` to normalize the angle to a range between 0 and 359 degrees. This ensures that the angle is within a manageable range for further calculations.

3. **Calculating Turns**: The program calculates the number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from the vertical. It does this by using the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4`. Here’s the reasoning behind this formula:
   - `(360 - normalized_angle)` gives the remaining degrees to complete a full 360-degree rotation from the current angle.
   - Dividing by 90 gives the number of 90-degree turns needed.
   - Taking `% 4` ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to 3, which corresponds to 0, 1, 2, and 3 turns respectively.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated number of turns, which is the required output according to the problem statement.

The program handles both positive and negative angles correctly due to the normalization step (`x % 360`). For example:
- If the input is 60 degrees (clockwise), the normalized angle is 60, and the turns required are `(360 - 60) // 90 % 4 = 3`.
- If the input is -60 degrees (counter-clockwise), the normalized angle is 300 (since -60 % 360 = 300), and the turns required are `(360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 1`.

Thus, the program always meets the requirements specified in the problem description for any valid input within the given range.
