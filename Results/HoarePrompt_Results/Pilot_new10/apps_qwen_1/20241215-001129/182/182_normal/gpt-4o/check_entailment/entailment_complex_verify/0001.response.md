Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The annotated code clearly explains each step of the process, confirming that the program correctly normalizes the angle and calculates the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. The logic used in the code aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description, and the annotated version supports this understanding. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment was inaccurate.
