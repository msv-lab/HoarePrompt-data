Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly determines the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns required to minimize the deviation of the image from the vertical. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Normalization**: The code normalizes the angle `x` to a range between 0 and 359 degrees using `normalized_angle = x % 360`. This ensures that the angle wraps around correctly.

2. **Calculating Turns**: The code calculates the number of 90-degree turns needed to align the image with a specific orientation. It uses the formula `(360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` to determine the minimum number of turns. This formula works for both positive and negative angles:
   - For a positive angle `x` (clockwise rotation), the formula calculates how many 90-degree turns are needed to reach the closest multiple of 360 degrees minus the current angle.
   - For a negative angle `x` (counter-clockwise rotation), the formula calculates the equivalent positive angle and then determines the turns.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases correctly:
   - If the normalized angle is already a multiple of 90 degrees, no turns are needed.
   - If the angle is close to 360 degrees (e.g., 359 degrees), the formula correctly calculates the minimal number of turns to align the image.

Given the examples and the problem description, the code works correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
