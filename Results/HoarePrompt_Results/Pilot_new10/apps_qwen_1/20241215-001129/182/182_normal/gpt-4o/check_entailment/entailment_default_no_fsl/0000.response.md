Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the negative values for the camera rotation angle. For negative angles (counter-clockwise rotation), the code calculates the number of turns incorrectly. 

For example, if the input is `-60`, the code calculates the normalized angle as follows:
\[ \text{normalized\_angle} = -60 \mod 360 = 300 \]
Then it calculates the number of turns as:
\[ \text{turns} = (360 - 300) // 90 \% 4 = 60 // 90 \% 4 = 0 \]
This results in an output of `0`, which is incorrect. The correct number of turns for `-60` should be `3`, as explained in the problem description.

To fix this, the code should correctly handle negative angles by converting them to positive angles within the range of 0 to 359 degrees before performing the calculations. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = abs(x) % 360
    turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4
    print(turns)
```

This corrected code will correctly handle both positive and negative angles, ensuring the program works for every potential case as specified in the problem description.
