The code `x = x % 360` calculates the remainder when `x` is divided by 360 and assigns this remainder back to `x`. The value of `x` is now within the range [0, 359] if it was originally outside this range. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is the integer entered by the user modulo 360 (i.e., x is in the range 0 to 359)**
