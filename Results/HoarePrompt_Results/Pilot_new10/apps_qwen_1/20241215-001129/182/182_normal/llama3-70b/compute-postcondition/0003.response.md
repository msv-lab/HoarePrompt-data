The code prints the integer `0`. Since printing does not assign the printed value back to any variable, the only change is that the integer `0` is displayed on the screen. The value of `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 359, and the current value of `x` is 0; 0 is printed on the screen.**
