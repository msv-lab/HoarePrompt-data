Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment suggests that the program correctly determines the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical for both positive and negative rotation angles. However, upon closer inspection, the program only handles angles within the range [0, 359] correctly. When the input angle `x` is negative, the program's logic does not account for the full range of possible angles after normalization. Specifically, the formula `(x + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` does not handle the full range of negative angles properly. 

For example, if the input is `-60`, the program should return `3`, but it returns `1`. This is because `-60 % 360` is `300`, and `(300 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4` evaluates to `1`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `3` turns, as explained in the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program needs to be revised to handle negative angles correctly.
