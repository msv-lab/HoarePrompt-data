Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of 90-degree clockwise turns needed to minimize the deviation from vertical. Specifically, the code calculates the modulo 360 of the input angle, which is a step in the right direction, but it does not properly account for all possible cases.

For example, consider the following inputs:

- For an input of `270`, the reduced value is `270 % 360 = 270`. The code then computes `(270 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4 = 3`, which suggests 3 turns are needed. However, 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and the optimal solution would be to perform 1 turn (90 degrees clockwise).

- For an input of `-270`, the reduced value is `(-270) % 360 = 90`. The code then computes `(90 + 90 - 1) // 90 % 4 = 2`, which suggests 2 turns are needed. However, -270 degrees (or 90 degrees counter-clockwise) would require only 1 turn (90 degrees clockwise).

To fix this, the code should correctly map the reduced angle to the closest multiple of 90 degrees, ensuring the minimum number of turns is computed. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    x = x % 360
    # Determine the minimum number of 90-degree turns
    min_turns = (x // 90) % 4
    if x % 90 <= 45:
        min_turns = (min_turns - 1) % 4
    print(min_turns)
```

This version ensures that the angle is correctly mapped to the closest multiple of 90 degrees, minimizing the number of turns.
