Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the function \( f(i) \) as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the number of distinct integers reachable, but it does not handle the constraint that the frog cannot jump outside the interval \([0, i]\). 

For example, consider the input \( m = 1 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 3 \). According to the problem, \( f(1) \) should be 1 because the only reachable positions from 0 within the interval \([0, 1]\) are \{0\}. However, the program will incorrectly update the DP table and produce a value greater than 1 for \( f(1) \).

To verify this, let's manually calculate \( f(1) \) for the given example:

- Starting from 0, the frog can jump to 5 (but 5 is out of the interval \([0, 1]\)), so no valid jumps are possible within the interval \([0, 1]\).
- Therefore, \( f(1) = 1 \).

However, the program will add contributions from both \( i + a \) and \( i - b \) for \( i = 0 \), leading to an incorrect result. This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the constraints of the problem.
