The function accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`.
