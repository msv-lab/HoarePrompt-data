Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, consider the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1) and \(m\) is a large number such that \(m \geq a + b - 1\). The code correctly handles this case by calculating the sum of the first \(m\) natural numbers minus the sum of the first \(a + b - 2\) natural numbers, plus the triangular number for \(a + b - 1\).

However, the issue arises when \(a\) and \(b\) are not coprime. In such cases, the frog's reachable positions are restricted to multiples of the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\). The code correctly handles this by recursively dividing \(m\), \(a\), and \(b\) by their GCD until they become coprime, then applying the formula. However, the code does not correctly account for the fact that the reachable positions are multiples of the GCD.

For example, consider the input \(m = 10\), \(a = 2\), and \(b = 4\). The GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is 2. The reachable positions are multiples of 2 up to 10, which are \(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\). There are 6 such positions. The code would incorrectly calculate the sum as if \(a\) and \(b\) were coprime, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the code does not handle the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are not coprime, making it incorrect for the given problem description.
