The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `m + 1`. This means that each element in the list `dp` from index 0 to index `m` is set to 0. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\); `a` is an integer where \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\); `b` is an integer where \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\); `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0.**
