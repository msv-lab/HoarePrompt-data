You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program has a logical issue. Specifically, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of distinct integers the frog can reach up to each position `i`. However, the program incorrectly updates the `dp` array, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 4 5
```

The expected output for this case is `10`, but the program outputs `12`.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

- For `m = 6`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`:
  - `dp[0]` is initialized to 1.
  - For `i = 0`:
    - `dp[4]` is incremented by `dp[0]` (becomes 1).
    - `dp[0]` remains 1.
  - For `i = 1`:
    - `dp[5]` is incremented by `dp[1]` (becomes 1 since `dp[1]` is initially 0).
    - `dp[1]` remains 0.
  - For `i = 2`:
    - `dp[6]` is incremented by `dp[2]` (becomes 1 since `dp[2]` is initially 0).
    - `dp[2]` remains 0.
  - For `i = 3`:
    - `dp[7]` is incremented by `dp[3]` (becomes 1 since `dp[3]` is initially 0).
    - `dp[3]` remains 0.
  - For `i = 4`:
    - `dp[8]` is incremented by `dp[4]` (becomes 1 since `dp[4]` is 1).
    - `dp[0]` is incremented by `dp[4]` (becomes 2).
  - For `i = 5`:
    - `dp[9]` is incremented by `dp[5]` (becomes 1 since `dp[5]` is 1).
    - `dp[1]` is incremented by `dp[5]` (becomes 1).
  - For `i = 6`:
    - `dp[10]` is incremented by `dp[6]` (becomes 1 since `dp[6]` is 1).
    - `dp[2]` is incremented by `dp[6]` (becomes 1).
    - `dp[1]` is incremented by `dp[6]` (becomes 2).
  - For `i = 7`:
    - `dp[11]` is incremented by `dp[7]` (becomes 1 since `dp[7]` is 1).
    - `dp[3]` is incremented by `dp[7]` (becomes 1).
    - `dp[2]` is incremented by `dp[7]` (becomes 2).

After computing `dp` values, the sum of `dp` array is 12, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 10 based on the expected output.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the updates and ensure that the `dp` array is updated properly for each position.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads three integers \( m \), \( a \), and \( b \) from the input, constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` of size \( m + 1 \), and prints the sum of all elements in `dp` after filling it based on the values of \( a \) and \( b \). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
