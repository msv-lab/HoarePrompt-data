To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the structure of the for loop:

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = m`.

2. **Variables Involved**: The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `m`, inclusive.

3. **Initial States**:
   - `m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\).
   - `a` is an integer where \(1 \leq a \leq 10^5\).
   - `b` is an integer where \(1 \leq b \leq 10^5\).
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and all other elements are `0`.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

Given these points, the key variables that need to be considered are `i` and `m`. The loop will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` until `i` reaches `m`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- The initial value of `i` should be set to `0`.
- The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` should be within the range `[0, m]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`i` is 0, `m` is an integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\)**
