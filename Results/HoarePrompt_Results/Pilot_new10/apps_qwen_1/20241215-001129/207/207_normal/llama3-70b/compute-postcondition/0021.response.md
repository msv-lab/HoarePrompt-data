The code `print(sum(dp))` calculates the sum of the elements in the list `dp` and prints it. However, the initial state does not provide any specific values for `dp`. Therefore, after executing this line of code, the value of `dp` is summed up and printed, but no specific values are known for the elements of `dp`.

Output State: **`dp` is a list, its elements are summed up and printed**
