Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach. Specifically, the way the `dp` array is updated leads to incorrect results. The output hints also confirm that the program constructs a dynamic programming array and sums its elements, but the logic used to fill the `dp` array is flawed. This can be seen from the example provided, where the expected output is 10, but the program outputs 12. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is correct.
