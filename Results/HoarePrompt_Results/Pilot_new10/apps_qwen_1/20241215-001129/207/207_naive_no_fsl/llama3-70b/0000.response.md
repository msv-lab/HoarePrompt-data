Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program has a logical issue. Specifically, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of distinct integers the frog can reach up to each position `i`. However, the program incorrectly updates the `dp` array, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 4 5
```

The expected output for this case is `10`, but the program outputs `12`.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

- For `m = 6`, `a = 4`, and `b = 5`:
  - `dp[0]` is initialized to 1.
  - For `i = 0`:
    - `dp[4]` is incremented by `dp[0]` (becomes 1).
    - `dp[0]` remains 1.
  - For `i = 1`:
    - `dp[5]` is incremented by `dp[1]` (becomes 1 since `dp[1]` is initially 0).
    - `dp[1]` remains 0.
  - For `i = 2`:
    - `dp[6]` is incremented by `dp[2]` (becomes 1 since `dp[2]` is initially 0).
    - `dp[2]` remains 0.
  - For `i = 3`:
    - `dp[7]` is incremented by `dp[3]` (becomes 1 since `dp[3]` is initially 0).
    - `dp[3]` remains 0.
  - For `i = 4`:
    - `dp[8]` is incremented by `dp[4]` (becomes 1 since `dp[4]` is 1).
    - `dp[0]` is incremented by `dp[4]` (becomes 2).
  - For `i = 5`:
    - `dp[9]` is incremented by `dp[5]` (becomes 1 since `dp[5]` is 1).
    - `dp[1]` is incremented by `dp[5]` (becomes 1).
  - For `i = 6`:
    - `dp[10]` is incremented by `dp[6]` (becomes 1 since `dp[6]` is 1).
    - `dp[2]` is incremented by `dp[6]` (becomes 1).
    - `dp[1]` is incremented by `dp[6]` (becomes 2).
  - For `i = 7`:
    - `dp[11]` is incremented by `dp[7]` (becomes 1 since `dp[7]` is 1).
    - `dp[3]` is incremented by `dp[7]` (becomes 1).
    - `dp[2]` is incremented by `dp[7]` (becomes 2).

After computing `dp` values, the sum of `dp` array is 12, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 10 based on the expected output.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the updates and ensure that the `dp` array is updated properly for each position.
