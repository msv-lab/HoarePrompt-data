Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`, but it fails to consider all possible reachable positions within the interval `[0, x]`.

### Example Case:
Consider the input `m = 6, a = 4, b = 5`. According to the problem description, we need to calculate the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `6`.

- `f(0) = 1` (starting point)
- `f(1) = 1` (cannot reach 1 directly)
- `f(2) = 1` (cannot reach 2 directly)
- `f(3) = 1` (cannot reach 3 directly)
- `f(4) = 3` (can reach 4, 8, and 9 from 4)
- `f(5) = 3` (can reach 5, 9, and 10 from 5)
- `f(6) = 6` (can reach 6, 10, 14, 15, 16, and 17 from 6)

Summing these values gives us `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 15`.

However, the provided program outputs `10`, which is incorrect.

### Reasoning:
The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the problem, but it does not correctly handle the reachable positions within the interval `[0, x]` for all cases. Specifically, it incorrectly simplifies the problem and does not account for all possible reachable positions, leading to an incorrect result in certain cases.

Thus, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
