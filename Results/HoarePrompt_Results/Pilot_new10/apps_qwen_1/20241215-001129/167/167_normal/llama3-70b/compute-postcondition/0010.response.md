Postcondition: ***`nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\), `v` is the next value from the list `a`, `y` is a specific integer, `px` is \((v - 1) // y\), `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\). If the sum of the absolute differences between `nx` and `px` and between `ny` and `py` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, no specific action is taken (the values remain unchanged).***
