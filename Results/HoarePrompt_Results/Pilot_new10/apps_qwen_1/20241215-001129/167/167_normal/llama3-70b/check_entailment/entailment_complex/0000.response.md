Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of cells visited `n` and the sequence of integers `a` from the input, which is handled correctly.

2. **Range Check**: The program iterates over all possible values of `x` and `y` up to \(10^9\) to check if they satisfy the conditions. It breaks the loop early if the product `x * y` exceeds the maximum value in the sequence `a`, ensuring efficiency.

3. **Value Range Check**: Before calling `func_1`, the program ensures that all values in `a` are within the range `[1, x * y]`. This is a necessary condition for the sequence to be valid.

4. **Path Validation Function (`func_1`)**: 
   - The function initializes the starting position of the path at `(0, 0)` and iterates through each value `v` in the sequence `a`.
   - For each value `v`, it calculates the corresponding position `(nx, ny)` in the matrix using the formula `(v - 1) // y` and `(v - 1) % y`.
   - It checks if the absolute difference between the current position and the previous position is exactly 1, indicating a valid move to an adjacent cell.
   - If any move is invalid, the function returns `False`.
   - If all moves are valid, the function returns `True`.

5. **Output Handling**: If a valid pair `(x, y)` is found, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and exits. If no valid pair is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It ensures that the sequence of integers forms a valid path on a grid and checks the constraints efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.
