The code initializes two variables `px` and `py` to 0. This does not affect the values of `x` and `y` from the initial state, nor does it change the list of integers.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 <= y <= 10^9, and a list of integers numbers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n, representing the sequence of integers in the cells visited on the path; `px` is 0, `py` is 0.**
