The code assigns the values of `(v - 1) // y` to `nx` and `(v - 1) % y` to `ny`. The variables `v` and `y` are used in these assignments, and `nx` and `ny` are updated based on these calculations. The variables `px` and `py` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the assignment. 

Given the initial state:
- `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\)
- `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\)
- `v` is the next value from the list `a`
- `y` is a specific integer
- `px` is \((v - 1) // y\)
- `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\)

After executing the code:
- `nx` is now assigned the value \((v - 1) // y\)
- `ny` is now assigned the value \((v - 1) \% y\)

Since the values of `v` and `y` are the same as before the assignment, the expressions for `px` and `py` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\), `v` is the next value from the list `a`, `y` is a specific integer, `px` is \((v - 1) // y\), `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\)**
