Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

1. **Matrix Generation and Validation**:
   - The matrix is generated based on the formula \(A_{i,j} = y(i-1) + j\). However, since the actual generation of the matrix is not required, the program checks if all elements in `a` lie within the range \([1, xy]\) and if the values match the positions derived from the given \(x\) and \(y\).
   
2. **Path Validation**:
   - The `func_1` function validates whether the given sequence of moves (`a`) is valid. It ensures that each move between two consecutive cells is exactly one step horizontally or vertically. This is done by calculating the Manhattan distance between the current position and the next position based on the values in `a`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is sound because it correctly checks if the difference in row and column indices between consecutive cells is exactly 1 (either in the horizontal or vertical direction).

3. **Loop Boundaries**:
   - The loops for checking different values of \(x\) and \(y\) are bounded by 1 to \(10^9\), which matches the constraints specified in the problem description.
   - The program breaks out of the loop early if \(x \times y\) exceeds the maximum value in `a`, ensuring efficiency.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the dimensions \(x\) and \(y\) if a valid solution is found. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This output format matches the requirement in the problem statement.

Since the program checks all necessary conditions and outputs the correct result based on the problem description, it is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
