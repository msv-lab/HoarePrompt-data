Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `nx` is \((v - 1) // y\)
   - `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\)
   - `v` is a specific integer
   - `y` is a specific integer
   - `px` is \((v - 1) // y\)
   - `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\)

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for v in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - The variable `v` takes on each value from the list `a`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was the specific integer used in the previous computation.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must take the next value from the list `a`.

5. **Updating the States**:
   - `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on the new value of `v` (the next element in `a`).
   - `px` and `py` will be the same as `nx` and `ny` since they are derived from the same formula.

6. **Final State**:
   - `v` will now be the next value from the list `a`.
   - `nx` will be \((v - 1) // y\)
   - `ny` will be \((v - 1) \% y\)
   - `px` and `py` will be the same as the new `nx` and `ny`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\), `v` is the next value from the list `a`, `y` is a specific integer, `px` is \((v - 1) // y\), `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\)**
