The code assigns the values of `nx` and `ny` to `px` and `py` respectively. This means that `px` now holds the value of `nx`, and `py` now holds the value of `ny`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\), `v` is the next value from the list `a`, `y` is a specific integer, `px` is \((v - 1) // y\), `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\); `px` is `nx`, `py` is `ny`.**
