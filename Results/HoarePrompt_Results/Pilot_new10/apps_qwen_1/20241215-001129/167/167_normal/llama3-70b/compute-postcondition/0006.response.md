The code `px, py = nx, ny` assigns the value of `nx` to `px` and the value of `ny` to `py`. This means that `px` and `py` will now hold the same values as `nx` and `ny` respectively. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `v`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is \((v - 1) // y\), `ny` is \((v - 1) \% y\), `v` is a specific integer, `y` is a specific integer, `px` is \((v - 1) // y\), `py` is \((v - 1) \% y\)**
