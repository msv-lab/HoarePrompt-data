The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100. The string may contain the following vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. 

If no vowel is found in the string `s`, `prev_pos` will be -1. The function calculates `max_jump` as the maximum value between its original value (which is not specified but can be considered as 0 for this context) and `i - prev_pos`, where `i` is the length of `s` and `prev_pos` is the last index where a vowel was found in the string `s`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return the value of `max_jump` based on the described calculation.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, returns `max_jump` which is the maximum value between its original value and `len(s) - prev_pos`, where `prev_pos` is the last index where a vowel was found in the string `s`.**
