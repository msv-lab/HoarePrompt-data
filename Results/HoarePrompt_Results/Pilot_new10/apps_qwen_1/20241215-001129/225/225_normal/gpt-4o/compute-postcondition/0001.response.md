The code `max_jump = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `max_jump`. The initial state of `s` and `vowels` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is a set containing {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1**
