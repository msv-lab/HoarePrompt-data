Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided code calculates the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string, which does not meet the requirement of finding the minimum jump ability needed to jump only on vowels and reach the far end of the string. The code does not ensure that the Grasshopper can reach the end of the string by only landing on vowels. For instance, in the input "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT", the code would return 4, which is the maximum distance between consecutive vowels. However, the correct answer should be 3 because the Grasshopper can jump from 'A' to 'E' to 'Y' with a jump ability of 3. The code fails to account for the requirement of reaching the end of the string, hence it does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case.
