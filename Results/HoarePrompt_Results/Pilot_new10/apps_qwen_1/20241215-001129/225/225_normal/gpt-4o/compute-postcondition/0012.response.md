According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `s` is a string
- `i` is the index `i + 1` within the string `s`
- `prev_pos` is `i + 1`
- `max_jump` remains unchanged
- If `s[i]` is a vowel, this condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition also holds as there are no changes in `prev_pos` and `max_jump` in the else part.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of the string `s`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is the index `i + 2` within the string `s`, `prev_pos` is `i + 2`, and `max_jump` remains unchanged.**
