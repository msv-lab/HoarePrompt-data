The code updates `max_jump` to be the maximum value between its current value and `i - prev_pos`. Given that `i` is the index `i + 1` within the string `s` and `prev_pos` is updated to `i + 1`, the expression `i - prev_pos` simplifies to `(i + 1) - (i + 1)` which equals 0. Therefore, `max_jump` will be updated to be the maximum value between its current value and 0. Since `max_jump` remains unchanged unless it is less than 0, the value of `max_jump` will stay the same.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is the index `i + 1` within the string `s`, `prev_pos` is updated to `i + 1`, and `max_jump` remains unchanged.**
