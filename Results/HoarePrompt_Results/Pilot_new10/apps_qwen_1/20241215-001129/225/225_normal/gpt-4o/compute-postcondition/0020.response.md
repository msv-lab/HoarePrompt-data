Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step:

1. **Parameter Acceptance**: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters and may contain the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'.

2. **Vowel Identification and Jump Calculation**:
   - The function initializes a set of vowels (`vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}`).
   - It also initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1.
   - The function iterates through each character in the string `s` using a `for` loop.
   - For each character, it checks if the character is a vowel. If it is, it updates `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between the current index `i` and `prev_pos` (the last position of a vowel found).

3. **Final Adjustment and Return**:
   - After the loop, the function adjusts `max_jump` one more time by taking the maximum of its current value and the difference between the length of the string `len(s)` and `prev_pos` (the last index of a vowel found).
   - The function then returns `max_jump`.

4. **Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - If the string `s` does not contain any vowels, `prev_pos` remains -1 throughout the loop. In this case, `max_jump` would be adjusted in the final step as `max(1, len(s) - (-1))`, which simplifies to `max(1, len(s) + 1)`. Since `len(s)` is at least 1, `max_jump` will be `len(s) + 1`.

Given the analysis, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and returns the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string. If no vowels are present, it returns the length of the string plus one.**
