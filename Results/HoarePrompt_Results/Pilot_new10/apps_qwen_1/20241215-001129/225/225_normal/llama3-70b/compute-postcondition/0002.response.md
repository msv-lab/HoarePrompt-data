The code assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. The length of a string is calculated by counting the number of characters in the string. The value of `s` is a user input string, so `n` will be the number of characters in `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the user input string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`**
