The code `s = input()` reads a non-empty string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The length of this string does not exceed 100 and it may contain the following vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y'. After executing this line, the initial state of `s` is replaced by the user input.

Output State: **`s` is the user input string**
