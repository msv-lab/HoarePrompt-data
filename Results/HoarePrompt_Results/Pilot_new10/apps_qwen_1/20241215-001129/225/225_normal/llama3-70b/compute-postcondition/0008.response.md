`max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between `max_jump` and `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0 (as stated in the precondition), `i + 1` is 1. Given that `last_vowel` equals -1 and `n` is the length of `s`, the value of `max_jump` is updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the user input string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0, `s[i]` is a vowel, `n` must be greater than 0, and `last_vowel` equals -1**
