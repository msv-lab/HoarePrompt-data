Postcondition: **`max_jump` is an integer. If `last_vowel` is -1, `max_jump` remains 3. Otherwise, if the character at index 1 is a vowel, `max_jump` is set to 2; if the character at index 1 is not a vowel, `max_jump` is set to 1. In both cases, `max_jump` is then updated to `max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`.**
