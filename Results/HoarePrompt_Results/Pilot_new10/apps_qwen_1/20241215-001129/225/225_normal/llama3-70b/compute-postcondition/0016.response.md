The code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Given the initial conditions, we know that `i` starts at 1 and `last_vowel` is 0. Plugging these values into the expression, we get:

- Initially, `max_jump` is 1.
- The expression evaluates to `(1 - 0) // 2 + 1 = 1 // 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

Since `max_jump` is currently 1 and the new value calculated is also 1, `max_jump` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `max_jump` is still 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the user input string, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is 0, `i` is 1**
