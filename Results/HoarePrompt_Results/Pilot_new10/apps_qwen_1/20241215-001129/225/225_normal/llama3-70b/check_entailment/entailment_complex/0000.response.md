Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, as specified in the problem description.
2. **Vowel Identification**: The program checks each character in the string to see if it is a vowel ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'). This is done correctly using the `if s[i] in vowels:` condition.
3. **Jump Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible jump distance required to jump from one vowel to another. It ensures that the Grasshopper can reach the next vowel or the end of the string with the minimum jump ability. This is achieved through the `max_jump` variable and the logic inside the `for` loop.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the last vowel might not be the final position in the string. After the `for` loop, there is a check to ensure that if the last vowel is not the last character, the remaining distance to the end of the string is considered.
5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated maximum jump distance, which is the required output.

Given that the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.
