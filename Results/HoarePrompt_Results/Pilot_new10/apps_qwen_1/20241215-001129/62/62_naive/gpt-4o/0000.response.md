Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function. It then compares the decimal values of the two numbers and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on their comparison. 

Given the problem description and the examples, this approach ensures that the program works correctly for any valid inputs within the specified constraints. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where the program might fail to meet the requirements described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
