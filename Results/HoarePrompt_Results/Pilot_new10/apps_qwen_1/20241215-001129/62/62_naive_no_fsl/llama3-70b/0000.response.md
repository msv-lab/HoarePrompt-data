Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers given in different bases. It reads the number of digits and the base for each number, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and then compares the resulting decimal values.

The function `func_1` correctly converts a number from a given base to a decimal integer. The program then compares these decimal values and prints the appropriate character ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison.

Since the program handles all the described cases correctly as per the examples provided and the general logic of comparing numbers in different bases, it is correct. There are no edge cases or inputs that would make this program incorrect based on the given problem description and examples.
