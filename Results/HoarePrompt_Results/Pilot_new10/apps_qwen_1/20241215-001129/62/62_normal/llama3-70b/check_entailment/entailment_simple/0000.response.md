Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly parses the input as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of digits and the base for the first number (`X`), followed by the digits themselves. Then, it reads the number of digits and the base for the second number (`Y`), followed by the digits themselves.

2. **Base Conversion**:
   - The `func_1` function converts a list of digits representing a number in a given base to its decimal (base-10) equivalent. This function correctly handles the conversion by iterating through each digit and updating the result based on the current base.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After converting both numbers to their decimal representations using the `func_1` function, the program compares the two decimal values. It outputs `<`, `>`, or `=` based on the comparison, exactly as required by the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles all edge cases as described:
     - Leading zeros are not an issue because the input ensures no leading zeros.
     - Different bases are handled properly by the conversion function.
     - The constraints on the number of digits (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10) and the bases (2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40) are respected.
     - The comparison is done accurately between the converted decimal values.

Since the program follows the exact steps and constraints specified in the problem description, it is correct.
