According to the given code, the loop will iterate over each digit in the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, the `digits` list must contain at least one element.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `base` is defined and represents the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40). This value does not affect whether the loop can execute, so we do not need to adjust its state.

2. The variable `result` is initialized to 0. This value also does not affect whether the loop can execute, so we do not need to adjust its state.

3. The loop will only execute if the `digits` list contains at least one element. Therefore, `digits` must be a non-empty list.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `digits` must be a non-empty list.

State: **`digits` is a non-empty list, `base` is an integer representing the base of the number system (2 ≤ base ≤ 40), `result` is 0**
