Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description and the examples provided. The program correctly reads the input, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and compares the resulting decimal values. The function `func_1` correctly converts a number from a given base to a decimal integer. The program handles all the described cases correctly as per the examples provided and the general logic of comparing numbers in different bases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
