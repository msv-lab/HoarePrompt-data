Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function. The program then compares these decimal values and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on their comparison. Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program meets all the requirements and there are no identified issues or edge cases that would cause it to fail. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
