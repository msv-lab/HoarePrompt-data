Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both indicate that the program correctly converts numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function and then compares the decimal values. The annotations describe the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function `func_1` correctly processes the digits list and calculates the decimal value for the given base. Given the problem description and the logical flow of the program, the original assessment is accurate.
