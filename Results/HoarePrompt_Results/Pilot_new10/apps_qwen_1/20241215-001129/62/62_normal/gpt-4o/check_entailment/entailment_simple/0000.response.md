Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of digits (`n`) and the base (`b_x`) for the first number `X`, followed by the digits themselves.
   - It then reads similar information for the second number `Y`.

2. **Conversion to Decimal**:
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1` to convert the number from its given base to decimal. This function correctly handles the conversion as described:
     - It initializes `decimal_value` to 0.
     - For each digit in the list, it multiplies the current `decimal_value` by the base and adds the digit.
     - The function returns the resulting decimal value.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares them.
   - Depending on the comparison result, it prints `<`, `>`, or `=` as required.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases as specified in the problem description:
     - No leading zeroes.
     - Both numbers are positive.
     - Digits are within the valid range for the given base.
     - Different bases for `X` and `Y`.

Since the program accurately follows the steps and conditions outlined in the problem description for all potential inputs, the correctness is **True**.
