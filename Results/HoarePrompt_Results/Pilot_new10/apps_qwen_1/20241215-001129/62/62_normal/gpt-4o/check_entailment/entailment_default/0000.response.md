Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function and then compares the decimal values. The function `func_1` correctly handles the conversion process without leading zeros and ensures that all digits are within the valid range for the given base. The main program logic correctly compares the decimal values and outputs the appropriate character ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison. Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program works correctly for every potential case.
