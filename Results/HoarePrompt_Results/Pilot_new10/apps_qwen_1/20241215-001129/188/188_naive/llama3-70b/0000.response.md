Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose numbers to make the game fair. Specifically, the logic used to find `a1` and `a2` is flawed. The program checks if any number appears exactly `n//2` times and assumes these are the numbers Petya and Vasya should choose. However, this approach fails to consider cases where no such number exists, or where the distribution of card counts does not allow both players to end up with exactly half the cards.

For example, consider the following input:

```
Input
6
1
1
2
2
3
3

Output
NO
```

In this case, the program should output "NO" because there is no way to choose two distinct numbers such that both players can take exactly half the cards. However, the current implementation might incorrectly return "YES" and print two distinct numbers, which is not correct according to the problem description.
