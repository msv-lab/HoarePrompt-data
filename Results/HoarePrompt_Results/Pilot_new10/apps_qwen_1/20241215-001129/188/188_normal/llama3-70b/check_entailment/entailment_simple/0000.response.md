Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Petya and Vasya can choose integers such that they can fairly take all the cards.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of cards \( n \) and the integers written on the cards, storing them in a list `a`.

2. **Counting Frequencies**: Using a dictionary `d`, the program counts the frequency of each integer in the list `a`.

3. **Checking Fairness Conditions**:
   - For the game to be fair, each player needs to take exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) cards.
   - This means there must be exactly two different integers in the list `a` that appear exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. Any other configuration would result in one or both players being unable to take exactly half of the cards.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - If there are exactly two distinct integers that each appear \( \frac{n}{2} \) times, the program prints "YES" followed by these two integers.
   - If no such pair exists, the program prints "NO".

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Handling All Cases**: The program checks all possible cases where the integers and their frequencies are consistent with the requirement for a fair game.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases like when \( n \) is small (e.g., \( n = 2 \)) or when all integers are the same.
- **Output Format**: The program outputs "YES" with two distinct integers if such a pair exists, and "NO" otherwise, adhering to the specified output format.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all valid inputs.
