The code appends an integer input to the list `a`. Since `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is an empty list, after running the code, `a` will contain one element, which is an integer input from the user. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing one element, which is an integer input**
