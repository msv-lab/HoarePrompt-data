The code assigns the value `1` to the dictionary `d` at the key `i`. Since `i` is the first element of the list `a` and `i` was not previously in `d`, the dictionary `d` now contains one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `d` is a dictionary containing `{i: 1}`, `i` is not in `d` is no longer true.**
