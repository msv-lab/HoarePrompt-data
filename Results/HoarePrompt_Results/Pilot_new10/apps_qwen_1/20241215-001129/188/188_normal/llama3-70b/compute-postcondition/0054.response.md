The code `print(a1, a2)` does not modify any variables. It simply prints the values of `a1` and `a2`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is an even number between 2 and 100.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`.
- `c` is either 0, 1, or 2.
- `a1` is either -1 or the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`.
- `a2` is either -1 or equal to `i`.

After executing the print statement, the values of `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged. The output will be the values of `a1` and `a2` as they are currently defined.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is either -1 or equal to `i`, the output is the printed values of `a1` and `a2`.**
