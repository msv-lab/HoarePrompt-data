The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is `1`, `a1` is the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is -1, `d` must have at least one key.
