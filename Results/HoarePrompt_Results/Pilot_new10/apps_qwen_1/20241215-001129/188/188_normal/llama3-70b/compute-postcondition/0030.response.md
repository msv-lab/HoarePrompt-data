The code `a1 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is a key from the dictionary `d`) to the variable `a1`. Since `i` is a key in the dictionary `d` and the value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, the value of `a1` is set to this key `i`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is -1, `d` must have at least one key**
