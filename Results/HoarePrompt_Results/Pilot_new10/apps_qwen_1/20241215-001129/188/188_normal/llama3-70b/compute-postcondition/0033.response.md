The code `a2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `a2`. However, `i` is not defined within the given code snippet, and there's no context or assignment to `i` before this line. Given the lack of a definition for `i`, we cannot determine the exact value that `a2` will take. Nevertheless, we can state that `i` must be a valid value for the assignment to occur.

Since `i` is not defined, the only changes we can accurately describe are to the variables `a2`, which is now assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` is equal to `i`, `d` must have at least one key, there exists no key `i` in `d` such that the value of `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`**
