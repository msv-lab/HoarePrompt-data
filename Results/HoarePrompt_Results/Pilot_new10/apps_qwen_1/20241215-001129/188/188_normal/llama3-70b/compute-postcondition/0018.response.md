`d[i]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `i` is the second element of the list `a`, which means `i` is an integer. The value of `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, and the values of `a` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, and `d` is a dictionary with key `i` set to `1`.**
