`a.append(int(input()))` appends the integer input to the list `a`. The initial value of `a` is a list containing one element, which is an integer input. After appending, `a` will now contain two elements: the original integer and the new integer input. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and the value of `i` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the original integer and the second element is the integer input, `i` is `n`**
