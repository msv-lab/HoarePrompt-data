Postcondition: ***`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a1` is either -1 or the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is either -1 or equal to `i`. The output is the printed values of `a1` and `a2` if `a1` and `a2` are not -1. If `a1` and `a2` are -1, the program simply continues without printing anything.***
