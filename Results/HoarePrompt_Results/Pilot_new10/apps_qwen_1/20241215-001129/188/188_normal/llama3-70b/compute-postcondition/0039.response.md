`c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 or 1 to 1 or 2 respectively. The values of `n`, `a`, `d`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is 1 or 2, `a1` is equal to `i`, `a2` is either -1 or equal to `i`, `d` must have at least one key.**
