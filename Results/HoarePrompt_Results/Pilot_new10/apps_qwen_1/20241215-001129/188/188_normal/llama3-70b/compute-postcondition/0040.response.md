`a2` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is a key from the dictionary `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `a1` is either -1 or the key `i` from `d` such that `d[i]` is equal to `n // 2`, `a2` is equal to `i`, `d` must have at least one key.
