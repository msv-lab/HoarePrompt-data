Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `a` is a list containing one element, which is an integer input.

2. **Loop Statement**: The loop statement is:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` would be `n-1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should now be `n`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The value of `i` is now `n`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the current iteration (since `n` does not change within the loop).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should be: `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing one element, which is an integer input, and `i` is `n`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing one element, which is an integer input, `i` is `n`**
