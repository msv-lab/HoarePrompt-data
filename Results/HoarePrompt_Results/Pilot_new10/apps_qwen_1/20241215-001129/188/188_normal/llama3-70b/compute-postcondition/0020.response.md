Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an even number between 2 and 100.
   - `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer.
   - `i` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `d` is a dictionary.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - For each element `i` in the list `a`, if `i` is in the dictionary `d`, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `d`, the key `i` is set to `1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second element of the list `a`.
   - Since we are now starting the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Next Element in List:**
   - The next element in the list `a` will be the third element since `i` was the second element in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be updated to this new value.

5. **Dictionary Update:**
   - The behavior of the dictionary `d` does not change the overall structure of the dictionary itself. It only updates the value associated with the key `i` if it exists or sets the key to 1 if it doesn't. However, the dictionary `d` remains unchanged from the previous iteration's context.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `n` remains an even number between 2 and 100.
   - `a` remains the same list but with `i` updated to the third element.
   - `d` remains the same dictionary as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` is updated to the third element of the list `a`.
- `n` and `d` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, and `d` is a dictionary.**
