The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the first element of the list `a`, and it is initially present in the dictionary `d` with a value of 1 (as per the initial state), the value of `d[i]` will be incremented by 1.

Given that `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, and `d` is initially `{i: 1}`, after executing the code, `d[i]` will be `2`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `n` remains an even number between 2 and 100.
- `a` remains a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer.
- `i` remains the first element of the list `a`.
- `d` now contains `{i: 2}`.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100; `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer; `i` is the first element of the list `a`; `d` is a dictionary with `{i: 2}`.**
