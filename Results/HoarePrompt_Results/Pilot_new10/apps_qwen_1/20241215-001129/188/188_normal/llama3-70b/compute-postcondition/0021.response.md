`d[i]` is updated by adding 1 to the current value of `d[i]`. Since `i` is the third element of the list `a`, and `n` is an even number between 2 and 100, the value of `i` is one of the integers from 0 to `n-1`. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, and the initial value of `d[i]` is also not specified. Therefore, we can only say that `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even number between 2 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is an integer, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, and `d` is a dictionary; `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
