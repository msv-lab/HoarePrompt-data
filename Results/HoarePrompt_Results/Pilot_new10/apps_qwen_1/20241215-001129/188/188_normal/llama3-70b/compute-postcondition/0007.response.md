`a.append(int(input()))` appends an integer input to the list `a`. Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `a`, it is assumed to be an empty list. The code takes an integer input from the user and appends it to `a`. After this operation, the list `a` will contain one element, which is the integer input.

Output State: **`a` is `[int(input())]`**
