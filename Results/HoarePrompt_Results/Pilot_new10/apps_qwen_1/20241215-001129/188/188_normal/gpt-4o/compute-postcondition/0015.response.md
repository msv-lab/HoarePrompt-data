Functionality: **The function processes an even number of integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), where each integer (a_{i}) is between 1 and 100. It then counts the occurrences of each unique integer, sorts them by their counts, and checks if the two most frequent integers each occur exactly n // 2 times. If they do, it prints 'YES' followed by these two integers. If not, it prints 'NO'. If there are fewer than two unique numbers, it also prints 'NO'.**
