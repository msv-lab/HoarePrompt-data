The code `print(unique_numbers[-1], unique_numbers[-2])` prints the last two elements of the `unique_numbers` list. Since the `unique_numbers` list is sorted by the counts of the unique numbers in ascending order, the last element (`unique_numbers[-1]`) is the largest unique number, and the second last element (`unique_numbers[-2]`) is the second largest unique number.

Given the conditions:
- The length of `unique_numbers` is at least 2.
- The count of the largest unique number in `unique_numbers` is equal to `n // 2`.
- The count of the second largest unique number in `unique_numbers` is also equal to `n // 2`.

These conditions imply that the last two elements of `unique_numbers` are the largest and second largest unique numbers, both occurring `n // 2` times.

The code does not change the values of any variables; it only prints the values of the last two elements of `unique_numbers`. The output will be the values of the largest and second largest unique numbers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `count` is a Counter object with elements from `cards` and their counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique numbers from `cards` sorted by their counts in ascending order, the last two elements of `unique_numbers` are printed (the largest and second largest unique numbers each occurring `n // 2` times).**
