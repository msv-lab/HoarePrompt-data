Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider all necessary conditions to ensure the minimum number of additional marks required to measure both `x` and `y`. Let's analyze a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3 250 185 230
0 185 250
```

Expected output:
```
1
230
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs:
```
0
```

This happens because the program checks for the presence of `x` and `y` directly in the given marks and only adds them if they are missing. It does not consider the possibility of adding a mark that can help in measuring both `x` and `y`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the added marks can cover both `x` and `y`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize sets to keep track of required distances
    required = {x, y}
    additional_marks = []
    
    # Check if x and y can be measured with existing marks
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            diff = marks[j] - marks[i]
            if diff in required:
                required.remove(diff)
    
    # Add missing marks
    while required:
        min_diff = min(required)
        additional_marks.append(min_diff)
        required -= {diff for diff in required if diff % min_diff == 0}
    
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(additional_marks))))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that it finds the minimum number of additional marks required to measure both `x` and `y` by considering the least common multiple (LCM) of the remaining required distances.
