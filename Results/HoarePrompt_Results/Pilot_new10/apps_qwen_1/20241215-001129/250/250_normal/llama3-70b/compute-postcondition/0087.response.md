Postcondition: ***`additional_marks` is modified such that it contains `i + j` as its first element. If `additional_marks` was initially non-empty, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`. If `additional_marks` was initially empty, `j` becomes undefined, but `i + j` is added as the first element of `additional_marks`.***
