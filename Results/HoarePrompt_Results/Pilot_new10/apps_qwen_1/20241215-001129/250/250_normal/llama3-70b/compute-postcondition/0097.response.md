According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `additional_marks`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:
- `i` is the third element of the `marks` list.
- `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `need_x` is `False`.
- `need_y` is `False`.
- `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be the second-to-last element of `additional_marks` because the loop iterates over each element starting from the last element.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

1. The value of `i` remains the same since it is determined by the `marks` list and does not change within the loop.
2. Since `j` needs to be the second-to-last element of `additional_marks` for the next iteration, we update `j` to be the second-to-last element.
3. The condition `i + j <= l` and `i + j` not being in `marks` would be checked in the loop body, but the states themselves do not change unless the loop modifies them.

Therefore, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:
- `i` is the third element of the `marks` list.
- `j` is the second-to-last element of `additional_marks`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `need_x` is `False`.
- `need_y` is `False`.
- `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the second-to-last element of `additional_marks`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` has at least 2 elements**
