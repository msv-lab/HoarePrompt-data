Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `need_x` is set to True if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, otherwise `need_x` remains unchanged
   - `need_y` is True

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i` to `n`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is still 0 (since `i` is not incremented in this loop)
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (no change in `n`)
   - `need_x` remains unchanged based on the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`
   - `need_y` is True (no change in `need_y`)

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must increment from its current value.
   - The smallest possible value for `j` would be `i + 1` (which is 1 in this case).

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - `i` remains 0
   - `n` must still be greater than 0
   - `need_x` is now determined based on `j = 1` (since `j` starts from `i + 1`)
   - `need_y` remains True

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `need_x` is set to True if `marks[1] - marks[0]` equals `y`, otherwise `need_x` remains unchanged, and `need_y` is True**
