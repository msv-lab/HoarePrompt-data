The code `need_y = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_y`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `need_x`, or the `marks` list. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the values of these variables, except for `need_y`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `need_x` is unchanged, `need_y` is True**
