The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`. Since the input is not specified, the values of these variables will be determined by the input. However, we know the constraints on these variables:

- `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- `2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`
- `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`

The sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` is given where `0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l`, which means the sequence is strictly increasing from 0 to `l`.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` will be updated based on the input, but their relative constraints will still hold.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`; the values are determined by the input.**
