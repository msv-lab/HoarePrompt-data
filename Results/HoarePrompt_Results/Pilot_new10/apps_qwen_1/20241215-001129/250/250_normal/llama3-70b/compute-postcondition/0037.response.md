Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, `j` is 2, and `marks[2] - marks[0] == x` holds. The if condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` is evaluated, and if true, no changes are made to the variables from their initial state; otherwise, the condition remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.***
