The code appends the value of `i + j` to the `additional_marks` list. Given that `i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n`, and `additional_marks` is initially a list containing `x` and `y` unless certain conditions are met, the value of `i + j` is appended to this list.

Since the condition `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks` is not specified to be checked before appending, and given that `additional_marks` is defined as a list containing `x` and `y` if these conditions are not met, the value `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.

Therefore, the updated state of `additional_marks` is now a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + j`.

Output State: **`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + j`.**
