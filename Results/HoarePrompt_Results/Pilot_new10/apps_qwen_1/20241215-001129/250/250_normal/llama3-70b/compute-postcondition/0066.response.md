`additional_marks.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `additional_marks`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `y`, it remains unchanged. The list `additional_marks` initially contains `x`, and now it will contain both `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`.**
