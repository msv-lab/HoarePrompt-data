Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False` because there do not exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, `need_y` is still `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, and `additional_marks` is an empty list.***
