`need_x` is reassigned to `True`, but since its initial value was already `True`, this assignment does not change the value of `need_x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, `j` is 2, and `marks[2] - marks[0] == x` holds.**
