The code `need_y = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `need_x`, or the `marks` list. Therefore, the Output State remains as follows:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `marks[2] - marks[0] == x` holds. If the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` is true, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition continues to hold as initially stated.**
