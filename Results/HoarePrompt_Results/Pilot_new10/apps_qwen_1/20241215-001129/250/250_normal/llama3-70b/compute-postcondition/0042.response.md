Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is \(n + 1\)
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - `need_x` is `True`
   - `need_y` is `True`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop `for j in range(i, n)` will execute if and only if the start value of `i` is less than the stop value `n`.

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   Given `i = n + 1`, we need to check if \(i < n\). This would imply that \(n + 1 < n\), which is impossible. Therefore, the condition \(i < n\) cannot be satisfied.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   Since the loop will not execute due to the condition being unsatisfiable (i.e., \(i\) cannot be less than \(n\) when \(i = n + 1\)), no other state adjustments are necessary. However, we should still include the given conditions for completeness.

**Final State:**
- `i` is \(n + 1\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `need_x` is `True`
- `need_y` is `True`

Since the loop will not execute due to the initial values of `i` and `n`, these are the states that need to be adjusted (or rather, kept as they are, since the loop will not run).

State: **`i` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`**
