Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - If `additional_marks` is not empty, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`.
   - If `additional_marks` is empty, the state remains unchanged.

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   additional_marks.append(i + j)
   ```

   This line of code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to `additional_marks`.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - If `additional_marks` was not empty, `j` is still the first element of `additional_marks`.
   - If `additional_marks` was empty, the state remains unchanged, meaning `j` is still undefined.
   - Regardless of whether `additional_marks` was empty or not, now `additional_marks` will have one more element, which is `i + j`.

4. Updated States:
   - If `additional_marks` was not empty, the new first element of `additional_marks` will be `i + j` instead of the original `j`.
   - If `additional_marks` was empty, `j` remains undefined, but `additional_marks` will contain `i + j` as its first element.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **If `additional_marks` was not empty, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` now contains `i + j`. If `additional_marks` was empty, `j` is undefined, but `additional_marks` now contains `i + j` as its first element.**
