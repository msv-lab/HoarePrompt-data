The code initializes an empty list `additional_marks`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, and `additional_marks` is an empty list.**
