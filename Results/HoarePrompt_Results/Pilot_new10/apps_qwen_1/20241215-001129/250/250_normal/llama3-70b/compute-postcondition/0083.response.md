The code appends the sum of `i` and `j` to the `additional_marks` list. Given the initial conditions, `i` is the second element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, and `i + j` is not already in `marks` and is less than or equal to `l`.

After executing `additional_marks.append(i + j)`, the value of `i + j` is added to `additional_marks`. Since `i` and `j` are fixed but their specific values are not provided, we denote the new value in `additional_marks` as `i + j`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the second element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` contains the elements from before plus `i + j`, and the sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `l` and the sum is not in the `marks` list**.
