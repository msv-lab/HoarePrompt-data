Output State: **`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list that may contain elements `x`, `y`, and any valid `i + j` where `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is `n-1`, and `additional_marks` contains `x` and `y`.
- The loop iterates over each element `j` in `additional_marks`. For each iteration, if `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.
- After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be the last element of `additional_marks` that was considered during the loop. This is because the loop iterates through each element of `additional_marks` exactly once.
- If the loop does not execute (which would be the case if no elements in `additional_marks` satisfy the condition `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`), then `additional_marks` will remain as `[x, y]`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` do not change throughout the loop.
