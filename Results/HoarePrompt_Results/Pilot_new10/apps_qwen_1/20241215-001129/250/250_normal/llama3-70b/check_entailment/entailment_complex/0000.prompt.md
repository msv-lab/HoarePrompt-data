# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, l, x, and y are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, and a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is given where 0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l.
def func():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    need_x, need_y = False, False
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_y` is `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.
    additional_marks = []
    if (not need_x) :
        additional_marks.append(x)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` remains `True` if there exist any pair `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`, and `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`.
    if (not need_y) :
        additional_marks.append(y)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`.
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is the last element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, and `additional_marks` is a list that contains all unique elements `i + j` such that `i + j \leq l` and `i + j` is not already in `marks`. If the loop does not execute, the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remain the same, and `additional_marks` remains unchanged.
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, which are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\). It also takes a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n = l\).

The function first reads the sequence `marks` from input and checks if there are any pairs `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` or `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. If neither condition is met, it adds `x` and `y` to `additional_marks`.

Next, it iterates through each element in `marks` and each element in `additional_marks` to find new sums `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. These sums are added to `additional_marks`.

Finally, the function prints the length of `additional_marks` and the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function does not return an error message if no such sums are found; instead, it simply outputs the resulting `additional_marks`.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `x` or `y` is 0 or negative, although the constraints ensure these values are valid.
- The function assumes the input sequence `marks` is already sorted, which is necessary for the algorithm to work correctly.

### Summary:
**The function accepts integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, along with a sorted sequence of integers `marks`. It checks if there are any differences of `x` or `y` between elements in `marks` and adds these differences to a list `additional_marks`. If no such differences are found, it adds `x` and `y` to `additional_marks`. It then generates new sums of elements in `marks` and `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, adding them to `additional_marks`. Finally, it prints the length of `additional_marks` and the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces.**

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
