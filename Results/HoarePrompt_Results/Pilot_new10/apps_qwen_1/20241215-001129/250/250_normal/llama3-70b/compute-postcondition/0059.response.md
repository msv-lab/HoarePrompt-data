Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- `i` is \(n + 1\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `need_x` is `True`
- `need_y` is `True`

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i, n):
    if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
        need_x = True
    if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
        need_y = True
```

### Observations from the Provided Output States:
- After the loop executes 1 time: `i` remains \(n + 1\), `n` remains within the specified range, `need_x` and `need_y` remain `True`.
- After the loop executes 2 times: Similar to the first iteration, `i` remains \(n + 1\), `n` remains within the specified range, `need_x` and `need_y` remain `True` unless certain conditions are met.
- After the loop executes 3 times: Again, `i` remains \(n + 1\), `n` remains within the specified range, and the values of `need_x` and `need_y` are determined based on the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`.

### Analysis:
- The loop starts with `i` set to \(n + 1\), which means `i` will never enter the range of `range(i, n)` because `i` is always greater than `n`. Therefore, the loop body will never execute.
- Since the loop body never executes, the conditions inside the loop (checking `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` and `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`) will never be evaluated.
- As a result, `need_x` and `need_y` will remain `True` throughout the execution of the loop.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop body never executes, the values of `i`, `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` will remain as they were initially.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`i` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`.**
