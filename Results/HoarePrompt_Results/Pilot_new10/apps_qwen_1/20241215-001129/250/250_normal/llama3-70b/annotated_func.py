#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, which are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\). It also takes a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n = l\).

The function first reads the sequence `marks` from input and checks if there are any pairs `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` or `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. If neither condition is met, it adds `x` and `y` to `additional_marks`.

Next, it iterates through each element in `marks` and each element in `additional_marks` to find new sums `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. These sums are added to `additional_marks`.

Finally, the function prints the length of `additional_marks` and the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function does not return an error message if no such sums are found; instead, it simply outputs the resulting `additional_marks`.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `x` or `y` is 0 or negative, although the constraints ensure these values are valid.
- The function assumes the input sequence `marks` is already sorted, which is necessary for the algorithm to work correctly.

### Summary:
**The function accepts integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, along with a sorted sequence of integers `marks`. It checks if there are any differences of `x` or `y` between elements in `marks` and adds these differences to a list `additional_marks`. If no such differences are found, it adds `x` and `y` to `additional_marks`. It then generates new sums of elements in `marks` and `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, adding them to `additional_marks`. Finally, it prints the length of `additional_marks` and the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces.**
