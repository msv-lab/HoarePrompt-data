Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the first element of the `marks` list.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `need_x` is `False`.
   - `need_y` is `False`.
   - `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in the `additional_marks` list.

3. **What Needs to Be Adjusted:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be a valid element in `additional_marks`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - Since `j` is initially set to `n-1`, we need to check if `n-1` is a valid element in `additional_marks`.

5. **Possible Adjustments:**
   - If `n-1` is already in `additional_marks`, the loop will continue with the next value in `additional_marks`.
   - If `n-1` is not in `additional_marks`, the loop will terminate because there are no more elements to iterate over.

6. **State at the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - If `n-1` is in `additional_marks`, then `j` will be updated to the next element in `additional_marks`.
   - `i` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `need_x` and `need_y` remain `False` as they were not modified within the loop.
   - `additional_marks` remains the same unless the loop modifies it (which it doesn't in this case).

7. **Final State:**
   - If `n-1` is in `additional_marks`, the next `j` will be the next element in `additional_marks`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`i` is the first element of the `marks` list, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks` after `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`.**
