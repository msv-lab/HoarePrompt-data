Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and `marks[2] - marks[0] == x` holds. If the condition `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is true, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition continues to hold as initially stated.**
