To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` using `for j in additional_marks`. This means `j` will take on each value from the list `additional_marks`.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `additional_marks` has been modified such that it now contains `i + j` as its first element.
   - If `additional_marks` was initially non-empty, `j` is the first element of `additional_marks`.
   - If `additional_marks` was initially empty, `j` becomes undefined, but `i + j` is added as the first element of `additional_marks`.

3. **For Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has been set to the first element of `additional_marks`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `additional_marks` must contain at least one element (i.e., `j`).
   - After adding `i + j` as the first element, `additional_marks` will now have two elements: `j` (the original first element) and `i + j` (the new first element).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `additional_marks` must have at least one element (which is `j`).
- `j` will be the first element of `additional_marks`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` is now the first element of `additional_marks`.

State: **`additional_marks` must contain at least one element, and the first element is `j`**.

Given this, we can simplify it further:

State: **`additional_marks` must contain `j` as its first element**.
