You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Output hints: The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, which are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\). It also takes a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n = l\).

The function first reads the sequence `marks` from input and checks if there are any pairs `(i, j)` such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` or `marks[j] - marks[i] == y`. If neither condition is met, it adds `x` and `y` to `additional_marks`.

Next, it iterates through each element in `marks` and each element in `additional_marks` to find new sums `i + j` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`. These sums are added to `additional_marks`.

Finally, the function prints the length of `additional_marks` and the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function does not return an error message if no such sums are found; instead, it simply outputs the resulting `additional_marks`.
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `x` or `y` is 0 or negative, although the constraints ensure these values are valid.
- The function assumes the input sequence `marks` is already sorted, which is necessary for the algorithm to work correctly.

### Summary:
**The function accepts integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, along with a sorted sequence of integers `marks`. It checks if there are any differences of `x` or `y` between elements in `marks` and adds these differences to a list `additional_marks`. If no such differences are found, it adds `x` and `y` to `additional_marks`. It then generates new sums of elements in `marks` and `additional_marks` that are less than or equal to `l` and not already in `marks`, adding them to `additional_marks`. Finally, it prints the length of `additional_marks` and the elements of `additional_marks` separated by spaces.**

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
