`need_y` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `marks`, and `need_x` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is \(n + 1\), `j` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^5\), `marks[j] - marks[i] == x` implies `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`.**
