The code `need_y = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `need_y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `n` is greater than 1, `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and the condition `marks[j] - marks[0] == x` holds for the current value of `j`, and `x` is the difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[0]`. Additionally, `marks[j] - marks[i] == y` is true, where `y` is the current difference between `marks[j]` and `marks[i]`.**
