To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variable `j` and the list `additional_marks`. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `additional_marks` that haven't been iterated over yet.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `j`:** The problem statement mentions that `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`. This means the loop will start from the second-to-last element of `additional_marks`.

2. **List `additional_marks`:** For the loop to execute, `additional_marks` must contain at least one element. Since `j` is the last element, `additional_marks` must have at least two elements (one for `j` and another for the iteration).

3. **Other Variables:** The values of `i`, `n`, `need_x`, and `need_y` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `additional_marks` contains at least two elements.

State: **`i` is the third element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` must have at least 2 elements**.
