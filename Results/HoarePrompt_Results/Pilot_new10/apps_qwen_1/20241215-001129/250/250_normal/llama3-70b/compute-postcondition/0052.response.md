The code `need_y = True` simply reassigns the variable `need_y` to the value `True`. This does not affect the value of `i`, `n`, `need_x`, or the condition involving `marks`.

Output State: **`i` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`.**
