Postcondition: **`i` is the second element of the `marks` list, `j` is the last element of `additional_marks` after all iterations, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list that must contain at least one element, and the sum of `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `l` and the sum is not in the `marks` list**
