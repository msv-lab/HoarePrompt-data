`need_x` is reassigned the value `True`. Since no other changes are made to the variables, the values of `i`, `n`, `need_y`, and the condition remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \(n + 1\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `need_x` is `True`, `need_y` is `True`, and the condition \(marks[j] - marks[i] == x\) does not hold**
