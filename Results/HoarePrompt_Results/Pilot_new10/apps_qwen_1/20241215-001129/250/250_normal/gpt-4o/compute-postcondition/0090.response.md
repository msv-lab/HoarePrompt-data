Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True` if any `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. If both `x_found` and `y_found` are `True`, the loop breaks and these conditions remain true. If `x_found` or `y_found` is not `True` after iterating through all elements in `marks`, they remain as originally set (both `False`). `marks_set` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `new_marks` is non-empty, `new_marks` is a set containing the elements derived from the `marks` list except one element which was printed, and `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged unless the conditions for finding `x_found` or `y_found` are met. If `new_marks` is empty, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing `x`, and the length of `result` is printed.***
