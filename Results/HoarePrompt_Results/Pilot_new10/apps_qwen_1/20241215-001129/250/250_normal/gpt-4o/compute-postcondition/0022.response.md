According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over each element in the `marks` list, and for each `mark`, it checks if either `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`. If the condition inside the if block is true, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

Let's break down the states step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `mark` which is an element of the `marks` list. The other relevant variables are `y` and `marks_set`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, there must be at least one more element in the `marks` list. This means `mark` should be an element of the `marks` list and there should still be elements left to iterate over.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop directly.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop directly.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `marks_set` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `mark` is the current element being processed in the `marks` list. After processing, `mark` becomes the next element in the `marks` list.

Given that the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `marks` list, the next `mark` should be the next element in the `marks` list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `mark` is the next element in the `marks` list.**
