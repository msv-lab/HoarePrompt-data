`new_marks` is updated by adding `mark - x` for each `mark` in `marks`. Since `x_found` is `False`, the value of `x` is unchanged. The value of `y_found` remains `False` because the condition for setting `y_found` to `True` is not met. The `marks_set` and `y` remain unchanged. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`marks` must contain at least one element, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark - x` for each `mark` in `marks`, and neither `x_found` nor `y_found` is `True`.**
