Postcondition: ***`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list; `x_found` remains `False`; `y_found` is `True` if any `5 + y` or `5 - y` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` is a set containing elements derived from the `marks` list according to the specified conditions, including `mark - x_val`. If `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is found in `marks_set`, then `x_val` is updated to the respective value and added to `new_marks`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `x_val` or `new_marks`.***
