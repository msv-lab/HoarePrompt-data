The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it works with a sequence of integers `a` which is defined within the function scope and is given as part of the problem statement. The function also takes into account the following constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\).
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\).
- A sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is given, where \(0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n = l\), representing the distances of the marks from the origin.

Based on the provided constraints and the sequence `a`, the function will return a value depending on certain conditions related to `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates on a sequence of integers `a`, and given integers `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, it returns a value based on specific conditions.**
