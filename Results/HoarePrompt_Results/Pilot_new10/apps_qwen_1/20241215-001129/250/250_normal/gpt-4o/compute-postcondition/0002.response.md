The code creates a set `marks_set` from the list `marks`. This means all duplicate elements in `marks` will be removed, and `marks_set` will contain unique elements from `marks`.

The initial values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The list `marks` is transformed into a set `marks_set` containing unique elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list.**
