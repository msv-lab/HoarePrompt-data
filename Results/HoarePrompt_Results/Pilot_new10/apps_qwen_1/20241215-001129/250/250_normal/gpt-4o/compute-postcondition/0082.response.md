The code `result.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the `result` list. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we'll keep it as `x` in the output state. Other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing `x`.**
