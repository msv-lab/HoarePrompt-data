The code snippet `new_marks.add(mark - y)` adds the value `mark - y` to the set `new_marks`. This operation does not affect the values of `marks_set`, `x_found`, or `y_found`. It only updates the value of `new_marks`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list; `x_found` remains `False`; `y_found` is `True` if any `5 + y` or `5 - y` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` contains elements derived from the `marks` list according to the specified conditions, now including `mark - y`.**
