Postcondition: ***`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list; `x_found` remains `False`; `y_found` is `True` if any `5 + y` or `5 - y` is in `marks_set`; `new_marks` contains elements derived from the `marks` list according to the specified conditions, now including `mark - y` if `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is found in `marks_set`. If neither condition in the if part is met, `mark - x_val` is added to `new_marks`, where `x_val` is updated as necessary.***
