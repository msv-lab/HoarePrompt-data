`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values of the integers read from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are now integers derived from the input, and the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` is not yet defined or updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `l` is an integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l; `x` and `y` are assigned values from the input, and the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` is unchanged.**
