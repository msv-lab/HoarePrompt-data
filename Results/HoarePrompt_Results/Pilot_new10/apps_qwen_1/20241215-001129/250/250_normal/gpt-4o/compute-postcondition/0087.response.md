The code `print(len(result))` prints the length of the `result` list. Since there is no modification of any variable inside this print statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The length of `result` is printed, but the output does not affect the state of the variables.

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` remains `False`, `y_found` is still `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is a list containing `x`, and the length of `result` is printed.**
