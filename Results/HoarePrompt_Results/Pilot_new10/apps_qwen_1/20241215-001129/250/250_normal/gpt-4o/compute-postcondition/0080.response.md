The given code snippet initializes the variable `result` as an empty list. No operations are performed on the existing variables `marks_set`, `x_found`, `y_found`, and `new_marks`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is an empty set, `result` is an empty list.**
