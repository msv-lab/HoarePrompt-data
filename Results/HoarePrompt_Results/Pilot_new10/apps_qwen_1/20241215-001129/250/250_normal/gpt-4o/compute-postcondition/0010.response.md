`y_found` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the previous value of `y_found` (which was `True` or `False`) is now definitively `True`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is an integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `True` or remains `False`, `y_found` is `True`, `marks` must be non-empty, `mark + y` is in `marks_set` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `y_found` is `True`**
