Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to handle cases where neither `x` nor `y` can be measured using the existing marks and the conditions checked are insufficient to guarantee finding the minimum number of additional marks needed.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  2 300 185 230
  0 300
  ```

The code logic in the `else` block only checks for sums and differences involving `x` and `y` with the existing marks, but it does not ensure that the minimum number of additional marks is found. In this case, the code would incorrectly output `2` and `[185, 230]` because it simply appends `x` and `y` to the result list without verifying if these values can actually be formed using the given conditions.

To properly solve this problem, the code needs to:
1. Ensure that all possible pairs of marks are checked for the sums and differences required to form `x` and `y`.
2. Use a more systematic approach to find the minimum number of additional marks needed, possibly using a combination of sets and dynamic programming or breadth-first search to explore all possibilities efficiently.

The current implementation does not cover all necessary cases and can lead to incorrect results, hence the correctness is **False**.
