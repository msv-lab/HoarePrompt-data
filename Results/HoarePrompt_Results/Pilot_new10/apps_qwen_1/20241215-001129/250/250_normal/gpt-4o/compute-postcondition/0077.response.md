The code snippet simply prints `1`. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`marks_set` is a set of unique integers from the original `marks` list, `x_found` is `False`, `y_found` is `True` if any `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, `new_marks` is a non-empty set containing the elements derived from the `marks` list according to the specified conditions, and `x_found` and `y_found` remain unchanged unless the conditions for finding `x_found` or `y_found` are met. The length of `new_marks` is greater than 0**
