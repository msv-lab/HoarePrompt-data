Let's analyze the given annotated code and return postconditions step by step:

1. **Parameter and Input Handling**:
   - The function does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it takes three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` as input using `input().split()`.
   - These values are assigned to variables `n`, `k`, and `t` respectively.
   - The constraints for `n`, `k`, and `t` are specified as \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and \(1 \leq t < n + k\).

2. **Logic and Calculation**:
   - The function calculates and prints a value based on the condition `min(t, k)` if `t <= n`.
   - If `t > n`, it calculates `k - (t - n) % k`.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - When `t <= n`: The function simply returns the minimum of `t` and `k`.
   - When `t > n`: The function computes `k - (t - n) % k`. This ensures that the result is within the range `[0, k-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function does not return anything; instead, it prints the calculated value.

Given the above analysis, the function accepts no parameters but processes three integers from user input. It calculates and prints a specific value based on the conditions described.

**Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` from user input. It prints `min(t, k)` if `t <= n`; otherwise, it prints `k - (t - n) % k`. **
