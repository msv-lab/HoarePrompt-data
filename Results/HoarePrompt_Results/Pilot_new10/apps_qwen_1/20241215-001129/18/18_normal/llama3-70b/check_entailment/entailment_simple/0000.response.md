Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Let's analyze why:

1. **Wave Pattern**: According to the problem description, the wave pattern should follow these rules:
   - At time `t`, the first `t` spectators will be standing until `t` reaches `k`.
   - After `t` exceeds `k`, the wave continues, and at each subsequent time, the next spectator stands while the one that started at the beginning of the wave sits.

2. **Sitting and Standing Logic**:
   - For `t <= k`, the number of standing spectators is simply `t`.
   - For `t > k`, the wave pattern needs to account for the spectators sitting down and new ones standing up in a cyclic manner. The logic provided in the program does not correctly handle this cyclic nature of the wave.

3. **Given Code Logic**:
   - The code uses `min(t, k)` when `t <= n`. This correctly handles the case where `t` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - However, for `t > k` and `t <= n + k`, the code uses `k - (t - n) % k`. This logic is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the cyclic behavior described in the problem statement.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 12`. According to the problem description, at `t = 12`, the wave pattern should be `---^^^^^`, with 3 spectators standing. However, the given code will output `5 - (12 - 10) % 5 = 5 - 2 = 3`, which is correct in this specific example but fails to generalize the pattern correctly for all cases.

To fix this, the program should correctly implement the cyclic nature of the wave. A correct implementation would involve determining the position of the standing spectators based on the modulo operation relative to `k` and handling the transition point correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    if t <= k:
        print(t)
    else:
        print(k - (t - k) % k)
```

With this corrected logic, the program correctly handles both the initial phase (`t <= k`) and the cyclic phase (`t > k`), ensuring that it accurately reflects the number of standing spectators at any given time `t`.
