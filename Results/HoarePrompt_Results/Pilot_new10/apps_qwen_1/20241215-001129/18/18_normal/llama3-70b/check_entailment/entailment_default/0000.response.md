Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to handle the cases where the time `t` is greater than `n`. According to the problem description, at time `t` where `t > n`, the number of standing spectators should be calculated as `k - (t - n) % k`. However, the code incorrectly prints `k - (t - n) % k` even when `t <= n`, which leads to incorrect results.

For example:
- When `t = n + 1`, the number of standing spectators should be `k - (n + 1 - n) % k = k - 1`.
- When `t = n + 2`, the number of standing spectators should be `k - (n + 2 - n) % k = k - 2`.

The current implementation will not correctly handle these cases, leading to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
