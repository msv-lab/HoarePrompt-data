Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `t` from user input using `input().split()`. These values are then converted to integers with `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - If `t <= n`, the program prints `min(t, k)`. 
     - This ensures that up to time `n`, the number of standing spectators is equal to the minimum of `t` and `k`, as the first `k` spectators will stand sequentially.
   - If `t > n`, the program prints `k - (t - n) % k`.
     - For times greater than `n`, the pattern repeats. The formula `k - (t - n) % k` calculates the number of standing spectators in the repeated cycle.
       - `(t - n) % k` gives the position within the repeating cycle of length `k`.
       - Subtracting this from `k` gives the number of spectators who are still standing after the cycle starts to repeat.

Given these observations, the program correctly handles both the initial phase (`t <= n`) and the repeating phase (`t > n`). Therefore, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all valid inputs.

Thus, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
