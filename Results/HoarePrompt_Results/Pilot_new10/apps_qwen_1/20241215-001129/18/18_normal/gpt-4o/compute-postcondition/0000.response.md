The code `n, k, t = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `t` respectively. The initial conditions given are `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ t < n + k`. After executing this line, the input values will replace the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `t` is an integer input with the constraints 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`**
