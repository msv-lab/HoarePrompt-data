The code `print(t)` simply prints the value of `t` but does not change the value of `t`. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the current value of `t`, which is less than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `t` is an integer input with the constraints 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `t` < `n` + `k`. The current value of `t` is printed and remains less than or equal to `k`.**
