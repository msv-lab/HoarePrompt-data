The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list `def func():`. The parameter constraints provided (n, k, and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ t < n + k) describe the range of valid inputs for n, k, and t but do not imply that these parameters are passed to the function.

Given the provided information, we can infer that the function might internally use n, k, and t to compute something, but since no actual function body is given, we can only describe the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters.**
