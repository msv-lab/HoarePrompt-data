Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code shows that the program does not correctly handle the case when `t > n`. According to the annotations, if `t > n`, the program outputs `n + k - t`. However, based on the problem description, when `t > n`, the number of standing spectators should decrease linearly starting from `k` until it reaches 0. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the number of standing spectators after time `n`. For example, for the input `10 5 16`, the program outputs `-1` instead of `4`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be corrected to properly handle the case when `t > n`.
