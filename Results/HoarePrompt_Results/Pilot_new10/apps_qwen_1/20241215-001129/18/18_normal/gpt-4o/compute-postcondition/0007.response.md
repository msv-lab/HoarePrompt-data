The code prints the value of `n + k - t`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` retain their original types (integer) but their values are used in the calculation. After executing the print statement, the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged. The output state includes the printed value which is `n + k - t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `t` is an integer, the printed value is `n + k - t`**
