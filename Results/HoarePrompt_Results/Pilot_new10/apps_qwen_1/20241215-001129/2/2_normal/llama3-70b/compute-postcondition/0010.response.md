The code updates `digit_sum` by converting `i + 1` to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers. The original value of `i + 1` and `max_sum` remain unchanged, and `max_num` also remains unchanged because no comparison or assignment to `max_sum` or `max_num` was performed in this snippet.

The updated value of `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`. The initial state is that `i` is `i + 1`, so we need to reflect this in the output.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `i + 1`; `max_sum` must be equal to the maximum sum found so far; `max_num` must be equal to the corresponding number found so far**
