The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_num`. Since `i` is `prev_i + 2`, `max_num` now holds this value. The other variables (`digit_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_num`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the `max_num` variable is updated to `prev_i + 2`.

Output State: **`i` is `prev_i + 2`, `digit_sum` is the sum of the digits of `prev_i + 2`, `max_sum` is `digit_sum`, `max_num` is `prev_i + 2`**
