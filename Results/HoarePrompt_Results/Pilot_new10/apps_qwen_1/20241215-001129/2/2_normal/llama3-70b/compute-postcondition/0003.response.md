Let's break down the given for loop and determine the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute:

Given:
- `x` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) (inclusive)
- `max_sum` is 0
- `max_num` is 0

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`, but the loop body itself is omitted. This means we need to ensure that the loop can actually start and run for all values from `1` to `x`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `x` is already defined and its value is between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - `max_sum` is set to 0.
   - `max_num` is set to 0.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i <= x`.
   - Therefore, `i` must take on each integer value from `1` to `x` inclusively.

### Necessary Adjustments:

- **`i` must start from 1 and go up to `x`**:
  - The loop will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until it reaches `x + 1`. However, the loop condition checks `i <= x`, so `i` should be able to reach `x`.

- **`x` must be greater than or equal to 1**:
  - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.

### Final State:

The initial state given is that `x` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) (inclusive). Since this range ensures that `x` is at least 1, we only need to ensure that `i` starts from 1 and can increment up to `x`.

Thus, the required state adjustment is:
- `x` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) (inclusive).
- `i` must start from 1 and can increment up to `x`.

Final Answer:
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) (inclusive), `i` must start from 1 and can increment up to `x`**
