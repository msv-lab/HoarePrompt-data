The code assigns the value 0 to `max_num`. The initial value of `x` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) (inclusive), and the value of `max_sum` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\) (inclusive), `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0**
