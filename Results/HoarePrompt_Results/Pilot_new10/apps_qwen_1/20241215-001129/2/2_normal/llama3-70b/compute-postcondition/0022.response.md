Functionality: **The function accepts a string input representing a positive integer \( x \) within the range 1 to \( 10^{18} \) (inclusive) and prints the number with the largest digit sum within the range 1 to \( x \).** 

This summary covers the following points:
- The function accepts a string input.
- The input is converted to an integer \( x \).
- The function iterates through all integers from 1 to \( x \), calculating the sum of digits for each integer.
- It keeps track of the integer with the highest digit sum.
- Finally, it prints the integer with the highest digit sum.
