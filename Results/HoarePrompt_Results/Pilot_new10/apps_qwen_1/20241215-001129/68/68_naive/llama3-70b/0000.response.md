Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider all scenarios involving the variable \( z \).

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1 1`

For this case:
- \( x = 1 \)
- \( y = 1 \)
- \( z = 1 \)

According to the problem description, if there are more than one possible outcomes due to the unknown votes, the result should be "?". However, the program checks the conditions and prints:

```python
(x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1)
if x > y + z:
    print('+')  # This condition is false
elif x < y:
    print('-')  # This condition is false
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')  # This condition is false since z != 0
    else:
        print('?')  # This condition should be true, but the program does not check it properly
else:
    print('?')  # This condition is false
```

The program incorrectly handles the condition where \( x = y \) and \( z \neq 0 \). It should print "?" in this scenario, but instead, it falls into an incorrect branch. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
