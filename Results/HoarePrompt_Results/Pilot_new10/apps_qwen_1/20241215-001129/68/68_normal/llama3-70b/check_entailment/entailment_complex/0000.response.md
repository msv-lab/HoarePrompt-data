Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three non-negative integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) from user input using `input().split()` and converts them to integers with `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If \( x > y + z \), the program prints `+`. This directly corresponds to the condition where the number of upvotes is more than the combined number of downvotes and unknown votes, resulting in a positive outcome.
   - **Case 2**: If \( x < y \), the program prints `-`. This handles the scenario where the number of downvotes is more than the number of upvotes, leading to a negative outcome.
   - **Case 3**: If \( x == y \) and \( z == 0 \), the program prints `0`. This ensures that when the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes and there are no unknown voters, the outcome is neutral (0).
   - **Case 4**: If \( x == y \) and \( z \neq 0 \), the program prints `?`. This accounts for the uncertainty when the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes, and there are unknown voters who could potentially change the outcome.
   - **Case 5**: If \( x \geq y \) but \( x \) is not necessarily greater than \( y + z \), the program prints `?`. This covers scenarios where the number of upvotes is at least equal to the number of downvotes, but it's unclear whether the unknown votes will tip the balance towards an upvote or downvote.

3. **Range Validation**: The program ensures that \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are within the specified range (0 to 100) through the input handling and logic constraints.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the logic required by the problem statement for all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
