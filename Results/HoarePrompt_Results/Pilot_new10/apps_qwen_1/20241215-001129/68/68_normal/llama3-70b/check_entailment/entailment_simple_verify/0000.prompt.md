You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > y + z:
        print('+')
    elif x < y:
        print('-')
    elif x == y:
        if z == 0:
            print('0')
        else:
            print('?')
    else:
        print('?')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider all scenarios involving the variable \( z \).

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1 1`

For this case:
- \( x = 1 \)
- \( y = 1 \)
- \( z = 1 \)

According to the problem description, if there are more than one possible outcomes due to the unknown votes, the result should be "?". However, the program checks the conditions and prints:

```python
(x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1)
if x > y + z:
    print('+')  # This condition is false
elif x < y:
    print('-')  # This condition is false
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')  # This condition is false since z != 0
    else:
        print('?')  # This condition should be true, but the program does not check it properly
else:
    print('?')  # This condition is false
```

The program incorrectly handles the condition where \( x = y \) and \( z \neq 0 \). It should print "?" in this scenario, but instead, it falls into an incorrect branch. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z) :
        print('+')
    else :
        if (x < y) :
            print('-')
        else :
            if (x == y) :
                if (z == 0) :
                    print('0')
                else :
                    print('?')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `x` and `y` are integers in the range 0 <= x, y <= 100, and `x` is equal to `y`. If `z` is 0, then no change is made to `x` and `y`. If `z` is not 0, then `x` and `y` remain equal, but this equality is already established before the if-else block executes.
            else :
                print('?')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` and `y` are integers in the range 0 <= x, y <= 100, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `z` is 0, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `z` is not 0, `x` and `y` remain equal. Regardless of the value of `z`, `x` is unchanged from its initial state.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x` and `y` are integers in the range 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` remains less than or equal to `y + z` and `x` is unchanged. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then either `x` and `y` remain equal (if `z` is 0) or `x` remains unchanged (if `z` is not 0). In both cases, `x` remains within its initial range and satisfies the condition `x <= y + z`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, then `x` remains greater than the sum of `y` and `z`. Otherwise, `x` remains less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` do not change beyond their initial ranges.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
