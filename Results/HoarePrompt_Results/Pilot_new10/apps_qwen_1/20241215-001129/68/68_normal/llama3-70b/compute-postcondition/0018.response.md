The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are mentioned in the constraints but are not passed to the function. Based on the constraints, the function should consider values of `x`, `y`, and `z` where each is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100. However, since these are not provided as function parameters, we can infer that the function might internally use these values or be defined without them.

Given the lack of return conditions in the provided output, we cannot determine the specific return value of the function. We only know the range of possible values for `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but considers non-negative integers x, y, and z within the range 0 to 100.**
