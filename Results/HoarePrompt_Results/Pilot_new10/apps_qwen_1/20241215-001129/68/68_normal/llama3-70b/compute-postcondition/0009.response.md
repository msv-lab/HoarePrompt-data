The code prints '0', which does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The initial state is that `x` and `y` are integers in the range 0 <= x, y <= 100, with x initially greater than or equal to y and now equal to y, and `z` is 0. Since printing does not change the values of variables, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, both in the range 0 <= x, y <= 100, `z` is 0**
