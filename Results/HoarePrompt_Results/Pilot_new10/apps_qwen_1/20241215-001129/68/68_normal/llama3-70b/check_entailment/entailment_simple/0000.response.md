Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down why it meets all the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) as input using `input().split()`, which matches the problem description where these values are separated by spaces and read into the variables.

2. **Determine Result Based on Conditions:**
   - The program checks various conditions to determine the result:
     - If \(x > y + z\), it prints `+` (more upvotes than downvotes).
     - If \(x < y\), it prints `-` (more downvotes than upvotes).
     - If \(x == y\):
       - If \(z == 0\), it prints `0` (exact tie with no uncertainty).
       - If \(z != 0\), it prints `?` (uncertainty due to unknown votes).
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `?` indicating uncertainty.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly:
     - When \(x > y + z\), it ensures the output is `+`.
     - When \(x < y\), it ensures the output is `-`.
     - When \(x == y\) and \(z == 0\), it ensures the output is `0`.
     - When \(x == y\) and \(z \neq 0\), it ensures the output is `?`.
     - For other cases, it ensures the output is `?`.

4. **Constraints Check:**
   - The constraints \(0 \le x, y, z \le 100\) are respected throughout the program, ensuring that all values stay within the specified range.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the correct output formats as specified in the problem statement (`+`, `-`, `0`, `?`).

Given that the annotated program correctly implements the logic and handles all edge cases as required by the problem description, the program is correct.
