Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it works as expected:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads three integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) from the standard input using `input().split()`. This handles the input as specified.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - It initializes `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` to account for the range of possible upvotes when considering the unknown votes (`z`). Similarly, it initializes `min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes` for the downvotes.
   - Specifically:
     - `min_upvotes = x`: The minimum possible upvotes is the direct count of certain upvotes.
     - `max_upvotes = x + z`: The maximum possible upvotes is the sum of certain upvotes and all unknown votes.
     - `min_downvotes = y`: The minimum possible downvotes is the direct count of certain downvotes.
     - `max_downvotes = y + z`: The maximum possible downvotes is the sum of certain downvotes and all unknown votes.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks the following conditions:
     - If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes`), then there can be no way to balance out the votes such that upvotes are more than downvotes. Hence, the result is `"-"`.
     - If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`), then there can be no way to balance out the votes such that downvotes are more than upvotes. Hence, the result is `"+"`.

4. **Uncertainty Condition**:
   - If neither of the above conditions holds, it means there could be multiple outcomes depending on how the unknown votes (`z`) are distributed. In this case, the program prints `"?"` indicating the result is uncertain.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases appropriately. For instance:
     - If \( x = 1 \), \( y = 1 \), and \( z = 0 \), the output is `"0"`.
     - If \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( z = 1 \), the output is `"?"`.

The program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement, ensuring it provides the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
