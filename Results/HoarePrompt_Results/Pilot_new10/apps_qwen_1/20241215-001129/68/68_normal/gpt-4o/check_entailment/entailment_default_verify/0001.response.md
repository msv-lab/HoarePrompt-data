Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It handles all potential cases:
- Determines the range of possible upvotes and downvotes.
- Compares these ranges to decide the output.
- Prints `?` if there is uncertainty, which aligns with the problem description.

The output hints accurately reflect the functionality of the program. They describe the conditions under which the program prints `-`, `+`, or `?`, which matches the logic implemented in the code. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
