The code snippet `print('+')` prints the character '+' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and `(max_upvotes >= min_downvotes)`. Additionally, `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`.**
