`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The value of `y` is an integer between 0 and 100. The values of `x`, `z`, and `max_upvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`**
