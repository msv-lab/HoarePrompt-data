The code `print('?')` simply prints a question mark to the console without changing any of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and `(max_downvotes < min_upvotes)` is false**
