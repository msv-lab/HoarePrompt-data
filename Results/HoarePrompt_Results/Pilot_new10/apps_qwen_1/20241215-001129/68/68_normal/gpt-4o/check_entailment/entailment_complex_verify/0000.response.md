Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the original assessment. The program correctly handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Correct Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - If \(x > y + z\), the maximum number of upvotes (\(x + z\)) will always be greater than the minimum number of downvotes (\(y\)), resulting in a print of "+".
   - If \(y > x + z\), the maximum number of downvotes (\(y + z\)) will always be greater than the minimum number of upvotes (\(x\)), resulting in a print of "-".
   - If neither of the above conditions hold, the result is uncertain ("?"), which is correctly handled by checking if the ranges overlap.

2. **State Transitions:**
   - The program initializes `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` correctly based on the input values.
   - The if-else blocks check these ranges and print the appropriate result based on the conditions.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all edge cases as described, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
