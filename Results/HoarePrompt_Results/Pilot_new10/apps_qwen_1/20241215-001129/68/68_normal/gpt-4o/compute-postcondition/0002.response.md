The code sets `max_upvotes` to the value of `x + z`. The initial value of `x` is an integer between 0 and 100, and the initial value of `z` is an integer between 0 and 100. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will be the sum of these two values. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`**
