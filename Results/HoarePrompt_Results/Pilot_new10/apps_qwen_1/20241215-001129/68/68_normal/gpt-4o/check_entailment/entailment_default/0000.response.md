Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the conditions for determining the result are incomplete. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If \( x + z \geq y \) and \( y + z \geq x \), the result is `"0"`.
   - If \( x + z < y \), the result is `"-"`.
   - If \( y + z < x \), the result is `"+"`.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The current implementation checks:
     - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'`.
     - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `'?'`.

3. **Missing Case**:
   - The condition `if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:` correctly handles the case where the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum possible downvotes.
   - The condition `elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:` correctly handles the case where the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum possible upvotes.
   - However, the missing case is when the number of possible upvotes and downvotes overlap, i.e., \( x + z \geq y \) and \( y + z \geq x \). In this case, the result is `"0"`, but the current implementation does not handle this scenario.

For example, consider the input `(2, 1, 1)`:
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( y = 1 \)
- \( z = 1 \)

- Maximum possible upvotes: \( x + z = 3 \)
- Minimum possible downvotes: \( y = 1 \)
- Maximum possible downvotes: \( y + z = 2 \)
- Minimum possible upvotes: \( x = 2 \)

Here, \( x + z \geq y \) (3 >= 1) and \( y + z \geq x \) (2 >= 2), so the result should be `"0"`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly print `'?'`.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases and hence the correctness is **False**.
