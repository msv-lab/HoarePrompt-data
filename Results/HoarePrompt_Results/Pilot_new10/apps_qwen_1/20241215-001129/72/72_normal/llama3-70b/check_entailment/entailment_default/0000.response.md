Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly simulate the process of the teacher asking pupils in the described order. The output hints suggest that the code calculates the number of questions asked to each pupil using a simplified formula, but this approach fails to accurately represent the complex ordering pattern described in the problem.

For instance, the code calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked using a linear approximation, which does not account for the back-and-forth nature of the questioning. Additionally, the calculation for how many times the teacher asked Sergei is also oversimplified and does not reflect the actual sequence of questions.

To properly solve this problem, one would need to simulate the exact sequence of questions based on the given row and column positions, which is not done in the current implementation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
