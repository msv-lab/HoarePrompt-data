The code reads five integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. These values replace the original values of the variables, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer; 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`, 1 ≤ `y` ≤ `m`.**
