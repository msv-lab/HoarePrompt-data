Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle the case when the total number of questions `k` is less than the number of pupils `n * m`. The annotated version of the code confirms this issue. Specifically, the calculation of `max_asked` and `min_asked` does not account for incomplete cycles properly. The corrected version provided in the explanation correctly handles both full cycles and remaining questions, ensuring accurate results for all potential cases. The original program's approach is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs for smaller values of `k`.
