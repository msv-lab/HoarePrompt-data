`max_questions` is incremented by 1, which means it now holds a value that is 1 more than its previous value. The conditions related to `remaining_questions`, `m`, and `col` are checked based on the value of `direction`, `row`, and `x`, `y`. However, since the code does not depend on these conditions, the values of `remaining_questions`, `m`, and `col` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 0, and `max_questions` is increased by 1.**
