Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, and `col` is 1. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise unchanged; `row` is decreased by 2 if `row` equals `n`. Otherwise, `max_questions` is reduced by 1, `row` is either `x + 3` (if `row == -1` is true) or `row + direction` (if `row == -1` is false), `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 if `row + direction == x` and `col == y`, and `direction` is set to 1.***
