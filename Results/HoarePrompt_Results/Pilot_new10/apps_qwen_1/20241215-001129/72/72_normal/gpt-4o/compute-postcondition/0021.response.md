To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the `for` loop and their initial values. The loop iterates over the range of `m`, meaning `col` will take on values from 0 to `m-1`.

The key variable here is `col`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `col` should start at 0, and `m` should be at least 1.

Let's go through the given initial states and see what needs to be adjusted:

1. **`n` is an integer greater than 1**: This state remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop execution directly.
2. **`m` is an integer**: We need to ensure `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
3. **`k` is an integer**: This state remains unchanged.
4. **`full_cycle_length` is \((2 * n - 2) * m\)**: This state remains unchanged.
5. **`full_cycles` is \(k // full_cycle_length\)**: This state remains unchanged.
6. **`remaining_questions` is \(k \% full_cycle_length\) and must be greater than 0**: This state remains unchanged.
7. **`min_questions` is \((k // full_cycle_length) // (2 * n - 2)\)**: This state remains unchanged.
8. **`max_questions` is \((k // full_cycle_length + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)\)**: This state remains unchanged.
9. **`sergei_questions` is either \(full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)\) if \(x\) is either 0 or \(n - 1\), otherwise \(full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles \% (2 * n - 2) >= x)\)**: This state remains unchanged.
10. **`direction` is 1**: This state remains unchanged.
11. **`row` is 0**: This state remains unchanged.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is `m` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`m` must be at least 1**
