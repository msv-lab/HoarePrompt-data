`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The initial state is that `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`. The condition `row == x and col == y` does not affect the value of `sergei_questions` since the code `max_questions -= 1` only impacts `max_questions`.

Output State: **`row` is equal to `x`; `col` is equal to `y`; `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`**
