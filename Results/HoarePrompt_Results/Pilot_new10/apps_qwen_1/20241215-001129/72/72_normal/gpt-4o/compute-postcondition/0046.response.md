The code `row -= 2` decrements the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state where `row` is incremented by `direction` (which is -1), the initial value of `row` would be `m - 1`. Decrementing this value by 2 results in `row` being `m - 3`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1; `row` is `m - 3`; `col` is `col_end + 1`; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `sergei_questions` and `col_end` are unchanged; `direction` is -1.**
