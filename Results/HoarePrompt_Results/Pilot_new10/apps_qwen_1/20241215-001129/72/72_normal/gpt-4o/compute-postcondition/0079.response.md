`row` is decremented by 2. Given the initial state, the value of `row` is equal to `n`. So, after decrementing by 2, `row` becomes `n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`col` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `row` is `n - 2`, `max_questions` is the original value plus 1, `sergei_questions` is the number of times `row == x and col == y` is true during the iterations where `direction == 1` plus 1 (if the condition `row == x and col == y` is met), `remaining_questions` is 1, and `direction` is -1.**
