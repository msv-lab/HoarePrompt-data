Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `row` and `col` are coordinates, `max_questions` and `sergei_questions` are counters. If `direction == 1` and `row == x + 1` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 and `max_questions` is incremented by 1. If `row == n`, then `direction` is set to `-1`; otherwise, `direction` remains unchanged. If `direction != 1`, then `row` is reset to 1, `direction` is set to 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.***
