Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads five integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), \( x \), and \( y \) from the input.
   - It adjusts \( x \) and \( y \) to zero-based indices since Python uses zero-based indexing.

2. **Cycle Calculation:**
   - The full cycle length is calculated as \((2 * n - 2) * m\) if \( n > 1 \), otherwise, it's just \( m \).
   - The number of full cycles (\( full_cycles \)) and the remaining questions (\( remaining_questions \)) are computed.

3. **Initial Minimum and Maximum Questions Calculation:**
   - The initial minimum and maximum number of questions are set based on the number of full cycles.
   - If \( n > 1 \), these values are further refined to account for the changing direction of the polling.

4. **Sergei’s Questions Calculation:**
   - The number of questions Sergei is asked is calculated by considering both full cycles and the remaining questions.
   - The logic ensures that the calculation accounts for the direction change when reaching the end of a row.

5. **Polling Simulation:**
   - A nested loop simulates the polling process, incrementing the count for Sergei if he is asked, and updating the maximum number of questions based on the current direction.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum number of questions any pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions any pupil is asked, and the number of questions Sergei is asked.

### Key Points Addressed:

- **Order of Asking Pupils:**
  - The program correctly handles the alternating direction of polling between rows.
  - The logic for determining which pupils are asked and how many times they are asked aligns with the problem description.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case when there is only one row (\( n = 1 \)).
  - It correctly calculates the number of full cycles and remaining questions, ensuring the simulation stops when all questions are accounted for.

- **Sergei’s Position:**
  - The program correctly calculates how many times Sergei is asked based on his position in the row and the overall polling pattern.

Since the program accurately follows the problem description for all cases, the output will be correct for any valid input within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
