`y` is decremented by 1. The initial state shows that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` are assigned values from the input split by spaces, and `x` is one less than its original value. After executing `y -= 1`, the value of `y` is updated by subtracting 1 from its original value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `y` is one less than its original value, `x` is one less than its original value**
