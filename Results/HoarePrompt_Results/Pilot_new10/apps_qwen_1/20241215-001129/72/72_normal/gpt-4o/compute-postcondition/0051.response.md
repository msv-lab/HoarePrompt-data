The code `row += 2` increments the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state, `row` was originally incremented by 1, so now it is incremented by another 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `row` is the original value of `row + 1 + 2`, `col` and `col_end` are coordinates, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` is unchanged, `col` is `col_end + 1`.**
