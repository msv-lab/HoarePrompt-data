Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the described problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Full Cycles and Remaining Questions:**
   - The formula for `full_cycle_length` is almost correct but should account for the fact that the teacher asks the last row twice in the first cycle if `n > 1`.
   - The calculation of `full_cycles` and `remaining_questions` seems overly complex and might not handle all edge cases correctly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Questions per Pupil:**
   - The initial calculation of `min_questions` and `max_questions` does not account for the specific position of the rows being asked in each cycle.
   - The logic for updating `sergei_questions` is flawed. It should correctly account for the direction and the position of Sergei in the cycle.

3. **Direction Handling in the Main Loop:**
   - The handling of the direction (`direction = 1` for asking from top to bottom and `-1` for asking from bottom to top) and the logic to update the row index are incorrect.
   - The conditions for changing direction and updating the row index are not properly handled, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4 2 9 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 1 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 1 1
```

This example seems to work correctly, but let's consider another case to ensure the code handles all scenarios correctly:

**Input:**
```
3 3 10 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 1 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 1 2
```

This example also seems to work correctly. However, the code does not handle all edge cases properly. For instance, consider the case where the number of questions `k` is very large, and the position of Sergei is at the end of the last row.

**Input:**
```
100 100 1000000000000000000 100 100
```

The expected output should be:
```
101010101010101 50505050505051 50505050505051
```

However, the actual output from the provided code might not be correct due to the way the cycles are calculated and the direction handling.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is **incorrect**.
