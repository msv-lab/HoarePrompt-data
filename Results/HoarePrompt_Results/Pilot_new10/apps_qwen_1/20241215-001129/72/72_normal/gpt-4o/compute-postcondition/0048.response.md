`max_questions` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `max_questions` before the operation is unknown. The states of other variables are not affected, so they remain as in the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `row` and `col` are coordinates, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` is unchanged, `col` is `col_end + 1`, and if `row == x` and `col == y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.**
