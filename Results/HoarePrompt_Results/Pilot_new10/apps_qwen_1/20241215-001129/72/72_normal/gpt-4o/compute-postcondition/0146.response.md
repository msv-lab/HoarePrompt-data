`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The values of `remaining_questions`, `m`, `row`, `col`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: *`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` ≥ 1, and `col` is 1; `max_questions` is reduced by 1; `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` implies `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 otherwise no change.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` ≥ 1, and `col` is 1; `max_questions` is reduced by 1; `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` implies `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1 otherwise no change.**
