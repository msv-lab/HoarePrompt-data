`row` is decreased by 2. Initially, `row` is equal to `x + -1`, which simplifies to `x - 1`. After subtracting 2 from `row`, the new value of `row` is `(x - 1) - 2`, which simplifies to `x - 3`. The values of `col`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`row` is `x - 3`, `col` is `y`, `sergei_questions` is unchanged, `max_questions` is increased by 1**
