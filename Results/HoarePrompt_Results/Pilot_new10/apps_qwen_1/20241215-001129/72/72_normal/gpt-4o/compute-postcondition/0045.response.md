`direction` is reassigned to -1, changing its value from its previous state. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is at least 1; `row` is incremented by `direction`; `col` is `col_end + 1`; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `sergei_questions` and `col_end` are unchanged; `direction` is -1.
