`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the current value of `row` is equal to `x` and the current value of `col` is equal to `y` is false. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the current value of `row` is equal to `x` and the current value of `col` is equal to `y` is false, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`.**
