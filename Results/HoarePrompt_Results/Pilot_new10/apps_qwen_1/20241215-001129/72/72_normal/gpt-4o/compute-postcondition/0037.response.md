`row` is incremented by 2. Since `row` was initially -1, the new value of `row` will be -1 + 2, which is 1. The values of `m`, `col`, `max_questions`, and `sergei_questions` remain unchanged, and `direction` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `row` is 1, `col` is `y`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged; `direction` is 1.**
