The code sets the variable `direction` to `-1`. This does not affect the values of `remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, `max_questions`, `row`, `x`, `y`, or `sergei_questions` directly. The only change is the assignment of `-1` to `direction`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is -1, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `remaining_questions`, `m`, and `col` remain unchanged; `row` is increased by -1.**
