The code `n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads five space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. Since the input is in the form of integers, the variables will be updated accordingly. However, the exact values of these integers are not specified in the initial state, so we will keep the variables in their general forms.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers; `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**
