`sergei_questions` is assigned the value of `min_questions`. The value of `min_questions` is given by the expression `(k // full_cycle_length) // (2 * n - 2)`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is `(k // full_cycle_length) // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is `(k // full_cycle_length + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`, `sergei_questions` is `(k // full_cycle_length) // (2 * n - 2)`**
