`direction` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables (`max_questions`, `row`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is equal to `x + 1`, `col` is equal to `y`, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is equal to `x + 1`, `col` is equal to `y`, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
