The code `full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length` calculates the integer division of `k` by `full_cycle_length`. The value of `full_cycle_length` is defined as `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`. 

Since `n` and `m` are integers and their specific values are not given, we'll keep them in the expression. `k` is also an integer, but its specific value is not provided, so we'll keep it as `k`.

- The value of `n` does not change.
- The value of `m` does not change.
- The value of `k` does not change.
- `full_cycle_length` remains as `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`.
- `full_cycles` is now the integer division of `k` by `full_cycle_length`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length`**
