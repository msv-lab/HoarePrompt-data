Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, and `col` is 0. If `direction == 1` and `row == n`, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is set to `n-2`, and `direction` is set to -1. If `direction == 1` and `row != n`, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is incremented by `direction`, and `col` remains 0. If `direction == -1` and `sergi_questions` is not incremented, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row == x` and `col == y`. If `row == -1`, then `row` is set to 1; otherwise, `row` is incremented by `direction`, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1.***

This postcondition summarizes all the possible outcomes of the if-else block based on the given conditions and postconditions for both parts.
