`max_questions` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`remaining_questions`, `m`, `col`, `row`, `x`, `y`, and `sergei_questions`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` > 1, `m` ≥ 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and the condition for increasing `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` ≥ 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and the condition for increasing `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
