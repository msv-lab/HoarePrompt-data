Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is `(k // full_cycle_length) // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is `(k // full_cycle_length + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes. Since the else part is not provided and no operations are performed when the condition `n > 1` is false, the variables remain as defined in the if part of the condition.
