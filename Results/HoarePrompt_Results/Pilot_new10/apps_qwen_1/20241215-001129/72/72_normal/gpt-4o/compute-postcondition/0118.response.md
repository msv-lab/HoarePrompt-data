To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the logic of the for loop.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for _ in range(remaining_questions):`
- This means the loop will iterate `remaining_questions` times.
- We need to know the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the loop uses `range(remaining_questions)`, the loop counter (the underscore `_`) will take values from 0 to `remaining_questions - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations remaining should be at least 1.

Let's denote:
- `remaining_questions` as the number of iterations left before the loop ends.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- If `remaining_questions` was greater than 0, then the loop will continue.
- After one iteration, `remaining_questions` will be reduced by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0 and will become `remaining_questions - 1`.

Since we don't have specific variable names like `total` or `students_list` mentioned, we'll focus on the core variables related to the loop execution.

State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1**

This ensures that there is at least one more iteration left for the loop to execute.
