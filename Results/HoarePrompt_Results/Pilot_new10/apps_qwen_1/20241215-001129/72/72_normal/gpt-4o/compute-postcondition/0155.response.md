`max_questions` is incremented by 1. The values of `remaining_questions`, `m`, and `col` remain unchanged. The condition `if row == x and col == y` does not affect the value of `sergei_questions` since it is not specified whether `row == x and col == y` is true or false. Therefore, the value of `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` > 1, `m` â‰¥ 1, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1, and `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
