The code `a = b ^ x` assigns the value of `b` XOR `x` to `a`. However, there is no initial value given for `b`. Since `b` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Thus, `a` will be the result of the XOR operation between `b` and `x`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-negative integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12, `a` is the result of `b` XOR `x`.**
