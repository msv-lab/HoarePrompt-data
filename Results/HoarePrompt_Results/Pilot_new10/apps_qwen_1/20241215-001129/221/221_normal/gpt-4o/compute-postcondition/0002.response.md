The function `func` accepts two parameters: `s` and `x`. Both `s` and `x` are non-negative integers with the constraint that `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. 

Case_1: `s` is a non-negative integer such that `2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12` and `x` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12`. The function does not return any specific value or message based on the given constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `s` and `x`, where `s` is a non-negative integer within the range `[2, 10^12]` and `x` is a non-negative integer within the range `[0, 10^12]`, without returning any specific value or message.
