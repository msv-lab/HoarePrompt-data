#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are non-negative integers such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:Let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
```

### Return Postconditions:
- The function does not explicitly return anything.
- The function accepts two parameters `s` and `x`, both of which are non-negative integers with the constraints \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\) and \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{12}\).
- The function modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The function does not take any parameters, so we assume `a` and `b` are already defined and initialized somewhere outside the function.
2. **First Line**: `a = b ^ x`
   - This line computes the bitwise XOR of `b` and `x` and assigns the result to `a`.
3. **Second Line**: `b = a ^ x`
   - This line computes the bitwise XOR of `a` (which now holds the result of `b ^ x`) and `x` and assigns the result back to `b`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function does not return any value, but it modifies `a` and `b` based on the given `x`.
- The initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the annotated code or the return postconditions.
- There are no constraints or checks on the initial values of `a` and `b`.

### Summary:
The function `func` takes no explicit parameters but modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations with the value `x`. The function does not return any value.

### Final Functionality Summary:
**The function modifies the variables `a` and `b` using bitwise XOR operations with the value `x` and does not return any value.**
