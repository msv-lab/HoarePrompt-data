The code `b = a ^ x` updates the value of `b` to be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `x`. The values of `s` and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `b` is now `a ^ x`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-negative integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12, `a` is the result of `b` XOR `x`, `b` is `a ^ x`**
