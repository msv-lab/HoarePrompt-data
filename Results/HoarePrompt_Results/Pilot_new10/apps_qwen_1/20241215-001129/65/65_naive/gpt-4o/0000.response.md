Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether Kefa can distribute all balloons among his friends such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` and the string `s` representing the colors of the balloons.
2. **Color Counting**: It accurately counts the occurrences of each color using a dictionary `color_count`.
3. **Distribution Check**: It checks if the count of any color exceeds the number of friends `k`. If it does, it sets `can_distribute` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
4. **Output**: Based on the value of `can_distribute`, it prints either "YES" or "NO".

Given the examples and the problem description, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements based on the provided logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
