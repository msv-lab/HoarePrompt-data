Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), and `color_count` is a dictionary. If the character `c` is already in `color_count`, its count is incremented by 1. If `c` is not in `color_count`, it is added with a count of 1.***
