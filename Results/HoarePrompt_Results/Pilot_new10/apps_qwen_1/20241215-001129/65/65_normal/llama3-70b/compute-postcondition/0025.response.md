Functionality: **The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `s`. It reads `n` and `k` from input, where both are non-negative integers between 1 and 100, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons. It then counts the frequency of each color in the string `s`. Finally, it checks if the maximum frequency of any color in `s` is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
