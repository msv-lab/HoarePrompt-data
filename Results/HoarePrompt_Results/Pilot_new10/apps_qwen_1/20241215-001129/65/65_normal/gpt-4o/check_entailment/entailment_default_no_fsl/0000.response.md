Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It counts the occurrences of each color in the string and checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that the balloons can be distributed without any friend getting two balloons of the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This logic ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement and examples provided.
