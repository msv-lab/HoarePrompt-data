The function `func` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (both within the range of 1 to 100) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters representing the colors of the balloons. The function processes the string `s` to count the occurrences of each color and then checks if it is possible to distribute the colors such that no color appears more than `k` times. If such a distribution is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

From the code, it is clear that the function does not actually return anything; instead, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' directly. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need to be covered as the logic provided handles all valid inputs within the specified range.
