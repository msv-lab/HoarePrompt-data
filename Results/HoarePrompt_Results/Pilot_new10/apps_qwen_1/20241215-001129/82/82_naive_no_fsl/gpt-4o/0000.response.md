Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The program uses `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and `func_2` to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) using the relationship between GCD and LCM. This part is correct.

2. **Optimization Strategy**: The program calculates the difference between \( a \) and \( b \) and iterates over possible values of \( k \) up to the square root of this difference. For each candidate \( k \), it calculates the new values \( a' = (a + k - 1) // k * k \) and \( b' = (b + k - 1) // k * k \). These calculations ensure that \( a' \) and \( b' \) are multiples of \( k \), making the LCM calculation straightforward.

3. **Minimizing LCM**: The program keeps track of the minimum LCM found and updates the corresponding \( k \) value. This ensures that the smallest \( k \) is chosen when multiple \( k \) values result in the same minimal LCM.

Given these points, the program correctly handles all the examples provided and does not exhibit any errors or omissions in the logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
