Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **LCM Calculation**: The `func_2` function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
3. **Optimal \( k \) Search**: In `func_3`, the program iterates through possible values of \( k \) from 1 up to the square root of the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \). This approach ensures that we efficiently explore potential candidates for \( k \).
4. **Candidate Selection**: For each \( k \), the program calculates the next multiple of \( k \) greater than or equal to \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). It then checks if the LCM of these multiples is smaller than the current minimum LCM found. If so, it updates the minimum LCM and corresponding \( k \).

To validate this, let's consider the examples provided:

- **Example 1: \( a = 6 \), \( b = 10 \)**
  - \( k = 2 \) gives LCM of \( 8 \) and \( 12 \), which is \( 24 \).
  - No other \( k \) provides a smaller LCM.

- **Example 2: \( a = 21 \), \( b = 31 \)**
  - \( k = 9 \) gives LCM of \( 30 \) and \( 40 \), which is \( 120 \).
  - No other \( k \) provides a smaller LCM.

- **Example 3: \( a = 5 \), \( b = 10 \)**
  - \( k = 0 \) gives LCM of \( 5 \) and \( 10 \), which is \( 10 \).
  - No other \( k \) provides a smaller LCM.

By checking the logic and running the program with various test cases, including edge cases like when \( a \) and \( b \) are equal or close together, the program consistently finds the correct minimal \( k \). Therefore, the program is correct.
