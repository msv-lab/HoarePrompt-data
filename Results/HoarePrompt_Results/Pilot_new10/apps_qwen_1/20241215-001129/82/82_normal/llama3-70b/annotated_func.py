#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'a' is the GCD of the original values of 'a' and 'b', 'b' is 0
    return a
    #The program returns 'a' which is the GCD of the original values of 'a' and 'b', and 'b' is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, both within the range of \(1\) to \(10^9\), and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the Euclidean algorithm, `a` contains the GCD, and `b` is set to `0`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\), and gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns the result of \((a * b) // \text{gcd}(a, b)\). This calculation effectively simplifies the product of `a` and `b` by their greatest common divisor. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code performs the intended operation without any additional checks or modifications.
