The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0 after the calculation.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers between 1 and \(10^9\), and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.**
