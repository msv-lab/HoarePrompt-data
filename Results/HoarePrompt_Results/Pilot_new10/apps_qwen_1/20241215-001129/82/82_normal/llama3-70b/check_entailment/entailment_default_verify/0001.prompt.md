You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it uses a brute-force approach to find the smallest \( k \) by incrementing \( k \) from 0 and checking each value until it finds the minimum LCM. However, this approach is inefficient and may not terminate within a reasonable time for large inputs.

Consider the following case:

- Input: \( a = 1000000000 \) and \( b = 1000000000 \)

For this input, the program will increment \( k \) from 0 upwards, and since \( a \) and \( b \) are very large, the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) will also be very large initially. This means the loop will take a long time to terminate, and it might not find the correct answer within a practical time frame.

Moreover, the program does not guarantee finding the optimal \( k \) efficiently. A more efficient approach would be to consider the properties of LCM and GCD, but the current implementation does not address these properties effectively.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle large inputs efficiently and does not guarantee finding the correct \( k \) within a reasonable time.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, both within the range of \(1\) to \(10^9\), and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the Euclidean algorithm, `a` contains the GCD, and `b` is set to `0`. 

Output hint for function_2: The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns the result of \((a * b) // \text{gcd}(a, b)\). This calculation effectively simplifies the product of `a` and `b` by their greatest common divisor. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code performs the intended operation without any additional checks or modifications. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
