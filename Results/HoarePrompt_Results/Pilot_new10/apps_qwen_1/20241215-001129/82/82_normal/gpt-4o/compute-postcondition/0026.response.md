The code updates the value of `current_lcm` to the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The function `func_2` is not defined, but the value of `new_a` and `new_b` is derived from `a` and `b` using the formula `(value + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Given the initial state:
- `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `a` is its original value
- `candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`
- `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `current_lcm` remains unchanged
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged

After executing the line:
```
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

The value of `current_lcm` is updated to the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, but the values of `a`, `candidate`, `new_b`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `a` is its original value; `candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`; `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.**
