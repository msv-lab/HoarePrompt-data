The code updates the variable `min_lcm` to the value of `current_lcm`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Let's summarize the changes:

- `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`new_a` is \(((a + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + c - 1) // c * c\); `new_b` is \((b + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is now `current_lcm`, `min_k` remains the same, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 1`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.**
