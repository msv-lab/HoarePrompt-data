In the given code snippet, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The function `func_2` is not defined, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, we know that `new_a` and `new_b` are derived from `a` and `b` respectively, by rounding them up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `b` is updated to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `diff` is positive and divisible by `k`
- `k` is at least 1
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged unless updated in the loop body.

The values of `a` and `b` are now rounded up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`. Since `current_lcm` is set to the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, it means that `current_lcm` could be any value depending on the implementation of `func_2`.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is updated to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `diff` is positive and divisible by `k`, `k` is at least 1, `min_lcm` is the same, `min_k` is the same unless updated in the loop body, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
