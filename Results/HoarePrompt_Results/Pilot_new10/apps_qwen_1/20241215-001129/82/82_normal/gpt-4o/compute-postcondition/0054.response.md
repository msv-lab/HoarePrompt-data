Postcondition: ***`a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `diff` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `min_lcm` remains the same unless `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), in which case `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `new_b` is updated to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), and `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`***
