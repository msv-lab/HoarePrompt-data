Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be accurate. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read from standard input and split into two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The program correctly handles the constraints \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\).

2. **GCD Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.
   - The annotation accurately describes the state of the program after the loop, where `x` holds the GCD and `y` is 0.

3. **LCM Calculation (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the LCM using the relationship \( \text{LCM}(x, y) = \frac{x \times y}{\text{GCD}(x, y)} \).
   - The annotation correctly describes the state of the program after the calculation.

4. **Optimal \(k\) Search (`func_3`)**:
   - The function `func_3` iterates over possible values of \(k\) from 1 to the square root of the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\).
   - For each \(k\), it calculates the next multiple of \(k\) greater than or equal to \(a + k\) and \(b + k\).
   - It then checks if the calculated LCM is smaller than the current minimum LCM or if it is equal but the candidate \(k\) is smaller.
   - The annotation accurately describes the state of the program after each iteration and the final return statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \(a = b\) by returning 0.
   - The search strategy ensures that the smallest \(k\) is found, and the annotation correctly reflects this process.

Given the detailed annotations and the correctness of the logic described in the code, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate. The program correctly finds the smallest non-negative integer \(k\) such that the LCM of \(a + k\) and \(b + k\) is minimized.
