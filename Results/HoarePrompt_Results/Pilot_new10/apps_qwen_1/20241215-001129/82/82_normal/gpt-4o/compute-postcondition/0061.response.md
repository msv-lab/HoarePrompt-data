`current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Here, `new_a` and `new_b` are derived from `a` and `b` respectively. 

From the initial state:
- `a` is updated to \(((a + k - 1) // k * k + c - 1) // c * c\)
- `b` is updated to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `diff` is positive and divisible by `k + 1`
- `k` is the next value after being incremented by 1
- `min_lcm` is the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions
- `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated
- `diff // k` must be a positive integer.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `candidate`, and `k` are not specified, we can only say that `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on the formulas given. The function `func_2` will take these new values and compute the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`.

The states of `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `diff`, and `k` remain unchanged unless `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm`, in which case `min_lcm` would be updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` would be updated to the current `candidate`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `new_a` is \(((a + k - 1) // k * k + c - 1) // c * c\)
- `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`
- `min_lcm` remains the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions
- `min_k` remains the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated
- `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 1`
- `k` remains the next value after being incremented by 1
- `diff // k` remains a positive integer.

Output State: **`new_a` is \(((a + k - 1) // k * k + c - 1) // c * c\); `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` remains the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions, `min_k` remains the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 1`, `k` remains the next value after being incremented by 1, `diff // k` remains a positive integer.**
