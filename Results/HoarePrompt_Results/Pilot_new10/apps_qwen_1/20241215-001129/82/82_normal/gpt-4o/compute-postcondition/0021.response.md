The code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. This means `min_k` now holds the value of `candidate`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `a` is its original value; `candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`; `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
