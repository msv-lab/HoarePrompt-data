Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` are as follows: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\), \(1 \le b \le 10^9\), and \(a \neq b\). `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is a perfect square. `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple (LCM) found so far, initialized to infinity. `min_k` is the factor corresponding to the smallest LCM. If `diff % k == 0`, then `k` and `diff // k` are factors of `diff` that lead to the smallest `lcm`, which is updated to `min_lcm`. `min_k` is set to `k` if this condition holds. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
