The code `min_k = candidate` assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`new_a` is \(((a + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + c - 1) // c * c\); `new_b` is \((b + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` remains the same, `min_k` is `candidate`, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 1`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.**
