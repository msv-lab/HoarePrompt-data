The code updates the variable `min_lcm` to the value of `current_lcm`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `a` remains the same
- `b` remains the same
- `diff` remains the same
- `k` remains the same
- `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`
- `min_k` remains the same
- `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`

Output State: **`a` remains the same; `b` remains the same; `diff` remains the same; `k` remains the same; `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` remains the same; `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
