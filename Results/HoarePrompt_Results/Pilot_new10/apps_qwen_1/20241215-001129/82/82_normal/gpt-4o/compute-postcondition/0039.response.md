The code sets `min_k` to the value of `candidate`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `min_k` and retains the values of all other variables as per the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `b` is updated to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `diff` is positive and divisible by `k`, `k` is at least 1, `min_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is `candidate`, `current_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
