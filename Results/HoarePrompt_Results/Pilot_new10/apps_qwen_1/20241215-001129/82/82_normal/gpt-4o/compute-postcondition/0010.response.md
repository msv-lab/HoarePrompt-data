`new_b` is assigned the value \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). The value of `b` and `candidate` remains unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the new value of `new_b` is derived from the expression given. The initial state of `new_a` is unchanged.

Output State: **`new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` is its original value, `candidate` is its original value, and `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)**.
