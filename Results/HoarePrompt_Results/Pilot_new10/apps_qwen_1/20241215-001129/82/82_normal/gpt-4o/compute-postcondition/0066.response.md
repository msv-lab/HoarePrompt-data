To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions within the for loop and how they affect the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `new_a = (((a + k - 1) // k * k + c - 1) // c * c)`
   - `new_b = ((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`
   - `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`
   - `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`.
   - `min_k` is updated to the current `candidate` value if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`.
   - `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 1`.
   - `k` is the next value after being incremented by 1.
   - `diff // k` remains a positive integer.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`.

3. **Key Points for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `k` is incremented by 1, the next value for `candidate` in the loop will be either `k + 1` or `diff // (k + 1)`, depending on which one is included in the range.
   - `current_lcm` and `min_lcm` should be re-evaluated based on the new `candidate` value.
   - `min_k` should be updated if the new `current_lcm` is smaller or equal to `min_lcm` with a smaller `candidate` value.
   - `diff` should remain positive and divisible by `k + 1`.
   - `diff // (k + 1)` should remain a positive integer.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:

- `new_a` and `new_b` will be recalculated with the new `candidate` value.
- `current_lcm` will be the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` with the new `candidate` value.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated if necessary.
- `k` will be incremented by 1, so the next value is `k + 1`.
- `diff` should remain positive and divisible by `k + 1`.
- `diff // (k + 1)` should remain a positive integer.

Given these points, the state for the next iteration would be:

**State: `new_a` is \(((a + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + c - 1) // c * c\); `new_b` is \((b + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1)\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 1`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.**
