The code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` remains the same; `b` remains the same; `diff` remains the same; `k` remains the same; `min_lcm` is now equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`; `new_a` is equal to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
