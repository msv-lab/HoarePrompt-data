`diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), the value of `diff` will be a positive integer less than or equal to \(10^9\). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\); `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\); `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.**
