To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and the loop itself.

### Given Conditions:
- `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\).
- `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\).
- `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and must be a perfect square.
- `min_lcm` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`).
- `min_k` is `0`.
- `k` is `1`.
- `diff` is divisible by `k`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization:**
   - The loop iterates over two candidates: `k` and `diff // k`.
   - For the loop to execute, both `k` and `diff // k` must be valid candidates to iterate over.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `k` is initially `1`.
   - `diff // k` is `diff // 1`, which simplifies to `diff`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop:**
   - Since `k` is `1`, it is always a valid candidate.
   - For `diff // k` to be a valid candidate, `diff // 1` must be an integer (which it always is since `diff` is an integer).

4. **Additional Constraints:**
   - `diff` must be a perfect square.
   - `diff` must be divisible by `k`. Since `k` is `1`, this condition is trivially satisfied.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `diff` is a valid candidate, i.e., `diff` must be a perfect square and should be checked if it meets the criteria in the loop body.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial values and the conditions, the loop will always execute because `k` is `1` and `diff // k` simplifies to `diff`, which is a perfect square and divisible by `1`.

### Final State:
Since all the necessary conditions are already met and the loop will always execute based on the given values, no additional state adjustments are needed beyond what is already provided.

**Final State:**
State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\), `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and must be a perfect square, `min_lcm` is infinity (`float('inf')`), `min_k` is `0`, `k` is `1`, and `diff` is divisible by `k`**.
