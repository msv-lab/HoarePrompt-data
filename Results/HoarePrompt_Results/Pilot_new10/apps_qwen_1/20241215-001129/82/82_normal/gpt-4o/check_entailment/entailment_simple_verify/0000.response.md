Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the provided annotated code and the original assessment, the program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. The annotations confirm that the program correctly handles the calculation of GCD, LCM, and the search for the optimal \( k \) as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate because the code logic aligns with the requirements and examples provided.
