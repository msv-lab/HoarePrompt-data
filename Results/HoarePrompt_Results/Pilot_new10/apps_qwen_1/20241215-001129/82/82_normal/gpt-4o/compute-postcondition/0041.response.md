Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` and `b` are updated to \((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) and \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\) respectively.
   - `diff` is positive and divisible by `k`.
   - `k` is at least 1.
   - `min_lcm` is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
   - `min_k` is `candidate` if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`). Otherwise, `min_k` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the values `[k, diff // k]`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the next candidate value from the list `[k, diff // k]`.
   - Since the loop has just completed an iteration, the next candidate value will be the remaining value in the list after the current candidate.

5. **Determine the Next Candidate:**
   - If the current candidate was `k`, the next candidate will be `diff // k`.
   - If the current candidate was `diff // k`, the next candidate will be `k`.

6. **Update the States:**
   - `a` and `b` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `diff` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (it is not updated inside the loop).
   - `k` remains the same (it is not updated inside the loop).
   - `min_lcm` remains the same (it is not updated inside the loop).
   - `min_k` will update based on the new candidate value:
     - If the new candidate is `k`, `min_k` will be updated if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `k < min_k`).
     - If the new candidate is `diff // k`, `min_k` will be updated if `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `diff // k < min_k`).

Given this analysis, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `diff` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `min_lcm` remains the same.
- `min_k` will be updated based on the new candidate value.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, and `min_lcm` are not provided, we cannot specify them explicitly. However, the structure of the states can be described as follows:

**State:**
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `diff` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `min_lcm` remains the same.
- `min_k` will be updated based on the new candidate value.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `diff` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `min_lcm` remains the same, `min_k` will be updated based on the new candidate value**.
