The code updates the value of `new_b` to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). According to the initial state, `new_b` was already equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\). Therefore, the value of `new_b` does not change and remains the same as before.

The output state is: **`new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` is its original value, `candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`, `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
