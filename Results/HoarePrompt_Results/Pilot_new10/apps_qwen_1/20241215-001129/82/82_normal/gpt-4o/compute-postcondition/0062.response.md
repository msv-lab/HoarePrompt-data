Postcondition: ***`new_a` is \(((a + k - 1) // k * k + c - 1) // c * c\); `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions, `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated, `diff` is now positive and divisible by `k + 1`, `k` is now the next value after being incremented by 1, `diff // k` is now a positive integer, and the current `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`.***
