Postcondition: ***`new_a` is \(((a + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + c - 1) // c * c\); `new_b` is \((b + (k + 1) - 1) // (k + 1) * (k + 1) + (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated accordingly if `current_lcm` is smaller than `min_lcm` or equal to `min_lcm` but with a smaller `candidate` value than `min_k`, `diff` remains positive and divisible by `k + 2`, `k` is now `k + 1`, and `diff // (k + 1)` remains a positive integer.*** 

Explanation: 
- If the condition `current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and candidate < min_k)` is true, then `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated to `current_lcm` and `candidate`, respectively.
- If the condition is false, then `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.
