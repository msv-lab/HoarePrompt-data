Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
  - `a` is its original value
  - `candidate` is its original value
  - `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
  - `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`
  - If `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `candidate < min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.

### For Loop Statement
```
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Range of the For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the values `[k, diff // k]`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `candidate` was either `k` or `diff // k`.

2. **Update Candidate for Next Iteration**:
   - If the current `candidate` is `k`, the next candidate will be `diff // k`.
   - If the current `candidate` is `diff // k`, the next candidate will be `k`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - The `new_a` and `new_b` values depend on the current `candidate`, but since these values do not change during the loop (they only get computed once at the start of each iteration), they remain the same.
   - The `current_lcm` and `min_lcm`/`min_k` values are updated based on the loop condition. However, since we are starting a new iteration, `current_lcm` will be re-computed as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

### Conclusion
At the start of the next iteration, the `candidate` will switch to the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`.

#### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- If the previous `candidate` was `k`, the new `candidate` will be `diff // k`.
- If the previous `candidate` was `diff // k`, the new `candidate` will be `k`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State:**
- `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`
- `a` is its original value
- `candidate` is now the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`
- `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\)
- `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`

### Final Answer:
State: **`new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `a` is its original value, `candidate` is now the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`, `new_b` is equal to \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\), `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
