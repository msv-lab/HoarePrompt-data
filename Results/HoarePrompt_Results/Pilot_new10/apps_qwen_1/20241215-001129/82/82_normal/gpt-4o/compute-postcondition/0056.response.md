Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are updated to \((a + k - 1) // k * k\) and \((b + k - 1) // k * k\) respectively, `diff` is positive and divisible by `k`, `k` is the last value it was updated to, `min_lcm` is the minimum value of `current_lcm` found during the loop executions, and `min_k` is the corresponding `candidate` value when `min_lcm` is updated.**
