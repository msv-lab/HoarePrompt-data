Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine after how many full years Limak will become strictly larger than Bob. The program iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. Since the problem constraints ensure that Limak's initial weight is less than or equal to Bob's, and both weights are positive integers, the loop will eventually find a point where Limak's weight is greater than Bob's. The program correctly counts the number of years required for this condition to be met and prints the result. All examples and the general logic of the problem are handled correctly by the program.
