Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob based on their initial weights. The program uses a while loop to triple Limak's weight and double Bob's weight each year until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The number of years required is counted and printed. Given the constraints (weights between 1 and 10), the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
