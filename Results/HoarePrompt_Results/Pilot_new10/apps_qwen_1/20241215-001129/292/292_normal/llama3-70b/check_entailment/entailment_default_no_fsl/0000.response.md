Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a loop to repeatedly triple Limak's weight and double Bob's weight until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The number of years required is counted and printed. This approach works for all given constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), as verified by the provided examples and the nature of the problem. The loop will always terminate because the weights are increasing exponentially, and eventually, Limak's weight will exceed Bob's weight.
