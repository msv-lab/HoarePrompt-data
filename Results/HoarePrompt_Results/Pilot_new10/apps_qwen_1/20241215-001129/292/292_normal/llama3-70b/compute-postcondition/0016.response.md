The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on the conditions provided. Given the constraints that there are no parameters, we need to infer the possible return values based on the given output cases.

Since there are no parameters, the function must generate or calculate a result internally. However, based on the provided output cases, we can understand the nature of the return values.

Case_1: The function returns a value indicating that \(a\) and \(b\) are within the range 1 to 10, with \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\).
Case_2: The function returns a specific value or values based on the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\).

Given the constraints and the output cases, the function likely returns either a confirmation message or a calculated value based on the range and relationship of \(a\) and \(b\).

Functionality: **The function returns a value indicating that \(a\) and \(b\) are within the specified range and possibly a calculated value based on their relationship.**
