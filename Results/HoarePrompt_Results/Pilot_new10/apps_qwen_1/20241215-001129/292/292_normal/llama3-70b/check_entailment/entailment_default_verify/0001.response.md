Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a while loop to triple Limak's weight and double Bob's weight each year until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The number of years required is counted and printed. The output hints accurately summarize the functionality of the program, and there are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements based on the problem description and constraints.
