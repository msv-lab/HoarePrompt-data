To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `a` is 9.
   - `b` is 12, 16, or 20.
   - `years` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `a <= b`.

3. **Objective:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop condition `a <= b` holds true for the next iteration.

4. **Current Values After Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` remains 9 (since it is not modified in the loop body).
   - `b` could be 12, 16, or 20.
   - `years` is increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified. Let's denote the current value of `years` as `years_current`.

5. **Analyzing the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still be less than or equal to `b`.
   - Since `a` is 9 and `b` is either 12, 16, or 20, the loop will continue as long as `b` is greater than or equal to 9.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `a` because `a` is already 9 and will remain 9 in the next iteration.

6. **Considering the Value of `b`:**
   - If `b` is 12, the loop will continue.
   - If `b` is 16, the loop will continue.
   - If `b` is 20, the loop will continue.
   - Since `b` does not change within the loop body and is either 12, 16, or 20, no adjustment is needed for `b`.

7. **Considering the Value of `years`:**
   - `years` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, but its specific value is not critical to the loop condition since the loop only depends on the comparison between `a` and `b`.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `years`.

Based on the above analysis, no adjustments are needed to the given states for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is 9, `b` is 12, 16, or 20, `years` is increased by 1**
