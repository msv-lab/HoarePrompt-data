`a` is multiplied by 3. Given the initial state where `a` is 3, the new value of `a` will be 3 * 3 = 9. The value of `b` remains unchanged because the code only modifies `a`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is 9, `b` is 2 * `b_original` (with `b_original` being an integer between 1 and 5) and `b` must be at least 6.**
