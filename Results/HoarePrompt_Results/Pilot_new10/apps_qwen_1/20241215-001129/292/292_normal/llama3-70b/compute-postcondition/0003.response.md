`a` is multiplied by 3, so the new value of `a` is `3 * a`. The value of `b` remains unchanged, and the value of `years` remains 0. The initial condition that `1 <= a <= b <= 10` still holds.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times its original value (which was between 1 and 10), `b` is an integer entered by the user, and 1 <= a <= b <= 10; `years` is 0**
