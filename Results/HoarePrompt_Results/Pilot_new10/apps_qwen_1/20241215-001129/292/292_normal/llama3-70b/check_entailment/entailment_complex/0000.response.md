Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the current weights of Limak and Bob respectively. The constraint \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\) is respected.

2. **Loop Logic**: The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly triple Limak's weight (`a`) and double Bob's weight (`b`), incrementing a counter `years` each iteration. This logic accurately simulates the growth of Limak and Bob's weights over time according to the problem description.

3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until Limak's weight (`a`) becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight (`b`). Once this condition is met, the loop terminates.

4. **Output**: The program prints the number of years (`years`) required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob. This output directly corresponds to the requirement in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the specified logic and handles all possible cases within the constraints \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). Therefore, the program is correct.
