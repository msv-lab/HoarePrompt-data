`years` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 3, `b` is 2 * `b_original` (with `b_original` being an integer between 1 and 5), `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is 3, `b` is 2 * `b_original` (with `b_original` being an integer between 1 and 5), `years` is 1**
