The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers separated by a space from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since the input values are split and converted to integers, the initial conditions that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\) are maintained. However, the specific values of `a` and `b` are now determined by the user's input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\); the specific values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input.**
