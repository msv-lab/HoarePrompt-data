Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the program is correct, but upon closer inspection, there seems to be a discrepancy between the problem description and the provided code. Specifically, the problem description requires the program to determine the number of full years after which Limak's weight will be strictly greater than Bob's weight. However, the provided code does not include any mechanism to ensure that the loop runs for a sufficient number of years to guarantee that Limak's weight will strictly exceed Bob's weight. While the code appears to work for the given constraints, it lacks the logic to handle edge cases or large inputs that might exceed the constraints but still require the correct number of years to be calculated. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
