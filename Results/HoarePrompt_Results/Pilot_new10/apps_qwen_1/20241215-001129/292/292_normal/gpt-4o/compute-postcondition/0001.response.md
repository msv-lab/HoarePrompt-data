The code initializes a variable `years` to 0. The values of `a` and `b` are not modified by this code, but their initial state is defined as being positive integers within the range \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\). Therefore, after executing the code, the value of `years` is 0, and the values of `a` and `b` remain as they were before the code was executed.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10\), `years` is 0**
