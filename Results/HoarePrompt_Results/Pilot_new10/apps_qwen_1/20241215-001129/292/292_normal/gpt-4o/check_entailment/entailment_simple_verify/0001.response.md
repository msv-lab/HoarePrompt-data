Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the logic of the program. The program correctly triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight each year until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. The annotations accurately describe the state of the variables after each iteration of the loop. Given the problem description and the provided annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the number of years required for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.
