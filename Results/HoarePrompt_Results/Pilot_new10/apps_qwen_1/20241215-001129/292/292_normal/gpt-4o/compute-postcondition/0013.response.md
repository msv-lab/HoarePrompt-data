`years` is incremented by 1, but the initial values of `a` and `b` remain the same, and the inequality \(9a \leq 4b\) still holds true. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is \(27a\); `b` is \(8b\); and \(9a \leq 4b\); `years` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`a` is \(27a\); `b` is \(8b\); and \(9a \leq 4b\); `years` is increased by 1.**
