The code `a *= 3` multiplies the current value of `a` by 3. Given the initial state where `a` is \(9a\) and \(9a \leq 4b\), we update `a` to \(9a \times 3 = 27a\). The condition \(9a \leq 4b\) remains valid because `b` has not changed.

Output State: **`a` is \(27a\); `b` is \(4b\); and \(9a \leq 4b\)**
