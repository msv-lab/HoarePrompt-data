`cnt3` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where the input is an integer between 0 and \(10^9\). The other variables (`cnt1`, `cnt2`, and `cnt4`) are not affected.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an integer input from the first line, 0 <= `cnt1` <= 10^9, `cnt2` is an integer input from the second line, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is 0**
