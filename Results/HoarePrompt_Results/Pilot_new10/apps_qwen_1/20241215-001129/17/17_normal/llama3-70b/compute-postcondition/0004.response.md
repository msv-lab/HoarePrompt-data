The code `print(1)` simply prints the number 1 to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt3` is an input integer, `cnt4` is an input integer, and `cnt3` is less than or equal to `cnt1`**
