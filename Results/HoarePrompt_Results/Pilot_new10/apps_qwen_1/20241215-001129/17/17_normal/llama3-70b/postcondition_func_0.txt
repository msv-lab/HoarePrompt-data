The function reads four integers from the user, each representing the counts of "(((", "()", "())", and "))" respectively. It then compares the count of "())" with the count of "((( )". If the count of "())" is greater than the count of "((( ", it prints `0`; otherwise, it prints `1`. The function does not return any value.
