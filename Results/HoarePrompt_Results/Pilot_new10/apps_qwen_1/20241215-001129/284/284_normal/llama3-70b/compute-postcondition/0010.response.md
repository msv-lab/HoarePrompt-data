According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 3.
- If `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False, otherwise no change in the values of `num` and `i`.

Since `i` starts from 2 and increases by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue if `i` is still within the range defined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given that `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased to 4. Therefore, `i` should be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

We need to check if `i` is still within the range of `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`:
- Calculate `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`: This value depends on `num`, but since `num` is between 1 and 1000, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` will be between 2 and 32 (since \( \sqrt{1000} \approx 31.62 \)).

For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 4) must still be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. This means that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 1000\) and `num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4**.
