Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the original assessment. The program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The function `func_1` accurately determines whether a given number is prime. The main loop iterates through possible values of `m` and prints the first value that makes `n * m + 1` non-prime. Given the problem constraints and the guaranteed existence of a valid `m`, the program will always find and print a suitable `m`. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
