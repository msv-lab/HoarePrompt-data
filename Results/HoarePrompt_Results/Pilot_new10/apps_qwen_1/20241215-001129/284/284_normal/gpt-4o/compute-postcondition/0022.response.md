The code `i += 6` increases the value of `i` by 6. Since the initial state specifies that `x` meets certain conditions and does not return anything from the condition check, the value of `x` remains unchanged. The only variable affected by the code is `i`, which is increased by 6.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(25 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3, and \(x \mod 5 \neq 0\), and \(x \mod 7 \neq 0\), and \(x \geq 121\); `i` is increased by 6**
