The value of `i` is incremented by 6. The initial value of `i` is 5, so after executing `i += 6`, the new value of `i` is `5 + 6 = 11`. The conditions on `x` remain unchanged since the code does not affect `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(25 \leq x \leq 1000\), and \(x > 3\), and \(x\) is not divisible by 2 and \(x\) is not divisible by 3; `i` is 11, and \(x \mod 5 \neq 0\) and \(x \mod 7 \neq 0\)**
