Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the logic of the program. The program correctly iterates over possible values of `m` and uses the `func_1` function to check if `n * m + 1` is a prime number. If `func_1` returns `False`, indicating that `n * m + 1` is not a prime number, the program prints `m` and breaks the loop. Given the problem description and the constraints, the program will always find and print a valid `m` for any input `n` within the specified range. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
