Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. Given an input \( n \), the program searches for an \( m \) such that \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if a number is prime. The prime-checking function correctly handles the cases where \( x \) is 1, 2, 3, or divisible by 2 or 3, and it uses an efficient algorithm to check for primality for larger numbers.

The main loop iterates over possible values of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 and checks if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number using `func_1`. As soon as a valid \( m \) is found, it prints the value and exits the loop. Given the constraints and the guarantee that an answer exists, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \).

Since the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all relevant cases as described in the problem statement, the correctness is **True**.
