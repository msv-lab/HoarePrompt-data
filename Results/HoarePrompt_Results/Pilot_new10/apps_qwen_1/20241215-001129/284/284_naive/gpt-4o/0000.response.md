Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements a solution to find a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The program checks for each value of \( m \) from 1 to 1000 if \( n \cdot m + 1 \) is not a prime number using the `func_1` function, which accurately determines whether a number is prime or not. Given the guarantees that such an \( m \) exists within the specified range, the program will always find and print a valid \( m \). Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
