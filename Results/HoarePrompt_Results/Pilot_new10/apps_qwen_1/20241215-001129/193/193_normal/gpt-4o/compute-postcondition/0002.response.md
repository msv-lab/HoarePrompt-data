The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly from the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints provided, the function should work with two integers `x` and `y` where `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`. 

Given the output cases are not specified directly within the function definition but rather seem to imply the function's behavior, we can infer the following:

- The function likely calculates something related to the range defined by `x` and `y`.
- Since no specific output is mentioned in the function definition itself, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with two integers `x` and `y` where `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.

Functionality: **The function works with two integers `x` and `y` where `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.**
