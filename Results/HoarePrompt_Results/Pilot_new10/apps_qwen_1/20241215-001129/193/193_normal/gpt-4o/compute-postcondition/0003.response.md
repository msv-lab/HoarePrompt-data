The annotated code indicates that the function takes two integers `x` and `y` as input, where `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`. However, the actual function does not accept any parameters but reads them from standard input. The function then prints the result of the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.

Let's analyze the expression:
- `(x - y) // 2` performs integer division.
- `(x - y) % 2` gives the remainder when `(x - y)` is divided by 2.

The combination of these operations effectively computes the floor of the average of `x` and `y`. Given the constraints, this operation will always yield an integer.

To summarize, the function reads two integers `x` and `y` from standard input where `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`, and prints the floor of the average of `x` and `y`.
