The code `print(abs(x - y))` calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints it. Since both `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` will be a positive integer less than `x - 3`. However, the specific value of `abs(x - y)` cannot be determined without knowing the exact values of `x` and `y`.

After the code executes, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` is printed.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000; `y` is an integer such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000; the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` is printed.**
