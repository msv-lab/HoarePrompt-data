Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem description, the goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y` by modifying the length of one side per second while maintaining the triangle property at all times. 

However, the given program simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which is `abs(x - y)`. This approach does not take into account the constraints that the sides of the triangle must remain valid during the transformation process. For example, the program would output the same result for both `func(6, 3)` and `func(6, 2)`, which is `3` and `4` respectively, but the actual minimum number of seconds required to achieve the desired transformation differs significantly.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to consider the constraints and find the minimum number of steps required to change `x` to `y` while ensuring the triangle inequality is maintained at each step.
