The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It has a constraint that variables `x` and `y` should be integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`. However, since these variables are not passed as arguments to the function, we need to infer their usage from the context provided.

Given the constraints and the lack of specific operations performed within the function body, we can conclude that the function is expected to perform some operation based on these constraints but the problem statement does not provide explicit details about the operation.

Since no specific return values or cases are mentioned, we can only state the constraints on the variables.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates under the constraint that variables `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`.**
