Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the number of stones in each pile can change through both adding and removing stones. Specifically, the program only checks if the total number of stones is the same and if the sorted lists of stones are equal. However, it does not consider scenarios where the redistribution of stones could still result in the final counts.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9
```
The program will incorrectly output "Yes" because the total number of stones is the same (14), and the sorted lists are also the same. However, the redistribution of stones from the first and third piles to form the second pile is not accounted for. The correct output should be "No" because no sequence of valid jury actions can transform the initial state `[2, 3, 9]` into the final state `[1, 7, 9]`.

A correct solution would need to check if the difference between corresponding elements is at most 1 for all pairs `(x_i, y_i)` and ensure that the absolute difference in the total number of stones is within the limits allowed by the jury's actions.
