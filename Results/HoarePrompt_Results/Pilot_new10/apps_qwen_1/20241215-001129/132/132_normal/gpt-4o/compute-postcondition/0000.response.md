The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`, the value of `n` remains within this range after the input. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `x` and `y` are lists of `n` integers each, where 0 ≤ `x[i]` ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ `y[i]` ≤ 1000 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`.**
