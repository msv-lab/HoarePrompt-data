Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code shows that the program only checks if the total number of stones in the second configuration (`total_y`) is less than or equal to the total number of stones in the first configuration (`total_x`). This check is insufficient because the jury members can move stones between piles, not just reduce the total number of stones. The program fails to account for the possibility of moving stones between different piles, which is a critical part of the problem. Therefore, the program may incorrectly print "Yes" even when the transformation is not possible.
