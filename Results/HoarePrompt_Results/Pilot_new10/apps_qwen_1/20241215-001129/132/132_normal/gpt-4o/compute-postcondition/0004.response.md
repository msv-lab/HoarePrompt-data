`total_y` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `y`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `total_x` also remains unchanged because they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `y` is a list of `n` integers (new values); `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`; `total_y` is the sum of all elements in the list `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `y` is a list of `n` integers (new values); `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`; `total_y` is the sum of all elements in the list `y`.**
