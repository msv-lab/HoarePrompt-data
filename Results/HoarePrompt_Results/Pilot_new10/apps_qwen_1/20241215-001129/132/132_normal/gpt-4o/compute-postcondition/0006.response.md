The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console and does not affect any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `y` is a list of `n` integers (new values); `total_x` is the sum of all elements in the list `x`; `total_y` is the sum of all elements in the list `y`; the current value of `total_y` is greater than `total_x`; the console prints 'No'**
