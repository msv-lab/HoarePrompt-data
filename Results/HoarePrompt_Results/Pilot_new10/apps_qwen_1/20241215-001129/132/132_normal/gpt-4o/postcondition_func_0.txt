The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` integers. It calculates the sum of elements in `x` and `y` and prints "No" if the sum of `y` is greater than the sum of `x`, otherwise it prints "Yes". Note that the function assumes `n` is within the valid range, but does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is outside this range.
