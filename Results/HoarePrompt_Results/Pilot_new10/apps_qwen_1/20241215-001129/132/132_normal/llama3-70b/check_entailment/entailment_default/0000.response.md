Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code only checks if the sum of the two lists is equal and if the sorted versions of the two lists are identical. However, this approach is insufficient to determine if the transformations described in the problem are possible.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  2 3 9
  1 7 9
  ```

The sum of both lists is 14, and sorting both lists results in `[2, 3, 9]` and `[1, 7, 9]`, which are not identical. Therefore, the current implementation would incorrectly output "No".

However, the transformations allowed by the problem statement (jury members taking one stone or moving one stone from one pile to another) could potentially result in the second configuration from the first. For instance:
- Jury member takes one stone from pile 1 to pile 2: `[1, 4, 9]`
- Jury member takes one stone from pile 2 to pile 3: `[1, 3, 10]`
- Jury member takes one stone from pile 1 to pile 3: `[0, 3, 11]`
- Jury member adds one stone to pile 2: `[0, 4, 11]`
- Jury member adds one stone to pile 3: `[0, 4, 12]`
