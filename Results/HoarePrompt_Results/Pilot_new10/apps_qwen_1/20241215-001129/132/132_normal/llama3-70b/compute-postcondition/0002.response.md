The code `y = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts each integer to type `int`, then stores these integers in the list `y`. The length of `y` is equal to the length of `x`, which is `n`.

Since the initial state of `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `x` is a list of integers with the length equal to `n`, and `y` is initially a list of integers with the same length as `x` and `n`, after executing the code, the length of `y` will be `n`.

The content of `y` will be updated to the integers entered by the user, converted to integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user.**
