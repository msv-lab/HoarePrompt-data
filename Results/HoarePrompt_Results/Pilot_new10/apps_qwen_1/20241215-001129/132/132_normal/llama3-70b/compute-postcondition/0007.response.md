The code `y.sort()` sorts the list `y` in ascending order. Since `y` was initially a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user, and the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`, the sorting operation does not change the sum of elements in `y`. However, the elements within `y` are now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, sorted in ascending order; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user and sorted in ascending order; the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`**
