The code `print('Yes')` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints the string 'Yes' to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, sorted in ascending order; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, containing integers entered by the user and sorted in ascending order; the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`; `x` is equal to `y`; a string 'Yes' has been printed to the console.**
