The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. The variable `y` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` remains the same as it was initially.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive)
- `x` and `y` are lists of integers such that `len(x) == len(y) == n` and `0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 1000` and `0 ≤ y[i] ≤ 1000` for all `i` in range(`n`).

After executing the code:
- `n` retains its original value (an integer between 1 and 50)
- `x` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the user's input, with the length equal to `n`
- `y` remains unchanged

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, with the length equal to `n`; `y` is a list of integers with the same length as `x` and `n`**
