The function reads three inputs: an integer `n` and two lists of integers `x` and `y`. It checks if the sum of elements in `x` is equal to the sum of elements in `y`. If not, it prints 'No'. If the sums are equal, it sorts both lists and checks if they are identical. If they are, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
