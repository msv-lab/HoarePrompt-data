The code assigns the value of `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` to the variable `ans`. This means that `ans` will be the minimum between `k` and the product `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `ans` is min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))**
