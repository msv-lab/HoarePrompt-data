Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the minimum number of possible positions for the scoop-net instead of maximizing the expected number of caught fishes. The output hints confirm that the function calculates the ratio of the minimum number of positions to the total number of positions, which does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the expected number of caught fishes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
