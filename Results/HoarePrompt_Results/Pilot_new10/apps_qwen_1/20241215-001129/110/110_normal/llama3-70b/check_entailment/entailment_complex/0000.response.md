Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. According to the problem statement, the goal is to place \(k\) fishes in the pond in such a way that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized when using the scoop-net. The program, however, simply calculates and prints the minimum of \(k\) and \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\) divided by \((n - r + 1) \times (m - r + 1)\), which is always 1. This result does not reflect the strategy needed to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

To maximize the expected number of caught fishes, the optimal strategy involves placing the fishes in a way that maximizes their exposure to the scoop-net's possible positions. One effective approach is to place the fishes in the central region of the pond, ensuring that they are in cells that are more likely to be covered by the scoop-net regardless of its position.

The program fails to implement any such strategy, thus it does not correctly solve the problem as described.
