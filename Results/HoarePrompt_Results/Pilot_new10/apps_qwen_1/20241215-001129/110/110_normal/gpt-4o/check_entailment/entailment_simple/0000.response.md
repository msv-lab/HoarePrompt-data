Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Coverage:**
   - The `coverage` function calculates the number of positions the scoop-net would cover if its bottom-left corner is at cell `(x, y)`. However, the formula used in the `coverage` function is incorrect. It should consider the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond.
   - The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{coverage} = \left(\min(x + r - 1, n) - \max(x, 1)\right) \times \left(\min(y + r - 1, m) - \max(y, 1)\right)
     \]
   - The current implementation incorrectly uses `min(x + 1, n - r + 1)` and `max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)`, which does not accurately represent the valid range of positions for the scoop-net.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Maximizing Expected Value:**
   - The main function `func_1` aims to maximize the expected number of caught fishes by selecting positions for the fishes based on the coverage values. However, the logic for selecting positions is flawed.
   - Instead of using a heap to prioritize positions based on coverage, the code simply pops from the heap `k` times without ensuring that the selected positions are optimal. The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated strategy to place the fishes in such a way that maximizes the expected number of caught fishes.

3. **Incorrect Output Format:**
   - The problem specifies that the output should be a floating-point number with up to 10 decimal places of precision. The program should ensure that the output is formatted correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:

1. Calculate the coverage for each possible position `(x, y)` in the pond.
2. Use a priority queue (or a max-heap) to select the top `k` positions with the highest coverage.
3. Compute the expected number of caught fishes by averaging the coverage values of these `k` positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())

# Function to calculate the coverage
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + r - 1, n) - max(x, 1)) * (min(y + r - 1, m) - max(y, 1))

# Function to find the maximum expected number of caught fishes
def func_1(n, m, r, k):
    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cov, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return -total_coverage / total_positions

print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')
```

This corrected version ensures that the coverage is calculated correctly and uses a priority queue to select the best `k` positions, thereby maximizing the expected number of caught fishes.
