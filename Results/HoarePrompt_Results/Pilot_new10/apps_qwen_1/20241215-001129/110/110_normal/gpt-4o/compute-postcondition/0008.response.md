Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `r` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), `k` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n*m, 10^5), `heap` is a list containing min(m) elements `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State Conditions**: 
   - `n > 0`
   - `m ≥ 1`
   - `1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m)`
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ min(n*m, 10^5)`
   - `heap` is initially an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for each value of `y` in the range `0` to `m-1`.
   - For each `y`, the tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` is pushed into the heap using `heapq.heappush`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - Since the loop runs `m` times (from `y = 0` to `y = m-1`), the heap will contain exactly `m` elements.
   - Each element in the heap will be of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `y` ranges from `0` to `m-1`.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `m` is 0, the loop will not execute at all, and the heap will remain an empty list.

Thus, the final state of the loop after all iterations is that `heap` contains `m` elements, each being `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `y` ranges from `0` to `m-1`.
