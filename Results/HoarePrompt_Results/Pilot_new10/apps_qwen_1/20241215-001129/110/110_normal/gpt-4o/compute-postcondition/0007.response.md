The initial state includes `y` being 1 and the heap containing the tuple `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)`. The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` will push a new tuple into the heap. Since `y` is 1, the new tuple to be pushed is `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`.

Given the initial state, the heap now contains two tuples:
1. `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)`
2. `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`

Output State: **`y` is 1, the heap contains the tuples `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)` and `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)`**
