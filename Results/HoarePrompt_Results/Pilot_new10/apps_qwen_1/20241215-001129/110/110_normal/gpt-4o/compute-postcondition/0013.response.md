The code pushes a new element into the heap. The new element is `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`, where `x` is `x_end + 1` (the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration) and `y` is 1. The heap was previously a list containing `min(m)` elements `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`.

After the push operation, the heap will have one more element. The heap's structure may change due to the push operation, but the exact structure is not specified. The only specific changes are the addition of the new element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `k` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n*m, 10^5)\), `heap` is a list containing `min(m) + 1` elements `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, `x` is `x_end + 1` where `x_end` is the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration, and `y` is 1.**
