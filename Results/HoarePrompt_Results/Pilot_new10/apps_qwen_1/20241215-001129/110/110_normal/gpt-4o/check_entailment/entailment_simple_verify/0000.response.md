Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because although the annotated version of the code appears to be correct and the coverage calculation is indeed correct, the greedy approach used in the `func_1` function does not guarantee the optimal solution. The problem requires finding the configuration of k fishes that maximizes the expected number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is placed randomly. A greedy approach may not always achieve this optimal solution, as it only considers the highest coverage cells without exploring all possible configurations. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all valid inputs, which makes it incorrect according to the problem description.
