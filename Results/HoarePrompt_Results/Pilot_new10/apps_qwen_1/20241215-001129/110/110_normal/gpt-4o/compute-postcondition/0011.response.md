In the given initial state, `y` is 0. The code snippet is:
```python
heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
```
This line pushes a tuple into the heap, where the first element of the tuple is `-coverage(x, y)`, and the second and third elements are `x` and `y` respectively. 

Given that `y` is 0, the tuple pushed into the heap is `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)`.

Let's summarize the changes and the output state:
- The `heap` now contains the new tuple `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)` in addition to its previous contents.
- `x` remains unchanged because the line of code does not modify `x`.
- `y` is incremented by 1 during the next iteration of the loop, but since the loop hasn't started yet, `y` remains 0 for this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `k` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n*m, 10^5)\), `heap` is a list containing `min(m)` elements `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` where `y` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, `x` is `x_end + 1` where `x_end` is the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 0, and the heap now includes the tuple `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)`.**
