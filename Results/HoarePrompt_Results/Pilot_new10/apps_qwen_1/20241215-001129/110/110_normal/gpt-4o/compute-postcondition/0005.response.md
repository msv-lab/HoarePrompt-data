The code uses `heapq.heappush` to add a tuple to a heap. The tuple contains three elements: the negation of `coverage(x, y)`, `x`, and `y`. Since `y` is given as 0 in the initial state, the tuple becomes `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)`.

The variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, so its value remains unchanged. The variable `y` is explicitly set to 0, so it does not change. The heap is modified, but the specific structure of the heap is not provided, so we only know that the tuple `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)` has been added to the heap.

Output State: **`y` is 0, the heap contains the tuple `(-coverage(x, 0), x, 0)`**
