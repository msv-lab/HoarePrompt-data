The code pushes a new element into the heap. Specifically, the new element is `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)`. The original heap contained `2m + 1` elements, and now it has `2m + 2` elements. The heap property is maintained after this operation.

Output State: **`y` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 2, `r` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq r \leq \min(n, m)\), `k` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq k \leq \min(n*m, 10^5)\), `heap` is a list containing \(2m + 2\) elements with the new element `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` included, and the heap property is maintained.**
