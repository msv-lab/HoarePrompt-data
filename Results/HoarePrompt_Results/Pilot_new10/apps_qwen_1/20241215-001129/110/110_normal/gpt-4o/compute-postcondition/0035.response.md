`total_coverage` is decremented by the value of `cov`. The initial state specifies that `k` is `k - 1`, `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - 2 * cov`, and `cov` is the first element of the next tuple popped from `heap`. After popping the tuple, `cov` is updated, but the initial value of `total_coverage` is already adjusted by `2 * cov`. Therefore, the code `total_coverage -= cov` simply subtracts the current value of `cov` from `total_coverage`.

Output State: **`k` is `k - 1`, `total_coverage` is `total_coverage - 3 * cov`, `cov` is the first element of the next tuple popped from `heap`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple popped from `heap`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple popped from `heap`, `total_coverage`, `n`, `m`, `r`, and `heap` remain unchanged.**
