Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by using a priority queue to store the coverage values of each cell and then selecting the top `k` cells with the highest coverage. However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution. The coverage function calculates the number of cells that can be affected by placing a fish in a specific cell, but the implementation of this function is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3 2 3
```
The expected output should be 2.0000000000, which is the same as the provided output in the example. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the coverage for each cell and select the top `k` cells based on this incorrect coverage calculation.

Let's analyze the coverage function:
```python
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))
```

This function is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the number of cells that can be affected by placing a fish in cell `(x, y)`. Specifically, the subtraction and comparison operations in the `min` and `max` functions are incorrect. 

A correct implementation of the coverage function should be:
```python
def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1, 0))
```

With this corrected coverage function, the program would correctly identify the best cells to place the fishes to maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

Since the provided program uses an incorrect coverage function, it cannot produce the correct result for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
