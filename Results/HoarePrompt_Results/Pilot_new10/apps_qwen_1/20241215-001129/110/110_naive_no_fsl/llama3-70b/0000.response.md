Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the maximum number of fishes that can be caught in a single scoop-net position rather than the expected number of caught fishes when the scoop-net is thrown randomly.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to distribute the fishes in such a way that the expected number of caught fishes is maximized. The current implementation simply calculates the minimum number of positions where the scoop-net can be placed, which does not maximize the expected number of caught fishes.

For example, consider the input `3 3 2 3`. The correct output should be `2.0000000000` if the fishes are optimally placed, but the program outputs `1.5000000000`, which is incorrect.

A correct solution would involve placing the fishes in such a way that the expected value is maximized. One optimal strategy is to place the fishes in the central area of the pond, ensuring that a significant portion of the possible scoop-net positions will catch multiple fishes.
