Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `A` and `B` are lists of lists of integers.
  - If the element at position `[i][j]` in `A` is not equal to the corresponding element in `B`, the function returns -1.
  - Otherwise, the elements remain unchanged.
- The loop iterates over `j` using `range(m)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial States**: We know that up to a certain `j` value (let's call it `j_end`), all elements in `A` and `B` at positions `[i][j]` were equal.
2. **Current State**: The loop has just completed an iteration for `j = j_end`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to check if there are still elements left to compare, i.e., if `j_end + 1 < m`.

### Steps:
1. **Check Condition**: For the loop to continue, `j_end + 1` should be within the bounds of `range(m)`.
2. **Update State**: If `j_end + 1 < m`, then the next value of `j` will be `j_end + 1`.

### Updated State:
- Since the loop continues if `j_end + 1 < m`, we need to update the state such that `j` is set to `j_end + 1`.

### Final State:
- `A` and `B` remain the same.
- `j` is now `j_end + 1`.

Given this reasoning, let's formulate the final state:

### Example Answer:
Since `j` was `j_end` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`A` and `B` are lists of lists of integers, `j` is `j_end + 1`**.

However, to be more specific and consistent with the provided format, let's assume `j_end` was some integer value derived from the previous state.

### Specific Example Answer:
If `j_end` was 5 (meaning `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration), then:

State: **`A` and `B` are lists of lists of integers, `j` is 6**.

So, the general form would be:

State: **`A` and `B` are lists of lists of integers, `j` is `j_end + 1`**.
