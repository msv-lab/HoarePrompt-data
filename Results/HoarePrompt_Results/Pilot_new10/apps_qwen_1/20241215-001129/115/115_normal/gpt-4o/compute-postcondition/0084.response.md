Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers where each element `A[i][j]` is equal to the corresponding element `B[i][j]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` and all `j` from `0` to `m-1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `m`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1 based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop, and no further updates can be made since the loop has finished executing.**
