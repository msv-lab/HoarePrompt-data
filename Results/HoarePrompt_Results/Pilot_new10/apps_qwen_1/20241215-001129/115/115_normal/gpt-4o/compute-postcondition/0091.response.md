The code prints the first element of the first tuple and the second element of the first tuple in the `operations` list. These values are taken from the `operations` list and printed, but they do not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples that contains at least two tuples, the first element of the first tuple in `operations` has been printed, the second element of the first tuple in `operations` has been printed, the first element of the second tuple in `operations` will be printed, the second element of the second tuple in `operations` will be printed, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value**
