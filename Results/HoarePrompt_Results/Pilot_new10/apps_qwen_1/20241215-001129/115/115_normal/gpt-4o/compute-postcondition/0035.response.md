The code assigns the value 1 to the elements `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]`. Since these elements were previously unspecified in the initial state, they are now explicitly set to 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be the same, `m` must be greater than 0, `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**
