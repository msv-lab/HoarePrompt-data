The code prints the first two elements of the first tuple in the `operations` list. However, the values of the printed elements depend on the contents of the `operations` list, which is not specified in the initial state. Since no new assignments are made to `A`, `B`, `n`, or `m`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of tuples that contains at least one more tuple, the first element of the first tuple in `operations` is printed, the second element of the first tuple in `operations` is printed, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value.**
