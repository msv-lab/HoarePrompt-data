The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The values of `i` and `j` are not changed, but the list `operations` now includes the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. The conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` must be 0, `m` must be at least 3, the element `B[i][j]` is 1, the element `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, the element `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, the element `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
