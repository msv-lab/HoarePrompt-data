Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, the code only checks for a single 2x2 block of 1s in `A` and sets the corresponding elements in `B` to 1. However, the problem description requires transforming `B` into `A` using any sequence of operations, not just checking for one specific 2x2 block.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 2
1 1
1 0
```

The correct solution would require setting the entire 2x2 matrix to 1, but the current code would return -1 because it only checks for a single 2x2 block of 1s and finds none.

To fix this, the code needs to check all possible 2x2 submatrices in `A` and update `B` accordingly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    operations = []

    # Iterate through all possible 2x2 submatrices in A
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))

    # Check if B matches A
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                print(-1)
                return
    
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
```

This corrected code ensures that all 2x2 submatrices in `A` are checked and the corresponding elements in `B` are updated accordingly.
