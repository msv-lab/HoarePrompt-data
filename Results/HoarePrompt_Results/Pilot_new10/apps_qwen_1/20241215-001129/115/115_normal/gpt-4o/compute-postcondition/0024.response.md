The code updates the values of four elements in a 2D list `B`. Specifically, it sets `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` to 1. The initial values of the variables are as follows:
- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `j` is `m - 2`

After executing the code, the following changes occur:
- `i` remains `i_end + 1`
- `j` remains `m - 2`
- `n` remains greater than `i_end + 1`
- `m` remains greater than 1
- Four elements in the 2D list `B` are updated to 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `i_end + 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, and `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`**
