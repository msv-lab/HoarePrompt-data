According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m - 2` (since `range(m - 1)` generates values from `0` to `m - 2`). The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `j` must be 1.
- `m` must be at least 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.

Since `m` must be at least 3, it does not change based on the value of `j`. `n` remains unchanged as well.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must be 2.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` must be 2, `m` must be at least 3**
