The code assigns the value 1 to multiple elements in a matrix `B`. However, since `B` is not defined in the initial state and no information about its structure (like being a 2D list) is provided, we cannot determine the exact impact on `B`. But based on the given conditions, we can infer the following:

- `n` must be at least 2
- `j` must be 1
- `m` must be at least 3

The code does not affect `n`, `j`, or `m` directly. It only updates the matrix `B` at specific indices. Since `B` is not explicitly defined, we cannot provide specific values for the updated elements. 

Therefore, the Output State remains:
- `n` must be at least 2
- `j` must be 1
- `m` must be at least 3
- `B` is updated such that `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, where `i` and `j` are not specified.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` must be 1, `m` must be at least 3, `B` is updated such that `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`**
