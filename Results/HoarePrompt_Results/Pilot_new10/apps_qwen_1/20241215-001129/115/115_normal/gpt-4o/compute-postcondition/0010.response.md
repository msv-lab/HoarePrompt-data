The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple containing `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Since the initial state does not include the `operations` list, we assume it is initialized as an empty list before this code is executed. The variables `n`, `j`, `m`, and `B` remain unchanged in their values.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` must be 1, `m` must be at least 3, `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `operations` is `[(i + 1, j + 1)]`**
