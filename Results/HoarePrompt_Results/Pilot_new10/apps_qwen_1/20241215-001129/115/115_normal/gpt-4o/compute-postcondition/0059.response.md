Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-1`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1 based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop, and no further updates can be made since the loop has finished executing, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` in the range `[0, m)`.
- For each iteration, if `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the function returns -1 immediately.
- Since the loop completes without returning, it means that for every `j` in the range `[0, m)`, `A[i][j]` must be equal to `B[i][j]`.

Given that the loop iterates over all possible `j` values (from 0 to `m-1`), the last iteration will occur when `j = m-1`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` remains `n-2` and `j` becomes `m-1`.

Since the loop does not change any of the variables other than checking the condition and potentially returning -1, the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, and `operations` remain unchanged. The only additional information we gain is that `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` after all iterations complete.
