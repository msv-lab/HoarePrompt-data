Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The given for loop is `for i in range(n - 1):`. This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-2`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `i` is the index of the last element processed in the loop.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range, which is the number of elements in the sequence minus one.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n-1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will become `k+1` in the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n-1`, so after the increment, the new condition becomes `(k+1) < n-1` or `k < n-2`.

Given that the loop just finished its previous iteration, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`. Since the loop just finished, `k` is one less than `n-1` (because `i` starts from `0`).

So, the new state for the next iteration should reflect:
- `i` is now `k + 1` (which is `n-2`).
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `n` remains the same.

Putting this into the required format:

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be the same**
