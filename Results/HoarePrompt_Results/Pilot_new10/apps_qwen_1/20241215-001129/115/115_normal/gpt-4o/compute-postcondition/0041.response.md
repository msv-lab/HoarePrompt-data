Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-2`, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is the same. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, and operations contain the tuple `(n-1, n-1)`. Otherwise, the state of `B` remains unchanged and `m` is still greater than 0.***
