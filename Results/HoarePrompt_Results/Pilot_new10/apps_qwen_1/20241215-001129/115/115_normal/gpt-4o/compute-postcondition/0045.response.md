Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is the same; `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j+1]` is 1, `B[i+1][j]` is 1, `B[i+1][j+1]` is 1; `operations` contains the tuple `(j, j+1)` if the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j+1] == 1 and (A[i+1][j] == 1) and (A[i+1][j+1] == 1)` is true, otherwise no changes are made to `B` and `operations`.***
