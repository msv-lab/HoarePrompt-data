To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given conditions and information:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`
   - `j` is `m - 2`
   - `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`
   - `m` must be greater than 1
   - If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then:
     - `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`
     - `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`
   - Otherwise, the values of `A` and `B` remain unchanged and `operations` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m - 2` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m - 2`.

### Adjusting the States:

1. **Increment `j`:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `m - 1`.

2. **Check if `j` Exceeds the Range:**
   - The loop will terminate when `j` reaches `m - 1`.
   - If `j` exceeds `m - 1`, the loop will stop executing.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `i` remains `i_end + 1` because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `n` remains greater than `i_end + 1` because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `m` remains greater than 1 because it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m - 1`.

### Conclusion:

Since `j` is currently `m - 2`, it will be incremented to `m - 1` at the start of the next iteration. The loop will then check if `j` is less than `m - 1` to decide whether to continue or terminate.

### Final State:

- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`
- `m` must be greater than 1

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, and `m` must be greater than 1**
