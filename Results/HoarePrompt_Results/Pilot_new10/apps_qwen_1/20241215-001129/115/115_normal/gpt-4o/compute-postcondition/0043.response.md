The code assigns the value 1 to four elements in a matrix `B`. The indices of these elements are derived from the variables `i`, `j`, `i+1`, and `j+1`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is `n-2`
- `j` is `n-1`
- `m` is greater than 0
- `n` is the same

The code updates the following elements in the matrix `B`:

- `B[i][j]` becomes 1
- `B[i][j + 1]` becomes 1
- `B[i + 1][j]` becomes 1
- `B[i + 1][j + 1]` becomes 1

Given the initial values of `i` and `j`, we can determine the updated values for the indices used in the assignments:

- `i` remains `n-2`
- `j` remains `n-1`
- `i + 1` is `(n-2) + 1 = n-1`
- `j + 1` is `(n-1) + 1 = n`

So, the matrix `B` will be updated such that:

- `B[n-2][n-1]` is 1
- `B[n-2][n]` is 1
- `B[n-1][n-1]` is 1
- `B[n-1][n]` is 1

All other variables (`i`, `j`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `j` is `n-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is the same; `B[n-2][n-1]` is 1, `B[n-2][n]` is 1, `B[n-1][n-1]` is 1, `B[n-1][n]` is 1**
