Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code attempts to identify and mark all 2x2 blocks of 1s in matrix `A` in matrix `B`. However, this approach fails to handle cases where individual elements need to be set to 1 without being part of a complete 2x2 block.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

The correct sequence of operations would involve setting the elements `(1,1)`, `(1,3)`, and `(3,1)` to 1. However, the current implementation only marks full 2x2 blocks and would fail to correctly transform `B` into `A`.

Here's a counterexample that the code does not handle correctly:
- Input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```
- Expected output:
```
3
1 1
1 3
3 1
```
- Actual output:
```
-1
```

Thus, the code fails to cover all necessary cases and is therefore incorrect.
