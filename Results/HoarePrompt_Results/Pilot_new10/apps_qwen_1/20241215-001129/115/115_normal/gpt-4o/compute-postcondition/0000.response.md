The code initializes an empty list named `operations`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and `operations` is an empty list.**
