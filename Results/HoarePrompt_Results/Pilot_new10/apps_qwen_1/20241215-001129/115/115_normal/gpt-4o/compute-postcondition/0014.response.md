The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `i` and `j`. Since `j` is initially 2, `j + 1` will be 3. But `i` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the tuple appended to `operations` will be `(i + 1, 3)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `B[0][2]`, `B[0][3]`, `B[1][2]`, and `B[1][3]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` must be 2, `m` must be at least 3; `B[0][2] = 1`, `B[0][3] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`, `B[1][3] = 1`; operations contains `(i + 1, 3)`**
