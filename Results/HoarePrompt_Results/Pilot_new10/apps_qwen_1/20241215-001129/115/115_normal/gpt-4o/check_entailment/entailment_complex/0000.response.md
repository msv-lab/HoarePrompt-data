Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), and constructs matrix \( A \) from the given input.

2. **Matrix Transformation Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes matrix \( B \) as a matrix of zeros.
   - It then iterates over all possible 2x2 submatrices in \( A \) and checks if they contain four 1s. If so, it sets the corresponding elements in \( B \) to 1 and records the coordinates of the top-left element of the 2x2 block in the `operations` list.
   
3. **Verification**:
   - After the transformations, the program checks if \( A \) and \( B \) are identical. If they are not, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations and each operation (coordinates of the 2x2 blocks).
   
4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem statement requirements. If it's possible to transform \( B \) into \( A \), it prints the number of operations followed by the coordinates of the operations. If it's not possible, it prints `-1`.

The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description precisely, ensuring that it will work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
