Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `0`
- `n` is the same as the initial value
- `m` is the same as the initial value
- `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1
- `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1 based on the conditions met during the loop execution
- `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop
- No further updates can be made since the loop has finished executing
- `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` and `A[i][j]` is equal to 1

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `m-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `0`.

### Determining the Next State:
- The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`.
- Since `j` is currently `0` and the loop will increment `j` in the next iteration, the next value of `j` will be `1`.
- The condition `j < m` must hold true for the loop to continue.

### Updated States:
- `i` remains `n-1` because the loop over `j` does not affect `i`.
- `j` is incremented to `1`.
- `n` and `m` remain the same as they are not modified by the loop over `j`.
- `A` and `B` remain unchanged since no further updates can be made.
- `operations` remains the same as it was already populated and no further updates are possible.
- `A[i][j]` is still equal to `B[i][j]` and `A[i][j]` is equal to 1, as this is a condition specified and not affected by the loop over `j`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `1`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `m` is the same as the initial value, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0 or 1 based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `operations` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the 2x2 blocks in `A` that were updated to 1s in `B` according to the conditions specified in the loop, and no further updates can be made since the loop has finished executing, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` and `A[i][j]` is equal to 1**
