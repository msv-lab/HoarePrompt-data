Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, and `m` must be greater than 1. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` and `operations` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, the values of `A` and `B` remain unchanged and `operations` remains unchanged.***
