The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Since `i` and `j` are specific variables in the initial state, the tuple will be updated accordingly. The operations of `i` and `j` do not change their values within this line of code. Therefore, the value of `i` remains `i_end + 1`, and the value of `j` remains as it was initially.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `j` is unchanged, `operations` now contains `[(i_end + 2, j_end + 2)]`**
