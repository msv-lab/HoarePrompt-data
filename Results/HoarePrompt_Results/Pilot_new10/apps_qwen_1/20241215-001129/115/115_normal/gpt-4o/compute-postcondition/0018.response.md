According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will run for `m - 1` iterations. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure `m` is greater than 1 because `range(m - 1)` means the loop will iterate from 0 to `m - 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`

These initial states do not directly affect the condition for the loop to execute. What matters here is the value of `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 1.

So, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `m` is greater than 1.

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, `m` must be greater than 1**
