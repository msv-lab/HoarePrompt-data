The code initializes a 2D list `B` with dimensions `n` by `m`, where each element is set to 0. The elements of `A` and `operations` remain unchanged.

- `B` is initialized with `n` rows and `m` columns, each containing 0s.
- `A` and `operations` retain their initial states.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and `operations` is an empty list; `B` is a 2D list of dimensions `n` by `m` where each element is 0.**
