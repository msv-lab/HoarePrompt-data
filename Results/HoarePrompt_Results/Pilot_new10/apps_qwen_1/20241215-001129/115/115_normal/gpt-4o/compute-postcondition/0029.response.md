The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are `i_end + 1` and `m - 1` respectively. After the operation, these values increase by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `j` is `m`, `n` must be greater than `i_end + 1`, `m` must be greater than 1; `B[i][j]` is not specified in the operations, `B[i][j + 1]` is not specified in the operations, `B[i + 1][j]` is not specified in the operations, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is not specified in the operations; `operations` contains the tuple `(i_end + 2, m)`.**
