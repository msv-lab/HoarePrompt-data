The code `print(op[0], op[1])` simply prints the first and second elements of the first tuple in the `ops` list. This does not change any variables or their values; it only outputs them. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the first and second elements of the first tuple in `ops` are printed.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, and the first tuple in `ops` is printed with its first and second elements.**
