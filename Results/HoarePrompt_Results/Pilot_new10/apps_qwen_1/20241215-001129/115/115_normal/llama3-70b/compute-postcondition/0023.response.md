To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and the for loop:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2
   - `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
   - `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each position `(i, j)` in the matrix that satisfies the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(m - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `m-2` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will execute if `m - 1` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to ensure that `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `i`, `n`, `A`, and `ops` do not directly affect whether the loop runs as long as `m` meets the requirement.

Thus, the state before the first execution of the for loop should be adjusted to ensure `m` is at least 2.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each position `(i, j)` in the matrix that satisfies the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`**
