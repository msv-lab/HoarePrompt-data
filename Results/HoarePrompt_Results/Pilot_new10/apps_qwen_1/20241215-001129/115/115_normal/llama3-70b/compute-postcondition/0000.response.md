The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by space, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `m`. The initial values of `n` and `m` are positive integers between 2 and 50, but after executing this code, their values are taken from the input. The matrix `A` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers taken from the input (2 <= n, m <= 50), and `A` is a n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.**
