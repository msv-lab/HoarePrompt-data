The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, the given code does not specify which loop this statement is part of, so we cannot determine the exact changes. Given the initial state, the only information we can extract from the `continue` statement is that it skips the remaining code in the current loop iteration.

The states of the variables `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j + 1]`, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, and `j` are not changed by the `continue` statement. The value of `j` remains `j_end_prev + 2`.

Output State: **`A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is included in `ops`, `j` is `j_end_prev + 2`**
