Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Condition Checking and Operations:**
   - The program checks if certain elements in the matrix \(A\) are `1` and includes them in the list `ops`. However, the condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is not necessary for determining whether a \(2 \times 2\) submatrix needs to be set to `1`. Instead, it should check if any of the four corners need to be flipped.
   - The current logic only appends operations if any of the four corners around a cell `(i, j)` are `1`. This does not guarantee that all `1`s in the matrix can be achieved by operations on \(2 \times 2\) submatrices.

2. **Operation Validity:**
   - The problem requires setting specific \(2 \times 2\) submatrices to all `1`s. The program does not ensure that the operations will cover all required `1`s in the matrix \(A\). It simply includes operations for cells that might need to be flipped, but it does not guarantee completeness or correctness.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the list of operations, but it does not account for the possibility that no valid sequence of operations exists. The output should be `-1` if it's impossible to transform \(B\) into \(A\), which the program does not handle correctly.

4. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The program does not correctly simulate the process of setting \(2 \times 2\) submatrices to `1`. For example, consider the following matrix \(A\):

     ```
     1 0
     0 1
     ```

     The correct sequence of operations would be to set the entire \(2 \times 2\) submatrix starting from \((1, 1)\). However, the current logic would not include this operation because it checks individual elements rather than the full \(2 \times 2\) submatrix.

To summarize, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure that \(B\) can be transformed into \(A\) through the specified operations, and it fails to handle cases where no such transformation is possible. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
