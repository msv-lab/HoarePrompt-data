Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each position `(i, j)` in the matrix `A` that satisfy the given conditions.
   - `i` remains `n - 2`, meaning the current value of `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2.
   - `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.
   - `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 1`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `ops` is not directly modified by the loop, but its content depends on the values in `A`.

6. **Matrix `A`:**
   - Since `A` is not modified within the loop, it remains the same.

Given these points, we can summarize the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop:

- `i` needs to be updated to `n - 1`.
- `n` and `m` remain the same.
- `A` remains the same.
- `ops` remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ops` contains all tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each position `(i, j)` in the matrix `A` that satisfy the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.**
