`ops` is a list that appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given the initial state, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is already in `ops` since the if condition was satisfied. Now, the code appends another tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `ops`. Therefore, `ops` will contain two tuples: `(i + 1, j + 1)` (from the if condition) and `(i + 1, j + 1)` (from the current operation). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `ops` contains the tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` and `(i + 1, j + 1)`, and `j` is now `j_end_prev + 1`.**
