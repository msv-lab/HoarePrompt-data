Output State: **`ops` contains all tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each position `(i, j)` in the matrix `A` that satisfy the condition `A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, `i` remains `n - 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`ops`**: The loop iterates over the columns of the matrix `A` and appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `ops` if any of the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` are met. Since the loop runs until all columns have been checked (i.e., `j` goes from `0` to `m-1`), `ops` will contain all such tuples.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` starts at `n-2` and is not modified within the loop, so it remains `n-2` after the loop completes.
- **`n`**: The variable `n` is defined in the initial state and is not modified within the loop, so it remains as specified.
- **`m`**: The variable `m` is defined in the initial state and is not modified within the loop, so it remains as specified.
- **`A`**: The matrix `A` is defined in the initial state and is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.

Since the loop checks each column and appends valid tuples to `ops` without any external modifications, the final state of `ops` will contain all required tuples, and other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `A`) will retain their initial values.
