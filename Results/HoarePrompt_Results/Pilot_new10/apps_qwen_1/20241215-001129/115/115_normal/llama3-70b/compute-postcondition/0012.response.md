The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop specified in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, and the condition `(A[0][j] == 1 or A[1][j] == 1 or A[0][j + 1] == 1 or (A[1][j + 1] == 1))` holds for `j = j_end + 1`**
