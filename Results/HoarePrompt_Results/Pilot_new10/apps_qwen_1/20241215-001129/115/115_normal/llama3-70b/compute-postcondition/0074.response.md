Functionality: **The function accepts an \(n \times m\) matrix \(A\) where each element is either 0 or 1, and \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers such that \(2 \le n, m \le 50\). It identifies all positions \((i, j)\) in the matrix where at least one of the four adjacent cells (top, bottom, left, right) is 1. These positions are stored in the list `ops`. If the length of `ops` exceeds 2500, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the length of `ops` followed by the coordinates of each position in `ops`.**
