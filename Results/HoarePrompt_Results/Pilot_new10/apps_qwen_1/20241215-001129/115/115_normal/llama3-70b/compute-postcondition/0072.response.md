Postcondition: ***`ops` is a list of tuples representing positions in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the given conditions. `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2. `m` is an integer between 2 and 50. `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1. If `len(ops) > 2500`, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the list `ops` remains unchanged.***
