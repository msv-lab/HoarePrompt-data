The given code initializes an empty list named `ops`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the matrix `A` also remains the same. Therefore, the only difference in the state is the addition of the empty list `ops`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an n x m matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list**
