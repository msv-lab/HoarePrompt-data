The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. This means that the value of `ops` changes, but the values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` remain the same. Therefore, the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` still hold.

Output State: **`A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, and the conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` remain true.**
