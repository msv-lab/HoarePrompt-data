Let's analyze the loop and its behavior step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all iterations.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `ops` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    for j in range(m - 1):
        if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
            continue
        if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
            ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
```

### Observations from Example Output States:
- After the loop executes 1 time, `ops` contains all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for positions \((i, j)\) that satisfy the condition.
- After the loop executes 2 times, `ops` still contains all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) that satisfy the condition.
- After the loop executes 3 times, `ops` still contains all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) that satisfy the condition.

### Final Analysis:
- The loop iterates over every possible position \((i, j)\) in the matrix \(A\) such that \(0 \leq i < n-1\) and \(0 \leq j < m-1\).
- It checks whether the elements \(A[i][j]\), \(A[i+1][j]\), \(A[i][j+1]\), and \(A[i+1][j+1]\) form a 2x2 submatrix of 1s. If they do, the loop skips appending any tuple.
- If any of these four elements are 1, the loop appends the tuple \((i + 1, j + 1)\) to the list `ops`.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, `ops` will contain all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for each position \((i, j)\) in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\).

### Output State:
**Output State: `ops` is a list containing all tuples \((i + 1, j + 1)\) for each position \((i, j)\) in the matrix \(A\) that satisfy the condition \(A[i][j] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j] == 1\) or \(A[i][j + 1] == 1\) or \(A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1\), `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.**
