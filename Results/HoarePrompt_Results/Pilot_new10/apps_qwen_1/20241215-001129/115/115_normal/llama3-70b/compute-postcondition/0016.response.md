Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(1, 1)]`
- The condition `(A[0][j] == 1 or A[1][j] == 1 or A[0][j + 1] == 1 or (A[1][j + 1] == 1))` holds for `j = j_end + 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m - 2`.
2. **Current State**: The loop is currently executing for some `j`. We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.
3. **Next Iteration**: The loop will continue if `j < m - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `j`**: Since the loop runs for `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, the value of `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
2. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `A`, `ops`) do not change within the loop. The condition mentioned does not affect the loop control variable `j` directly but may affect the matrix `A` inside the loop.

### Updated States:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains at least 2.
- `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` remains an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.
- `ops` remains a list containing the tuples `[(1, 1)]`.

Since the condition specified does not affect the loop control variable `j` directly, we only need to update `j` for the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1
- `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(1, 1)]`
- `j` is now `j + 1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(1, 1)]`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
