`ops` is a list that includes the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to `ops`. No other variables are affected. The state of `j` remains unchanged as `j_end_prev + 2`.

Output State: **`A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is included in `ops`, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is appended to `ops`, `j` is `j_end_prev + 2`.**
