The code `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`. These values are taken from the list `ops`, which is a non-empty list. The values of `n`, `m`, and the matrix `A` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, after executing the code, the values of `ops`, `n`, `m`, and `A` remain the same, but the console will display the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]`.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an \(n \times m\) matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, the console displays `op[0]` and `op[1]`**
