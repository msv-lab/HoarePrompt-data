The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since no changes are made to any variables within the loop body, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the contents of the `ops` list, so it stays as originally defined.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `j` is `m-1`, and `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` if `A[i][j] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j] == 1` or `A[i][j + 1] == 1` or `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
