According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `m - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `A[i][j]` is 1
- `A[i + 1][j]` is 1
- `A[i][j + 1]` is 1
- `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1
- The conditions `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` remain true
- `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` since the if condition is satisfied

The loop increments `j` by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was one value less than it will be in the next iteration.

Let's denote the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `j_end_prev`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_end_prev + 1`.

Since the loop continues as long as `j < m - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j_end_prev + 1` must be less than `m - 1`.

To summarize the adjustments needed:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j_end_prev + 1`.
- All other conditions remain the same.

State: **`A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, and `ops` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` since the if condition is satisfied, and `j` is now `j_end_prev + 1`**
