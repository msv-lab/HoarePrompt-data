Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is an `n x m` matrix where each element is either 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, and if the elements `A[0][j]`, `A[0][j+1]`, `A[1][j]`, and `A[1][j+1]` are all equal to 1, then the condition holds as is; otherwise, no changes occur in the variables.***
