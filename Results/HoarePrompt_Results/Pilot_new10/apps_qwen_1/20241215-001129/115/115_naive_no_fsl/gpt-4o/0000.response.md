Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Initialization of Matrix B**: The program initializes matrix \( B \) with zeros correctly, but it does not handle the case where the initial values of \( B \) are already set to 1 due to previous operations. This means that the program might incorrectly report that it's impossible to achieve the target matrix \( A \) even if it is possible.

2. **Logic for Setting Elements to 1**: The program only sets elements of \( B \) to 1 if the corresponding elements in \( A \) are 1. However, it does not consider the possibility of setting elements to 1 in a way that might affect adjacent cells outside the \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix. For example, if \( A \) requires setting a specific cell to 1, the program might miss this if the surrounding cells do not form a complete \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix that can be set to 1.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, if \( A \) has a single 1 in a corner, the program might not be able to set that cell to 1 using the given operations since no \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix can cover a corner cell.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 1
1 0
```
In this case, the program will output:
```
-1
```
But it is actually possible to transform \( B \) into \( A \) by performing the operation on the entire \( 2 \times 2 \) submatrix, which would result in:
```
1 1
1 1
```
Then, setting \( B[1][1] \) to 0, we get:
```
1 1
1 0
```

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and is thus incorrect.
