The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user where the first line contains a single integer \( n \) (\( 1 \le n \le 100 \)) representing the number of elements in the array, and the second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_i \) (\( 1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 1000 \)) representing the array written by Giraffe. Based on the input, the function processes the array and returns a value. Since no specific output cases are provided, the function's return value is not explicitly detailed here.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers from the input, processes the array, and returns a value based on the array elements.**
