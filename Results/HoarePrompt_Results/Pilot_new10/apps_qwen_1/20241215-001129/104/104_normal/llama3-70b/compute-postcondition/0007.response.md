Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `max_erase` is `max(max_erase_initial, j - 1)`. If all elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j-1` satisfy the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for each `k` in the range `[i, j)`, then the condition holds. Otherwise, the same conditions apply without the satisfaction check since there is no else action specified.***
