The code `max_erase = 0` simply assigns the integer value `0` to the variable `max_erase`. This does not affect the values of `n` or the contents of the list `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of integers created from user input; `max_erase` is 0**
