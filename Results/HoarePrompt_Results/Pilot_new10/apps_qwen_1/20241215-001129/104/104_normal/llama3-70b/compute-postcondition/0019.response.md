Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` must have at least one element beyond index 1. If all elements in the subarray from index `i` to `j-1` satisfy the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i`, then `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `j - i - 1`. Otherwise, the value of `max_erase` remains unchanged.***
