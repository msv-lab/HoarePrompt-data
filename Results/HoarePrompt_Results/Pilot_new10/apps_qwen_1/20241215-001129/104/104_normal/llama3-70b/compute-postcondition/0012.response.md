The code updates `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state, `j` is 3 and `i` is 0. So, `j - i - 1` equals 2. Since `max_erase` is at least 1, the new value of `max_erase` will be the maximum of 1 and 2, which is 2.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is 2, and `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is 2, and `j` is 3**
