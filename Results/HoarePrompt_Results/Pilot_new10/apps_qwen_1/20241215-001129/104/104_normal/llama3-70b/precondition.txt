The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer \( n \) where \( 1 \le n \le 100 \), representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_i \) where \( 1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3 \), representing the array written by Giraffe.
