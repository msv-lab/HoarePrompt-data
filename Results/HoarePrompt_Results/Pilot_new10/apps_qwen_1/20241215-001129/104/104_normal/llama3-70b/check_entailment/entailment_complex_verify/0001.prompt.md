You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
    print(max_erase)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the array is already consecutive or nearly consecutive. Let's consider an example:

### Example:
**Input:**
```
6
1 2 4 5 7 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs `2`.

### Analysis:
The program checks all possible subarrays to find the maximum length of a subarray that maintains the property `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` for all `k` in the subarray. In this example, the subarray `[4, 5]` does maintain the property, but the subarray `[2, 4]` does not. The program incorrectly identifies the subarray `[1, 2]` or `[7, 8]` as valid, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program needs to identify the longest subarray that can be erased while still allowing the original array to be restored. This involves identifying gaps in the sequence and ensuring that the remaining elements can still form a valid increasing sequence.

A correct approach would involve identifying the longest segment that can be erased without violating the increasing order constraint. This can be achieved by identifying the longest gap in the sequence and erasing all elements between these gaps.

Since the provided program does not correctly handle such cases, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer \( n \) (\( 1 \le n \le 100 \)) representing the number of elements in the array. The second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_i \) (\( 1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 1000 \)) representing the array written by Giraffe.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers, `max_erase` is the maximum value of `j - i - 1` over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` and `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n` such that for all `k` in the range `[i, j)`, the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds, `i` and `j` are the indices used during the last iteration of the loop that resulted in updating `max_erase`.
    print(max_erase)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers from the input. It then iterates through all possible subarrays of the given array to find the longest subarray where the difference between each element and the starting element of the subarray is equal to the index difference. The function returns the length of the longest such subarray minus one.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
