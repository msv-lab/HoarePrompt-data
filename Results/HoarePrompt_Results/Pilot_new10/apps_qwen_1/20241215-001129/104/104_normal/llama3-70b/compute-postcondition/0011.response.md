Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `max_erase` is at least 1.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - The loop will check if the condition `a[j] - a[i] == j - i` holds for all `k` in the range from `i` to `j`.
   - For `i = 0` and `j = 2`, the condition checks `a[2] - a[0] == 2 - 0` or `a[2] - a[0] == 2`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 3 (since it was 2 and we increment it).

5. **Updated States**:
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `max_erase` remains at least 1.
   - `j` is now 3.

**Final State**:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_erase` is at least 1.
- `j` is 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is at least 1, and `j` is 3**
