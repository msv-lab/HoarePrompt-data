Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) and an array of \( n \) integers from the input. It then iterates through all possible subarrays of the given array to find the longest subarray where the difference between each element and the starting element of the subarray is equal to the index difference. The function returns the length of the longest such subarray minus one.**
