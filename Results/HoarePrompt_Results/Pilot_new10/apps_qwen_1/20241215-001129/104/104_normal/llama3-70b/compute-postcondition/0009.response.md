The code updates the value of `max_erase` by comparing its current value with `j - i - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `j - i - 1` equals `2 - 0 - 1`, which is 1. Since `max_erase` is initially at least 1 (as it is `max(max_erase_initial, 1)`), the new value of `max_erase` will be `max(1, 1)`, which remains 1.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by this code. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `max_erase` is 1, and `j` is 2**
