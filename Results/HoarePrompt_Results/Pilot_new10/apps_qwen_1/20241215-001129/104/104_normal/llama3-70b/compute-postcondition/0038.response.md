Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- \( n \) is an integer between 1 and 100.
- \( a \) is a list of integers.
- \( i \) is 2.
- \( \text{max\_erase} \) is the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) where \( j \) ranges from \( i + 1 \) to \( n + 1 \) and the condition \( a[k] - a[i] == k - i \) holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\).

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n + 1 \) and checks the condition \( a[k] - a[i] == k - i \) for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\). If the condition holds, it updates \( \text{max\_erase} \) to the maximum of its current value and \( j - i - 1 \).

### Key Observations
1. **Condition Check**: The loop only updates \( \text{max\_erase} \) if the condition \( a[k] - a[i] == k - i \) holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\).
2. **No Change**: If the condition does not hold for any \( j \), \( \text{max\_erase} \) remains unchanged.
3. **Final Value of \( \text{max\_erase} \)**: After all iterations, \( \text{max\_erase} \) will be the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) for which the condition holds.

### Final Output State
After all iterations of the loop, the following will be true:
- \( n \) is an integer between 1 and 100.
- \( a \) is a list of integers.
- \( i \) is 2.
- \( \text{max\_erase} \) is the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) where \( j \) ranges from \( i + 1 \) to \( n + 1 \) and the condition \( a[k] - a[i] == k - i \) holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\).

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `max_erase` is the maximum value of \( j - i - 1 \) where \( j \) ranges from \( i + 1 \) to \( n + 1 \) and the condition `a[k] - a[i] == k - i` holds for all \( k \) in the range \([i, j)\).**
