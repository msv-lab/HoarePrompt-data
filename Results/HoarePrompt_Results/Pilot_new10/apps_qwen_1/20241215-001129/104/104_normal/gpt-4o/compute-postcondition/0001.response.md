The input is a list of integers representing the array \(a\) of length \(n\), where \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3\). The variable `n` is an input integer.

The code snippet reads input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the input, which is a string of space-separated integers, is converted to a list of integers. The length of this list will be equal to the value of `n`.

After executing the code, the list `a` is updated to contain the integers from the input, and the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers `[int1, int2, ..., intn]` where each `inti` is an integer and there are exactly `n` such integers.**
