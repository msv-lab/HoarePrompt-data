The code initializes the variable `max_erase` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers `[int1, int2, ..., intn]` where each `inti` is an integer and there are exactly `n` such integers; `max_erase` is 0.**
