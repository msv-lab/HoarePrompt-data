Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`. This means the loop will start from `i = 1` and go up to `i = n-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the value of `i` must be less than `n`. Specifically, the loop will run for values of `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

3. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `a`: A list of integers `[int1, int2, ..., intn]` with exactly `n` elements.
   - `max_erase`: Initialized to 0.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1`, `i` should be set to 1 initially.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once.

Given these points, we can conclude that the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the final state adjustment required for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**.
