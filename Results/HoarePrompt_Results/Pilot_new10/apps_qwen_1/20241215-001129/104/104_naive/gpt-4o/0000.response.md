Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the maximum number of consecutive elements can be erased while still allowing the array to be restored. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum gap between consecutive elements and subtracts one, but this approach does not account for the possibility of erasing more elements in certain cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 3 4 6 7
```
In this case, the program will output `2`, because the maximum gap between consecutive elements is `2` (between `3` and `6`), and thus it concludes that the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased is `2`.

However, the correct answer should be `4`. JATC can erase the elements `[3, 4]` and still allow Giraffe to restore the array to `[1, 6, 7]`. This is because the array is strictly increasing, and there are no other constraints preventing the erasure of these elements.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and hence is incorrect.
