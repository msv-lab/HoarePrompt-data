The code `x = p[x] - 1` updates the value of `x` by subtracting 1 from the value of `p[x]`. However, the initial value of `p[1]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `x`. The other variables (`visited[1]` and `cycle`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `p[1] - 1`, `visited[1]` is `True`, `cycle` is `[1]`**
