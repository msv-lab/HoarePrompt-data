#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of skewers. The second line contains a permutation of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} where 1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n. The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` if `n` > 0, otherwise an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the loop execution, `cycle` is the last cycle found if `visited[i]` is `False`, and `i` is `n` if the loop executes `n` times, otherwise `i` is less than `n`.
    no_reverse_components = sum(all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle) for cycle in cycles)
    if (len(cycles) == 1) :
        print(0)

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`no_reverse_components` is the sum of `1` for each cycle in `cycles` where all elements in `b` at those cycle indices are `0`. `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers from `1` to `n` if `n` > `0`, otherwise an empty list, `b` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the loop execution, `cycle` is the last cycle found if `visited[i]` is `False`, and `i` is `n` if the loop executes `n` times, otherwise `i` is less than `n`. If the length of `cycles` is exactly `1`, `0` is printed to the console. Otherwise, `no_reverse_components` is printed if it is greater than `0`, otherwise `1` is printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of skewers), `p` (a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`), and `b` (a sequence of zeros and ones). It finds all cycles in the permutation `p` and counts the number of cycles where all corresponding elements in `b` are zeros. If there is only one cycle, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of such cycles unless the count is 0, in which case it prints 1.
