The code `visited[x] = True` sets the value of `visited[x]` to `True`. The variable `x` is not directly modified by this line of code, but rather its corresponding value in the dictionary `visited` is set to `True`. The output state should reflect this change.

Output State: **`visited[x]` is `True`**
