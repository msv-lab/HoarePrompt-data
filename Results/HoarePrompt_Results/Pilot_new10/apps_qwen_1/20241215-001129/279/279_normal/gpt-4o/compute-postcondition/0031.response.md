The code appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. The value of `x` is 1 (as per the initial state). Therefore, the list `cycle` changes to contain `[1]`.

Output State: **`input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is an empty list, `visited` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing all the cycles found during the execution of the loop with the last cycle being `cycle`, `cycle` is now `[1]`**
