The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.

The function has two cases for its output:

- Case_1: If `b` contains only 0s, the function returns an error message indicating that the sequence `b` cannot consist entirely of zeros.
- Case_2: Otherwise, the function returns the sequence `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters `n`, `p`, and `b` and return either an error message if `b` consists entirely of zeros or return the sequence `b` otherwise.
