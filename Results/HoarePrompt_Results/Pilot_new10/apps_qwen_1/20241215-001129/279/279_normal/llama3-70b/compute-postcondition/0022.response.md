The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans` without changing its value. The initial state of `ans` is defined as the count of indices `i` where either `p[i] != i + 1` or `b[i] == 0`. This value remains unchanged by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `ans` is the count of indices `i` where either `p[i] != i + 1` or `b[i] == 0`.**
