`ans` is incremented by 1. The original state of `ans` was the original value plus 2 because `b[i]` is 0 (provided that `p[i]` is not equal to \(i + 1\)), and if `p[i]` equals \(i + 1\), the original state of `ans` plus 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the original value plus 3 if `p[i]` is not equal to \(i + 1\), and the original value plus 2 if `p[i]` equals \(i + 1\). The states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `i` is \(k + 2\), `ans` is the original value plus 3 if `p[i]` is not equal to \(i + 1\), and the original value plus 2 if `p[i]` equals \(i + 1\)**.
