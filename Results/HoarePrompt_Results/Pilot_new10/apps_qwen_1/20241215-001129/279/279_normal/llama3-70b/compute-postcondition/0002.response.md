The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts each element into an integer, storing them in the list `b`. The initial state of `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `b` is a sequence of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s. After executing this code, the input line will be split into individual elements, which are then converted to integers and stored in the list `b`.

Since the input line is not specified, we can only say that `b` will be updated to contain `n` integers (either 0 or 1) based on the input. The initial values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of `n` integers consisting only of 0s and 1s**.
