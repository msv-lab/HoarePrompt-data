Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the given ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). The program finds the minimum number of lemons that can be used (`min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`), which ensures that the number of apples and pears used will also meet the required ratio. The total number of fruits used is then calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This approach handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and examples provided.
