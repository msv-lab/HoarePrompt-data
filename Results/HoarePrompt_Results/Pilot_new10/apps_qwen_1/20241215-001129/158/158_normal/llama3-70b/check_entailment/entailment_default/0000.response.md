Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears, then determines the maximum number of sets of fruits (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) that can be used. The function calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, ensuring that the number of lemons, apples, and pears used does not exceed the available quantities. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used, which is `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`.

This approach handles all potential cases as specified:
- If there are not enough lemons, apples, or pears to form a complete set, the function correctly returns 0.
- For any valid input, the function ensures that the ratio 1:2:4 is maintained and calculates the maximum possible number of fruits used.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote.
