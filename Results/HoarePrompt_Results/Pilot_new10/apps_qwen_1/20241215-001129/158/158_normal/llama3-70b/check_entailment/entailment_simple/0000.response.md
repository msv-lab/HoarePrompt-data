Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it meets all the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes three inputs (a, b, c) representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. Each input is an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000).

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used according to the ratio 1:2:4. Specifically, it determines the minimum number of lemons (`min_lemon`) that can be used without violating the ratio constraints. Since for each lemon, there must be exactly 2 apples and 4 pears, the limiting factor will be the smallest value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

3. **Total Calculation**: The program then calculates the total number of fruits used, which is `min_lemon` (lemons) + `min_lemon * 2` (apples) + `min_lemon * 4` (pears). This ensures that the total number of fruits used adheres to the ratio and uses the maximum possible quantity of each type of fruit.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` are all 0, the minimum of them will be 0, resulting in an output of 0, which matches the requirement.
   - If any of the inputs do not meet the ratio constraints, the minimum value calculation will ensure that no invalid combinations are considered.

Since the program accurately follows the logic of finding the maximum number of fruits that can be used while maintaining the required ratio and handles all edge cases appropriately, the program is correct according to the problem description.
