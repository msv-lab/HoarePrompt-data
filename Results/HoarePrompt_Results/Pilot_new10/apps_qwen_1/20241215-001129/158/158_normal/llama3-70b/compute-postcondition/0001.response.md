The code `b = int(input())` assigns the integer value entered by the user to the variable `b`. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and the precondition for `c` is still valid. Therefore, the updated state is that `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is now an integer input by the user, and `c` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= c <= 1000.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `c` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= c <= 1000**
