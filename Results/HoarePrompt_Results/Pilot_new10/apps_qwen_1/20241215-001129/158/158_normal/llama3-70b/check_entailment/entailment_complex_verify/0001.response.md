Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both correctly describe the functionality of the program. The program calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote while maintaining the required ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). The annotation clearly states that the function reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This approach ensures that the number of apples and pears used will meet the required ratio. The final output is the sum of the lemons, apples, and pears used, which is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This matches the problem description and the provided examples, confirming that the original assessment is accurate.
