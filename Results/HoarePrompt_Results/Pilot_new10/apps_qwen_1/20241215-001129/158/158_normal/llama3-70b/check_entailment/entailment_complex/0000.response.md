Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, ensuring they are within the specified range (1 to 1000).

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of compote portions (sets of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) that can be made using the formula `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This ensures that the number of each type of fruit used is within the required ratio and respects the indivisibility constraint (fruits cannot be broken).

3. **Output Calculation**: The program then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote using the formula `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This accounts for the requirement of having exactly 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears for each portion of the compote.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where no fruits can be used (i.e., when `min_lemon` is 0). In such cases, the output is 0, which aligns with the problem description.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic and constraints specified in the problem description, making it correct.
