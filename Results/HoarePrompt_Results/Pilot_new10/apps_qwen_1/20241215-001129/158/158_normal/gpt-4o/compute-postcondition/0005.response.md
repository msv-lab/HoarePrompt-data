The code prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`. The value of `max_lemons` is determined by `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. After printing `total_fruits`, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits` are updated according to the code execution.

Since the code only prints `total_fruits` and does not assign a new value to `total_fruits` or any other variables, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `max_lemons` also remains unchanged from its initial calculation. The only change is the printed value of `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is printed as `max_lemons * 7`**
