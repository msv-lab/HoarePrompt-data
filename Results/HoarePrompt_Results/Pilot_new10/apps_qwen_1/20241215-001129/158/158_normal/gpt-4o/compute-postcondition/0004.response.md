The code sets `total_fruits` to the value of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, plus `max_lemons` multiplied by 2, plus `max_lemons` multiplied by 4. Here, `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but `max_lemons` and `total_fruits` are now defined.

To calculate `max_lemons`, we need to determine the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Once `max_lemons` is determined, `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**
