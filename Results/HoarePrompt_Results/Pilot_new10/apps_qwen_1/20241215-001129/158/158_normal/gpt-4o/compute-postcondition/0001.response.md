`b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `a` remains an integer input, and `c` remains a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is a non-negative integer**
