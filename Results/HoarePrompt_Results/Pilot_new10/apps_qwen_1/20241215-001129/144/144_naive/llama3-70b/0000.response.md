Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of mex for the given array. The logic in the program fails to handle cases where the array has duplicate values. Specifically, the program increments `mex` only when `num` equals `mex`, but it should also consider cases where `num` is greater than `mex`. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 2 2
```

The expected output is 3 because Alyona can decrease each element to 1, resulting in the array [1, 1, 1], and the mex would be 2. However, the program incorrectly outputs 2 because it breaks the loop when `num` is 2, which is equal to `mex`.

A correct approach would be to keep track of the smallest unused value (`mex`) and ensure that it is incremented properly even when there are duplicates in the array. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    mex = 1
    for num in arr:
        if num >= mex:
            mex += 1
    print(mex)
```

This corrected version ensures that `mex` is incremented for each element that is greater than or equal to `mex`, handling all potential cases correctly.
