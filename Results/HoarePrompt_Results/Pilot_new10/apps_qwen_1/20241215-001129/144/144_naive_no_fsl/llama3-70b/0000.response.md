Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the array are equal to the current `mex` value. For example, consider the input:

```
3
2 2 2
```

According to the problem description, Alyona can decrease any element to any positive integer less than or equal to its original value. Therefore, she can decrease all elements to 1, making the array [1, 1, 1]. The mex of this array is 2. However, the program will output 3 because it increments `mex` only when the current element is equal to `mex`, and breaks the loop if the element is greater than `mex`. Thus, the program does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of mex in this case.
