The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it directly.

Since the initial state of `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`, the value of `n` is still within this range. The variable `a` is updated to a list of integers read from the input, with the length of the list being equal to `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**
