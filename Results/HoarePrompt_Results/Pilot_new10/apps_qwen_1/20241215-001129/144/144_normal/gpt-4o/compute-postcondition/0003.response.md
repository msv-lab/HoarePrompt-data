The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `mex`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the contents of the list `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `mex` is now set to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `mex` is 1**
