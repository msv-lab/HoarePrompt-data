Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `mex` is either 2 if the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, or remains 1 otherwise.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for num in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - The variable `num` takes the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration.
   - The state of `mex` changes based on the condition: if `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` becomes 2; otherwise, it remains 1.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `a`, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The length `n` of the list `a` does not change.
   - The list `a` remains sorted in ascending order.
   - `mex` will be updated based on the next value of `num`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `num` must exist in the list `a`.
   - Since the list `a` is finite and sorted, and `num` has already processed one element, there is always a next value unless `num` has reached the end of the list.
   - Therefore, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the value of `num` to the next element in the list `a`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `n` is still within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
- `mex` will be updated based on the next value of `num`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, and `mex` is either 2 if the next value of `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, or remains 1 otherwise.**
