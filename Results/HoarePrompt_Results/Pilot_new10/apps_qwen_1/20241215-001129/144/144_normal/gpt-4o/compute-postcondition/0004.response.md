According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`, specifically on its length and content.

1. The list `a` must have at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `a`.
2. Since `a` is already described as a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, we don't need to adjust the sorting or the range of values within `a`.
3. The variable `mex` is initially set to 1, but this value will be updated within the loop based on the elements of `a`.

Given these points, the key adjustment needed is to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element, as this is the condition that allows the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, and `a` must have at least one element, `mex` is 1**
