The code `mex += 1` increases the value of `mex` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if `num` (the next element in the list `a`) is greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` is increased by 1; otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged, the current value of `mex` is increased by 1 regardless of the initial value of `mex`. The value of `num` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated value of `mex` is its original value plus 1, and `num` retains its initial state.

Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mex` is its original value plus 1**
