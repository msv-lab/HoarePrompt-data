The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The initial state is that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. After sorting, the list `a` will contain the same integers but in sorted order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**
