To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `num` and `mex` are integers. If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` is increased by 1. There is no else part, so no other changes occur to the variables.
- Loop: 
  ```python
  for num in a:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: We need to consider the state at the start of the current iteration.
2. **Condition Check**: The loop checks if the current `num` (from the list `a`) is greater than or equal to `mex`.
3. **Effect of Condition**:
   - If `num >= mex`, then `mex` is increased by 1.
   - If `num < mex`, then `mex` remains unchanged.
4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the new value of `num` from the list `a`.

### Determining the New State:

- Let's denote the current `num` as `num_current` and the corresponding `mex` as `mex_current`.
- After processing `num_current`, the next `num` in the list `a` will be `num_next`.
- The condition for the next iteration will depend on whether `num_next >= mex_current` or `num_next < mex_current`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `num_current` and `mex_current` from the previous iteration, we need to generalize the state.

### Generalized State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

- The next `num` (`num_next`) will be processed in the loop.
- Depending on whether `num_next >= mex_current`, `mex` will either be `mex_current + 1` or remain `mex_current`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration can be summarized as follows:

**State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a` (let's call it `num_next`), and `mex` must satisfy the condition based on the value of `num_next` compared to `mex_current`**.

Since we don't have specific values for `num_current` and `mex_current`, we represent them symbolically:

**State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, and `mex` must be such that if `num` (next element) is greater than or equal to `mex`, then `mex` is increased by 1; otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged**.

This is the most precise representation of the state before the next iteration, considering the given conditions and the loop structure.
