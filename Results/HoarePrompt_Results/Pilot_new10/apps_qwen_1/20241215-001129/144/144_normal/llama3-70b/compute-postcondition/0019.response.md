The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement is directly inside, its impact is minimal and primarily indicates the end of a loop or block. The values of the variables `arr`, `n`, `mex`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 2, and `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
