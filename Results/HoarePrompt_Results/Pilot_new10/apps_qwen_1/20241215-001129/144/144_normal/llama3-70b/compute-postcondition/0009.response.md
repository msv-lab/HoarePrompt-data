The code `break` does not change any variable values; it only exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code, the only effect is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 1, `num` is not equal to 1, and the current value of `num` is greater than 1.**
