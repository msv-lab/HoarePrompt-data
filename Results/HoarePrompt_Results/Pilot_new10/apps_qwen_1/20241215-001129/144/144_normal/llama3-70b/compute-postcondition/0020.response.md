Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 2, and `num` is the next element in `arr`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the relationship remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the if part.***
