`mex` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `mex` is 2, so it becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 3, and `num` is the next element in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 3, and `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
