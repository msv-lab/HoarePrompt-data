`mex` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `mex` is 1, so after executing `mex += 1`, the value of `mex` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `n`, and `num`) are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 2, the current value of `num` is equal to 1**
