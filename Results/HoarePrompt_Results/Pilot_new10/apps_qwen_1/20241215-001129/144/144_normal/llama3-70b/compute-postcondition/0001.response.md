The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list of these integers. This affects the variable `arr` and the value of `n` is no longer directly accessible since the user needs to provide the new input.

Let's denote the input provided by the user as a sequence of space-separated integers, for example, "1 2 3 4". After the code executes, `arr` will be a list containing these integers, and `n` will be reset because the user input was used to create the list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is the new integer input from the standard input**
