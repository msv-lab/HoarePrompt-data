The code increments the value of `mex` by 1. The initial value of `mex` is 2, so after the increment, `mex` becomes 3. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 3, and `num` is the next element in the list `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 3, and `num` is the next element in the list `arr`.**
