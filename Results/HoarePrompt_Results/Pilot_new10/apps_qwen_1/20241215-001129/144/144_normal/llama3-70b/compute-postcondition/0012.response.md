According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, and `mex` is 2.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- If the current value of `num` is equal to 1, `mex` remains unchanged (which is 2).
- If the current value of `num` is greater than 1, `mex` is set to 2.

Given that the loop is iterating over the elements of `arr`, we need to consider the value of `num` at the end of the previous iteration. Since `mex` is set to 2 if `num` is greater than 1, it implies that the previous value of `num` was either 1 or greater than 1. 

If the previous value of `num` was 1, then `mex` would still be 2. For the loop to continue, the next value of `num` must be read from the list `arr`.

If the previous value of `num` was greater than 1, then `mex` is already 2, and the loop can continue with the next value of `num` from the list `arr`.

In both cases, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer input from standard input, `mex` is 2, and `num` is the next element in the list `arr`**.
