Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum possible value of mex for the given array. The logic in the program fails to handle cases where the array has duplicate values and where the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array needs to be found. The output hints support this, indicating that the function sorts the array and finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array, which is not the correct approach for finding the mex value. The corrected version provided in the explanation should be used instead to ensure the program works correctly for all potential cases.
