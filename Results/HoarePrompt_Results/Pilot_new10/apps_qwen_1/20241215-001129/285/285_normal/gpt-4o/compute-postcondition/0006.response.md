`remaining_after_houses` is subtracted by `b * car_cost`, and the result is assigned to `remaining_after_cars`. However, the values of `remaining_after_houses` and `car_cost` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `remaining_after_cars` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`**
