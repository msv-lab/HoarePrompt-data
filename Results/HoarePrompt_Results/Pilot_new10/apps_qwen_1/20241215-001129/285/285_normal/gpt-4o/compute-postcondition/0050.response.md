To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Variables Involved:** `a`, `b`, `remaining_after_cars`, `remaining_after_houses`, `car_cost`, `computer_cost`.
- **Initial Values:**
  - `a` is 1.
  - `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses`.
  - `b` remains 0 initially.
  - `remaining_after_houses` is `n - house_cost`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
    remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
    if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
        return 'YES'
```

### Observations from Provided Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration:**
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` remains 0.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `n - house_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`.
   - `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`.

2. **After 2 iterations:**
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` is 1.
   - If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, the function does nothing and retains the same state as the precondition.

3. **After 3 iterations:**
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` is 2.
   - `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`.
   - If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the function returns 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

### Conclusion:
- The loop continues to decrement `remaining_after_cars` by `car_cost` until either `remaining_after_cars` becomes 0 or `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0` is true.
- The loop terminates when `b` reaches the maximum possible value, which is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

### Final Output State:
- **If the loop executes fully:**
  - `a` is 1.
  - `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
  - `remaining_after_cars` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`.
  - If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns the state where `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.

- **If the loop does not execute (due to `remaining_after_houses < car_cost`):**
  - `a` is 1.
  - `b` is 0.
  - `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses`.
  - `remaining_after_houses` is `n - house_cost`.

### Final Output State:
**Output State:**
- `a` is 1.
- `b` is `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (remaining_after_houses // car_cost) * car_cost`.
- If `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`, the function returns 'YES'.
- Otherwise, the function returns the state where `remaining_after_cars` is not divisible by `computer_cost`.
