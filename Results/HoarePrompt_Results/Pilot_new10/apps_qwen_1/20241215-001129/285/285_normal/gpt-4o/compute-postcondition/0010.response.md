Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Initial Variables and Conditions:**
   - `remaining_after_cars` is calculated as `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.
   - The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0` holds true at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The for loop iterates over `b` from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, `b` must be less than `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was one less than its current value.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop increments `b` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The new value of `b` will be `b + 1`.
   - The new value of `remaining_after_cars` will be recalculated as `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`.
   - The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we can now adjust the states:

- The new value of `b` is `b + 1`.
- The new value of `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`.
- The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0` must still hold true.

Therefore, the updated states are:

**State: **`remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost` and `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`**.
