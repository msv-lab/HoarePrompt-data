The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns 'YES' for any value of `n` within the specified range and returns 'NO' if `n` is outside this range.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and return 'YES', unless `n` is outside this range, in which case it returns 'NO'.
