The code updates the value of `remaining_after_cars` to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. The initial state tells us that `remaining_after_cars` was initially set to `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost` and `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`. After running the code, the value of `remaining_after_cars` changes to `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`.

Since the initial value of `remaining_after_cars` was `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost`, subtracting `b * car_cost` instead of `(b + 1) * car_cost` means the new value of `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (b + 1) * car_cost - b * car_cost = remaining_after_houses - (b + 1 + b) * car_cost = remaining_after_houses - (2b + 1) * car_cost`.

The condition `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `computer_cost`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - (2b + 1) * car_cost`; `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost != 0`**
