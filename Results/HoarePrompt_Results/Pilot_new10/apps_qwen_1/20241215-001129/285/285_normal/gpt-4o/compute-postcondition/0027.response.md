The code subtracts `b * car_cost` from `remaining_after_houses` and assigns the result to `remaining_after_cars`. Given the initial state:

- `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0
- `b` is 1
- `a` is 1
- `remaining_after_cars` is equal to `remaining_after_houses`
- `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0

After executing the code, `remaining_after_cars` becomes `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Since `b` is 1, this simplifies to `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0
- `b` is 1
- `a` is 1
- `remaining_after_cars` is now `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`
- `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0 (since the operation did not affect the modulo operation)

Output State: **`remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to 0, `b` is 1, `a` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - car_cost`, and `remaining_after_cars % computer_cost` is not equal to 0**
