`remaining_after_cars` is assigned the value of `remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`. Given that `b` is 0, the equation simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 0 * car_cost`, which further simplifies to `remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses`.

The initial state is:
- `a` is 1
- `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`
- `b` remains 0
- `remaining_after_houses` is `n - house_cost`

After the code executes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged, but `remaining_after_houses` becomes `remaining_after_cars`. Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` is 1
- `remaining_after_cars` is `n - house_cost`
- `b` remains 0
- `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`

Output State: **`a` is 1, `remaining_after_cars` is `n - house_cost`, `b` remains 0, `remaining_after_houses` must be greater than or equal to `car_cost`**
