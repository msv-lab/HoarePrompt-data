The code `print('YES')` does not affect the values of the variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is `b_prev + 1`, `c` is \(\left( n - 1234567 - (b_prev + 1) * 123456 \right) // 1234\), print statement executes 'YES'**
