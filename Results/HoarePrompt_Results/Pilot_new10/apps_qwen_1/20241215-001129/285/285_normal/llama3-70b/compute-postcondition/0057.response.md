The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some condition related to the integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.

Given the constraints, we need to consider what the function might be returning without knowing the exact logic inside the function. However, based on typical problem structures, the function could return an integer, a string, or another type of value.

Since no specific output cases are provided, we can only state that the function returns a value within the specified range or context.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value.**
