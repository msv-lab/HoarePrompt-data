`c` is assigned the value `(n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234`. Given the initial conditions, `a` is 1, and `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1. Since `b` was previously defined as `b + 1`, its current value is `b + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is greater than or equal to 1234567.

Substituting the known values:
- `a = 1`
- `b = b + 1`

The expression for `c` simplifies to:
\[ c = (n - 1 \cdot 1234567 - (b + 1) \cdot 123456) // 1234 \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than or equal to 1234567, `a` is 1, `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1, `c` is \((n - 1 * 1234567 - (b + 1) * 123456) // 1234\)**
