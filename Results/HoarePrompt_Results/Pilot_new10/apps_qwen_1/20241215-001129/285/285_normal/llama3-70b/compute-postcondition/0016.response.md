The `exit()` function is used to terminate the program immediately. Since the code does not assign any new values to the existing variables or perform any operations on them, all the variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is -98, `b` is \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456\), `c` is \((n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234**
