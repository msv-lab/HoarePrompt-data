The code prints 'YES', but does not change any variable values or affect any other operations. Therefore, the only change is the printed statement, which is not included in the variable states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is -98, `b` is \((n - a \times 1234567) // 123456\), `c` is \((n - a \times 1234567 - b \times 123456) // 1234**, printed statement is 'YES'.
