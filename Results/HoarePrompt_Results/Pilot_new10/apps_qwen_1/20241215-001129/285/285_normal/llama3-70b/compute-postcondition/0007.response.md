Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than or equal to 123456, `c` is equal to (n - a * 1234567 - b * 123456) // 1234. If the equation (a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234) equals `n`, then 'YES' is printed to the console. Otherwise, no additional changes occur and the function continues execution with the original values of `n` and `c`.***
