The `exit()` function call does not affect the values of the variables; it simply exits the current context. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2,469,134, `a` is 2, `b` is \( b_k + 2 \), `c` is \(\left( n - 2716046 - 123456b_k \right) // 1234\)**
