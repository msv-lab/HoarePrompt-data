Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program systematically checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers to see if they sum up to the initial game-coin score `n`. The program correctly iterates over possible values of `a` (number of houses), `b` (number of cars), and calculates `c` (number of computers) accordingly. For each combination, it checks if the total cost matches `n`. If a valid combination is found, it prints "YES" and exits. If no valid combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO". Since the program handles all possible valid inputs and checks all combinations within the given constraints, it will correctly determine whether Kolya could have spent all of his initial `n` game-coins buying only houses, cars, and computers. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
