Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is exactly divisible by the cost of a single house (1,234,567). In such cases, the program will incorrectly return "NO" because it only checks combinations involving at least one car and one computer. 

For example, consider the input `n = 1234567`. The program should return "YES" because Kolya could have bought exactly one house and no cars or computers. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.
