Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program iterates through all possible combinations of houses (`a`), cars (`b`), and computers (`c`) to check if there exists a combination that sums up to `n`. The outer loop iterates over possible values of `a`, the middle loop iterates over possible values of `b` for each `a`, and the innermost calculation determines `c`. If a valid combination is found, the program prints "YES" and exits, otherwise it prints "NO" after checking all possibilities. This approach ensures that all potential cases are considered, and the logic is sound for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
