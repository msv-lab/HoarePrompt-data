Postcondition: **`total` is `v[0] + v[1]` if both elements in `v` are less than or equal to `mid`, otherwise it is `v[0] + min(v[1], mid)`; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `s` is the second integer entered by the user; `v` is a list of two integers sorted in ascending order; `low` is 0; `high` is 0; `mid` is 0; the sum of the minimum values of each element in `v` with `low` equals `s`.**
