Postcondition: ***`total` is the minimum total such that `total >= s` and no further iterations of the loop would change this value. If the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`, the printed value is `-1`. Otherwise, the sum of the minimum values of each element in `v` with `low` equals `s`.***
