You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and s, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of kegs and the volume of the glass, respectively. Additionally, there is a list of n integers v, where each v_i (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9) represents the volume of the i-th keg.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `total` is `v[0] + v[1]` if both elements in `v` are less than or equal to `mid`, otherwise it is `v[0] + min(v[1], mid)`; `n` is the first integer entered by the user; `s` is the second integer entered by the user; `v` is a list of two integers sorted in ascending order; `low` is 0; `high` is 0; `mid` is 0. The final value of `total` is the minimum total such that `total >= s` and no further iterations of the loop would change this value.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`total` is the minimum total such that `total >= s` and no further iterations of the loop would change this value. If the sum of the minimum of `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`, the printed value is `-1`. Otherwise, the sum of the minimum values of each element in `v` with `low` equals `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:Let's analyze the provided annotated code step-by-step to determine the functionality of the function `func`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - The function takes two inputs: `n` and `s` (both integers).
   - Constraints: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\) and \(1 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\).
   - There is also a list of `n` integers `v`, where each `v_i` (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9).

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `v` is sorted in ascending order using `v.sort()`.

3. **Binary Search for Minimum Total Volume:**
   - The function uses a binary search approach to find the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` is at least `s`.
   - The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `min(v)` respectively.
   - The binary search continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`.

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Inside the loop, `mid` is calculated as \(\text{low} + \frac{\text{high} - \text{low} + 1}{2}\).
   - The total volume `total` is computed as the sum of `min(mid, x)` for each element `x` in `v`.
   - If `total` is less than `s`, `low` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

5. **Post-Loop Conditions:**
   - After the loop, the function checks if the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` equals `s`.
   - If the sum is not equal to `s`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `low`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Edge Case:** If `v` contains only one element, the binary search might not work as expected. However, since `v` is sorted, this edge case is handled by the binary search logic.
- **Edge Case:** If `low` reaches the maximum possible value and the condition is still not met, the loop will exit with `low` being the best possible solution.

### Summary of Functionality:

The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `s`, along with a list of `n` integers `v`. It sorts the list `v` and performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` is at least `s`. If such a `low` is found and the sum equals `s`, it prints `low`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

**Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `s`, along with a list of `n` integers `v`, sorts the list, and finds the smallest integer `low` such that the sum of the minimum values between `low` and each element in `v` is at least `s`. If the sum equals `s`, it prints `low`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
