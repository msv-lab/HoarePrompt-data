The code `n, s = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `s` respectively. This means that `n` and `s` now hold the specific integer values entered by the user, while the list `v` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer entered by the user, `s` is the second integer entered by the user, and `v` is a list of n integers where each v_i (1 â‰¤ v_i â‰¤ 10^9) represents the volume of the i-th keg.**
