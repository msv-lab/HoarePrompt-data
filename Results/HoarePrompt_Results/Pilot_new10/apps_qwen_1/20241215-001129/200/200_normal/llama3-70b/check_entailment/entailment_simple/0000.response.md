Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Initial Setup and Variable Assignment**: 
   - The program correctly reads the inputs and sorts the keg volumes.
   - However, the initial setup of `low` and `high` is incorrect. `low` should be set to 0, but `high` should be set to the maximum possible value of `s` divided by `n`, rather than the minimum value in the list `v`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is implemented to find the maximum amount of kvass that can be poured into the least full keg such that the total amount is at least `s`.
   - However, the condition in the binary search (`if total < s:`) is incorrect. It should check if the current mid-value can satisfy the requirement without ensuring that the minimum amount in any keg is maximized.

3. **Calculation of Total**:
   - The calculation of `total` is almost correct, but the way `low` is updated after the loop is problematic. The program should ensure that `low` is the maximum value that can achieve the required `s`.

4. **Final Check and Output**:
   - The final check to determine if the solution is valid (`if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s):`) is flawed. This check does not correctly determine if the optimal solution has been found.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program that adheres to the problem description:

```python
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()

    low, high = 0, s // n + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)

        if total < s:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid

    if sum(min(low, x) for x in v) < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `low` is set to 0.
   - `high` is set to `s // n + 1`, which is the maximum possible value that can be poured into each keg to meet the requirement.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search iteratively narrows down the range of possible values for the minimum amount of kvass in the least full keg.
   - `total` calculates the total amount of kvass that can be poured if each keg is filled to `mid` liters.
   - If `total` is less than `s`, it means we need a higher `mid`, so we update `low`.
   - Otherwise, we update `high` to `mid`.

3. **Final Check and Output**:
   - After the loop, we check if the calculated `low` can actually achieve the required `s` by checking the total amount of kvass.
   - If not, we print `-1`. Otherwise, we print the value of `low`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly finds the maximum amount of kvass that can be poured into the least full keg while meeting the requirement of having at least `s` liters in total.
