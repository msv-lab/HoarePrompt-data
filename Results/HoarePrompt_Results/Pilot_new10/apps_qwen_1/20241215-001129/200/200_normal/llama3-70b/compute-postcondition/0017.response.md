Postcondition: **`total` is `v[0] + v[1]` if both elements in `v` are less than or equal to `mid`, otherwise it is `v[0] + min(v[1], mid)`, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `s` is the second integer entered by the user, `v` is a list of two integers sorted in ascending order, `low` is `mid`, `high` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is `((low + high + 1) // 2)`, if `total < s`, then the condition `total < s` holds true, otherwise the condition `total >= s` holds true.**
