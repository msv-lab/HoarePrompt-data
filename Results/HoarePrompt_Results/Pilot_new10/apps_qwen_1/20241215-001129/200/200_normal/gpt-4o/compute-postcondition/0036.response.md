Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is decreased by \(\left(\frac{remaining\_kvass + n - 1}{n}\right)\); `i` is the index of the first volume in `volumes` that is greater than `min_keg_volume`, or `n` if no such volume exists; `remaining_kvass` is either 0 (if all required kvass has been taken) or reduced according to the specified formula if kvass still needs to be taken.***
