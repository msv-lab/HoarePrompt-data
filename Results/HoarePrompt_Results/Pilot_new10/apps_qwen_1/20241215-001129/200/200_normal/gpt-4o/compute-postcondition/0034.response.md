Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list and is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is the first element in the `volumes` list; `i` is the index of the first volume in `volumes` that is greater than `min_keg_volume`, or `n` if no such volume exists; `remaining_kvass` is currently greater than 0 if there is still kvass needed, or 0 if all the required kvass has been taken.**
