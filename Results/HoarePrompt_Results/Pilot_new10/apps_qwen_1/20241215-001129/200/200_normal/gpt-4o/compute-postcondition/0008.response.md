`remaining_kvass` is assigned the value of `s`. The value of `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \le n \le 10^3\), `s` is an integer such that \(1 \le s \le 10^{12}\), `volumes` is a list of integers such that \(1 \le v_i \le 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range \(1 \le i \le n\) and `volumes` is sorted in ascending order; `total_volume` is the sum of the elements in the `volumes` list; `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`; `min_keg_volume` is the first element in the `volumes` list; `remaining_kvass` is `s`.**
