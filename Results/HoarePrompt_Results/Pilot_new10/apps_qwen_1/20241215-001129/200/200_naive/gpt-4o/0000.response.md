Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total volume of kvass is less than `s` but does not provide the correct minimum volume in the least keg. According to the problem description, if the total volume of kvass is less than `s`, the output should be `-1`. However, the program checks this condition but does not handle it correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 7
1 2 3
```
In this case, the total volume of kvass is `6`, which is less than `7`. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`. However, the program will attempt to distribute the `7` liters of kvass among the kegs and will output a value instead of `-1`.

To fix this, the program needs to check the total volume before attempting to distribute the kvass and print `-1` if the total volume is less than `s`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    volumes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    volumes.sort()
    total_volume = sum(volumes)
    if total_volume < s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        min_keg_volume = volumes[0]
        remaining_kvass = s
        for i in range(n):
            if volumes[i] <= min_keg_volume:
                continue
            else:
                possible_to_take = min(volumes[i] - min_keg_volume, remaining_kvass)
                remaining_kvass -= possible_to_take
            if remaining_kvass == 0:
                break
        if remaining_kvass > 0:
            min_keg_volume -= (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n
        print(min_keg_volume)
```

This ensures that the program handles the case where the total volume is insufficient correctly.
