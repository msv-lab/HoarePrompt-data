Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to pour exactly `s` liters of kvass such that the least keg has as much kvass as possible. Specifically, the binary search approach used in the program does not ensure that the solution is valid for all possible values of `s`.

Consider the following case:

Input:
```
3 7
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

However, the program will output `1` because it does not check if the total amount of kvass is sufficient to meet the requirement of `s` liters. In this case, the total amount of kvass is `6`, which is less than `7`, but the program does not handle this edge case correctly.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the total amount of kvass is at least `s` before attempting to distribute it among the kegs. Here is an updated version of the program that addresses this issue:

```python
def func():
    (n, s) = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    total_kvass = sum(v)
    if total_kvass < s:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    (low, high) = (0, min(v))
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    if sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(low)

func()
```

This updated version first checks if the total amount of kvass is sufficient. If not, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it proceeds with the binary search to find the maximum possible kvass in the least keg.
