The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return based on certain conditions involving integers N, M, K, and L, where 1 <= K <= N <= 10^18, 1 <= M, L <= 10^18, and M * L >= K. However, since no specific output conditions are provided beyond the parameter constraints, the function's behavior based on the given information is not fully defined.
