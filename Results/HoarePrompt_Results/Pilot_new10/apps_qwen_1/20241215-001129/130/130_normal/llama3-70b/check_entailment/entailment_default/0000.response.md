Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code checks if `M` is greater than or equal to both `N - K + 1` and `L`. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that the terms are met. 

To satisfy all the conditions:
1. Each friend must gift as many coins as others.
2. All coins given to Ivan must be different.
3. At least `L` coins from the gifts must be new in Ivan's collection.

The condition `M >= N - K + 1` ensures that there are enough different coins available to give to Ivan, but it does not guarantee that at least `L` of those coins will be new. Additionally, the condition `M >= L` does not ensure that the coins gifted are distinct and not already in Ivan's collection.

For example, consider the following input:
```
20 15 10 8
```
Here, `N = 20`, `M = 15`, `K = 10`, and `L = 8`. According to the conditions, Ivan needs at least 8 new coins, and there are 15 friends, so it seems feasible. However, the code will output `1` because `15 >= 10 - 10 + 1` and `15 >= 8`. But this does not ensure that 8 new coins are actually gifted.

A more robust solution would involve ensuring that each friend gifts a unique set of coins that includes at least `L` new coins not in Ivan's collection. The current implementation does not account for this requirement, hence it is incorrect.
