Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Minimum Coins:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all conditions. However, the program checks if `M` (the number of friends) is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and `M` is greater than or equal to `L`. This logic is insufficient to determine the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift.
   
2. **Condition for Minimum Number of Coins:**
   - For the condition `M * L >= K` to be satisfied and for each friend to gift different coins, the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift is `max((K - L + 1) // M, 1)` if `M * L >= K`. If this condition is not met, the output should be `-1`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `M * L < K`, it should output `-1`, but the current logic does not account for this scenario.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    min_coins_per_friend = max((K - L + 1) // M, 1)
    if M * L >= K:
        if min_coins_per_friend * M == K - L + 1:
            print(min_coins_per_friend)
        else:
            print(-1)
    else:
        print(-1)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Calculating Minimum Coins per Friend:** 
  - `(K - L + 1) // M` calculates how many coins each friend needs to gift to ensure at least `K - L + 1` new coins are added.
  - `max((K - L + 1) // M, 1)` ensures that each friend gives at least 1 coin.

- **Checking Conditions:**
  - `if M * L >= K:` checks if the total number of coins gifted by all friends is sufficient.
  - If the condition is met, it further checks if the minimum number of coins per friend multiplied by `M` equals `K - L + 1` (which ensures exactly `K - L + 1` new coins). If not, it prints `-1`.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - If `M * L < K`, it directly prints `-1` because the condition cannot be met.

This corrected program ensures that all conditions are met as specified in the problem description.
