Let's break down the annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function:

1. The function `func` is defined without accepting any parameters.
2. The function reads four integers `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` from the input, which are mapped using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. The condition inside the if-else block checks if `M` is greater than or equal to `N - K + 1` and also greater than or equal to `L`.
4. If both conditions are true, the function prints `1`.
5. If either condition is false, the function prints `-1`.

Now, let's consider the edge cases and ensure we cover all potential scenarios:

- If `M < N - K + 1` and `M < L`, the function will print `-1`.
- If `M >= N - K + 1` but `M < L`, the function will print `-1`.
- If `M >= L` but `M < N - K + 1`, the function will print `-1`.

From the above, we can summarize the functionality of the function:

Functionality: **The function reads four integers `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` from the input and prints `1` if `M` is greater than or equal to both `N - K + 1` and `L`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.**
