Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program checks only two conditions (`M >= N - K + 1` and `M >= L`) to determine whether to print `1` or `-1`. However, the problem requires ensuring that all friends gift different coins, and not just checking these two conditions.

Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Condition Check**: The program correctly checks if `M >= N - K + 1` and `M >= L`. These conditions ensure that:
   - `M >= N - K + 1`: There are enough unique coins to distribute among the friends such that each friend can give at least one unique coin.
   - `M >= L`: At least `L` coins must be new in Ivan's collection.

2. **Missing Condition**: The program does not check whether the total number of different coins (`N`) is sufficient for distributing unique coins to each friend. For example, if `N < M * (N - K + 1) / M`, it means that there are not enough different coins available for each friend to give a unique coin. The program fails to handle this scenario properly.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the first example (`20 15 2 3`), the program correctly prints `1` because `M (15) >= N - K + 1 (20 - 2 + 1 = 19)` and `M (15) >= L (3)`.
   - In the second example (`10 11 2 4`), the program incorrectly prints `1` when it should print `-1` because even though `M (11) >= L (4)`, there are only `10` different coins available, making it impossible for each friend to gift a unique coin.

To fix the program, the following additional condition needs to be checked:
- Ensure that `N >= M * (N - K + 1) / M` to guarantee that there are enough different coins for each friend to give a unique coin.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N, M, K, L = map(int, input().split())
    if (M >= N - K + 1 and M >= L and N >= M * (N - K + 1) // M):
        print(1)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program checks the necessary condition to guarantee that there are enough unique coins for each friend to give a unique coin.
