Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where \(K\) exceeds \(N\). According to the problem description, \(1 \le K \le N\), but the code does not check this condition. As a result, if \(K > N\), the function will still attempt to calculate and print \(-1\), which is incorrect because it is impossible to have more coins in the collection than the total number of different coins available.

To fix this, you need to add a condition to check if \(K > N\). Here is the corrected version:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Check if K exceeds N
    if K > N:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)

func()
```

This ensures that the function correctly handles the case where \(K > N\), preventing incorrect outputs.
