You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ivan is collecting coins. There are only $N$ different collectible coins, Ivan has $K$ of them. He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $M$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $L$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection.


-----Output-----

Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
20 15 2 3

Output
1
Input
10 11 2 4

Output
-1


-----Note-----

In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new.

In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (N, M, K, L) = map(int, input().split())
    min_x = (L + M - 1) // M
    if M * min_x <= N - K:
        print(min_x)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins one friend needs to gift to satisfy all the given conditions. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\).

2. **Calculating Minimum Coins per Friend**: It calculates the minimum number of coins (\(min\_x\)) one friend needs to gift using the formula \((L + M - 1) // M\). This ensures that the total number of unique coins gifted is at least \(L\) more than the number of friends \(M\).

3. **Checking Feasibility**: It checks if the product of \(M\) and \(min\_x\) is less than or equal to the difference between the total number of different coins \(N\) and the number of coins Ivan already has \(K\). If this condition is satisfied, it prints \(min\_x\). Otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

This logic correctly handles the constraints and conditions provided in the problem description. Given the problem's requirements and the examples provided, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\) from standard input, where \(1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}\), \(1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}\), and \(M \times (\text{minimum number of coins one friend can gift}) \ge L\). It calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift, denoted as `min_x`, using the formula \((L + M - 1) // M\). If \(M \times min_x \le N - K\), it prints `min_x`; otherwise, it prints \(-1\). If \(K\) exceeds \(N\), the function will still execute the calculation and print \(-1\). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
