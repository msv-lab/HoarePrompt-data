Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not handle the case where \(N\) (the total number of different coins) is smaller than \(K + L\). According to the problem description, it is impossible to satisfy the condition that at least \(L\) coins must be new in Ivan's collection if \(N < K + L\). The output hint also confirms that the function will still execute the calculation and print \(-1\) even if \(K\) exceeds \(N\), which is incorrect. This leads to incorrect outputs for certain inputs, such as the example provided:

Input:
```
10 11 2 4
```

The correct output should be \(-1\), but the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program needs to be fixed to handle this edge case.
