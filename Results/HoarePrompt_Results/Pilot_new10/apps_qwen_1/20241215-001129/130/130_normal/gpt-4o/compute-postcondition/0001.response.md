The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. Since the actual input values are not provided, we will keep the variables as they are in the input state, but note that they are now assigned specific values from the input.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers assigned values from input, such that $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$, $1 \le M, L \le 10^{18}$, and $M \times (\text{minimum number of coins one friend can gift}) \ge L$.**
