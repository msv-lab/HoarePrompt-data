Postcondition: ***`d` is `T * (c1 - c2)`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`. If `d` is less than 0, the value of `d` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition retains the same values as the precondition.***
