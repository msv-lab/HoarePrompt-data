Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program attempts to solve the problem, but there are several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_2` is aimed at finding the minimum time required to have at least `K` pieces of meat ready. However, the condition used in the binary search (`func_1(meats, K, mid)`) is flawed. Specifically, `func_1` checks if all pieces of meat are ready by a certain time `T`, but it does not ensure that exactly `K` pieces are ready.
   - The binary search should find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready, not all `N` pieces.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to check if all pieces of meat are ready by a given time `T`. It uses a complex geometric calculation to find the optimal point to place the heat source. However, this function does not correctly handle the condition that only `K` pieces need to be ready.
   - The function should instead focus on finding the minimum `T` such that at least `K` pieces are ready, not all pieces.

3. **No Guarantee of Finding the Optimal Solution**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the solution found is the optimal one. The binary search approach is only valid if it correctly identifies the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces are ready, but due to the flaws in `func_1`, it may fail to converge to the correct solution.

4. **Incorrect Return Type**:
   - The program returns `high` as the result, which is the upper bound of the binary search interval. However, this is not necessarily the minimum time required to have at least `K` pieces ready. The program should return the exact minimum time `T`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Use a binary search to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
2. Ensure that `func_1` correctly checks if at least `K` pieces of meat are ready by time `T`.
3. Handle the geometric calculations and the search for the optimal point to place the heat source correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and hence is incorrect.
