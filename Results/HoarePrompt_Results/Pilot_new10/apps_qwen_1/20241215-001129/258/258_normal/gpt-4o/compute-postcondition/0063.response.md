Postcondition: ***`c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i+2]`, `d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\), `dx` is the same, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `cx` is the same, `cy` is the same, `my` is the same, `count` is the same, and `j` is `i + 2`. If `d * d2 > d2`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no change in the values of the variables.***
