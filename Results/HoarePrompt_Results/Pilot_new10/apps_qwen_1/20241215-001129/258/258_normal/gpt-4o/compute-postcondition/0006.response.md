The code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `x`. Given that `index` is 2, `x` will be the integer value of the third element in the list `data`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the original input split by spaces, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, and 1 <= N <= 60, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, and 1 <= K <= N, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of the third element in `data`**
