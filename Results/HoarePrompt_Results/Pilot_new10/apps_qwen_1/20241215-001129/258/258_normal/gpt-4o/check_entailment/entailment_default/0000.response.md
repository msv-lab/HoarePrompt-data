Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description. The primary issue lies in the way the function `func_1` is designed. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to check if a certain time `T` allows at least `K` pieces of meat to be ready, but it does not actually compute the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. Instead, it performs a series of checks to determine if a given `T` value is sufficient, which is not the correct approach.

To find the minimum time required, the function should perform a binary search similar to `func_2`, but it should directly compute the time required for each candidate `T` and check if it is sufficient to have at least `K` pieces of meat ready. The current implementation of `func_1` is not suitable for finding the minimum time, as it only checks if a given `T` is sufficient without minimizing the time.

Here is a brief outline of what the correct approach should look like:

1. Perform a binary search to find the minimum time `T`.
2. For each candidate `T`, calculate the number of pieces of meat that can be ready within time `T`.
3. Return the minimum `T` that satisfies the condition.

The current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not correctly achieve this, hence the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
