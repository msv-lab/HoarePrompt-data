`meats[i]` is unpacked into `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. The value of `i` remains `i_end + 1`, `N` is still greater than `i_end + 2`, and `count` is still incremented and less than `K`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are taken from the tuple `meats[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is incremented and less than `K`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, and `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`**
