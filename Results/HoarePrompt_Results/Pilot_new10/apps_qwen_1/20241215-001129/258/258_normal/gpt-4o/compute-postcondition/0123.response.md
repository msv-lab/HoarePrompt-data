The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the execution of the `continue` statement does not change any variables. All the variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`x1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `j` remains unchanged, `dx` remains unchanged, `dy` remains unchanged, `cx` remains unchanged, `cy` remains unchanged, `d2` remains unchanged, `mx` remains unchanged, `my` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged.**
