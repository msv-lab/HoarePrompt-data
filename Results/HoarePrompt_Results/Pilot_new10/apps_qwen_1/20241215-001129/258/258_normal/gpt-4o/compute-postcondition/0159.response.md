The code updates the value of `mx` based on the formula `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. Let's break down the calculation:

1. `d2` is defined as `dx * dx + dy * dy`.
2. The formula inside the square root simplifies to `d2 * d - d * d = d2 * d - d2 = d2 * (d - 1)`.
3. Therefore, `mx` becomes `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * (d - 1)) / d2`.

Since `math.sqrt(d2 * (d - 1)) / d2` is a part of the expression and does not depend on the exact values of `cx` and `dy`, we can simplify the output state without needing the specific values of `cx` and `dy`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `c1` is updated to either its original value or `c2` depending on the condition, `c2` is updated to either its original value or `c1` depending on the condition, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * (d - 1)) / d2`, and the loop continues.**
