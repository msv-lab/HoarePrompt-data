`cx` is assigned the value of `(x1 + x2) / 2`. This updates the value of `cx` based on the current values of `x1` and `x2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `j` remains unchanged, `dx` remains unchanged, `dy` remains unchanged, `cx` is updated to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` remains unchanged, `d2` remains unchanged, `mx` remains unchanged, `my` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged.**
