`index` is incremented by 3. Initially, `index` is 2, so after incrementing, `index` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is `[ (x, y, c) ]`, `index` is 5, `x` is the integer value of the third element in `data`, `y` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`, `c` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is `[ (x, y, c) ]`, `index` is 5, `x` is the integer value of the third element in `data`, `y` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`, `c` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.**
