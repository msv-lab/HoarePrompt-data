Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 2`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is updated based on the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)`, `d` remains `c1 * T - c2 * T` if `d < 0`, otherwise `d` remains `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `c1` remains the original value of `c2`, `x1` remains the original value of `x2`, `y1` remains the original value of `y2`, `c2` remains the original value of `c1`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1 - x2)`, and the condition `d * d2 > d2` is evaluated, if true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If false, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
