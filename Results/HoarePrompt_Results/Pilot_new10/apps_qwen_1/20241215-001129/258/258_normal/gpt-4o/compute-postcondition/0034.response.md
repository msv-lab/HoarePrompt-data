Postcondition: ***`dx` is \((x2 - x1) / 2\) if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remains its original value otherwise; `c1` and `c2` are swapped if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remain their original values otherwise; `d` is set to `c1 * T - c2 * T` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remains its original value otherwise; `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, `count`, and `j` are unchanged.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we consider only the if part. The if statement does not change the preconditions for `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, `count`, and `j`. The values of `dx` and `c1`/`c2`/`d` are updated according to the condition `d < 0`. Therefore, the postcondition is the same as the precondition for those variables that are not changed, and the updated values for `dx`, `c1`, `c2`, and `d` based on the condition.
