The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, it only affects the flow of the loop. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i+2]`, `d` is \((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)\), `dx` is the same, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `cx` is the same, `cy` is the same, `my` is the same, `count` is the same, and `j` is `i + 2` and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
