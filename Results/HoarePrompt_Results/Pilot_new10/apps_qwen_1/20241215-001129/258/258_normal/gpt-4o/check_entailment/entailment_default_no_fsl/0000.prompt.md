You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of a piece of meat, and two integers `K` and `T`. It iterates through all pairs of meat pieces, calculates the midpoint and distance between them, and counts the number of other meat pieces within a distance `T` from this midpoint. If at any point the count of such pieces is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`. If no such pair of meat pieces satisfy this condition, the function returns `False`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    (low, high) = (0, 1000000000.0)
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return high
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. It performs a binary search to find the value of `high` such that the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to \(1 \times 10^{-7}\). During the search, it uses the function `func_1` to determine whether a certain condition is met. If `func_1` returns `True`, `high` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`. The function ultimately returns the final value of `high` after the loop terminates.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        index += 3
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a string `data` containing space-separated integers representing the values of `N`, `K`, followed by the coordinates and hardness of `N` pieces of meat. It processes this input to extract the necessary data into variables `N`, `K`, and a list of meat tuples `(x, y, c)`. It then calls `func_2` with `N`, `K`, and the list of meat tuples as arguments. Finally, it prints the result from `func_2` formatted to six decimal places.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
