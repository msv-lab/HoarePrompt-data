The code `continue` is used to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables. The states of the variables `dx`, `c1`, `c2`, `d`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, `count`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx` is \((x2 - x1) / 2` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remains its original value otherwise; `c1` and `c2` are swapped if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remain their original values otherwise; `d` is set to `c1 * T - c2 * T` if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remains its original value otherwise; `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dy`, `d2`, `my`, `count`, and `j` are unchanged.**
