The code `x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]` assigns the values from the tuple `meats[i]` to the variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. Since the values of `meats[i]` are not specified in the initial state, we will represent them as generic values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `c2`, `d`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `x2`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `y2`, `cx`, `cy`, `my`, `count` are as defined initially, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` must be less than `K`**
