The initial value of `d` is `T * (c1 - c2)`. The code snippet divides `d` by `c1 * c2`. After this operation, the value of `d` becomes `T * (c1 - c2) / (c1 * c2)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is `T * (c1 - c2) / (c1 * c2)`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`**
