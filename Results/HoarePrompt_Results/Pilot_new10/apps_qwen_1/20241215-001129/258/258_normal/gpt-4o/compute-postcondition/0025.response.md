The code `print(f'{result:.6f}')` prints the value of `result` formatted to 6 decimal places. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`. Since the function `func_2` is not defined, the exact value of `result` cannot be determined, but we know that it is the return value of this function. The other variables (`data`, `N`, `K`, `meats`, `index`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is a list of tuples containing (x, y, c) where the original values of x, y, and c are derived from the elements in data starting from the third element and incrementing by 3 for each tuple, `index` is 3 * N + 2, `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`**
