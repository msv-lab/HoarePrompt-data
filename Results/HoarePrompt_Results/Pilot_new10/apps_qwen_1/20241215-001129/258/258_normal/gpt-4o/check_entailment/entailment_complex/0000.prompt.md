You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

Otherwise, the function does not return anything and leaves the variables unchanged.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of a piece of meat, and two integers `K` and `T`. It iterates through all pairs of meat pieces, calculates the midpoint and distance between them, and counts the number of other meat pieces within a distance `T` from this midpoint. If at any point the count of such pieces is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`. If no such pair of meat pieces satisfy this condition, the function returns `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 60, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N, meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i, y_i\) and hardness \(c_i\) of the i-th piece of meat, and all coordinates satisfy -1000 ≤ \(x_i, y_i\) ≤ 1000, with no two pieces of meat having the same coordinates.

If `func_1(meats, K, mid)` evaluates to false, then `low` is the final value of `low`.
    return high
    #`The program returns the value of high which is the final value such that the difference between high and low is less than or equal to 1e-07`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. It performs a binary search to find the value of `high` such that the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to \(1 \times 10^{-7}\). During the search, it uses the function `func_1` to determine whether a certain condition is met. If `func_1` returns `True`, `high` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`. The function ultimately returns the final value of `high` after the loop terminates.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: data is a string containing space-separated integers representing the values of N, K, followed by the coordinates and hardness of N pieces of meat. N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 60 and 1 <= K <= N. Each piece of meat is represented by three integers (x, y, c) where -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100. All (x, y) pairs are unique.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `data` is a list of strings, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is a list of tuples containing `N` elements, each tuple is `(x, y, c)` where `x`, `y`, and `c` are integers, `index` is `3 * N + 2`, the original values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are the integers corresponding to the elements in `data` starting from `data[2]` and incrementing by 3 for each tuple.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a string `data` containing space-separated integers representing the values of `N`, `K`, followed by the coordinates and hardness of `N` pieces of meat. It processes this input to extract the necessary data into variables `N`, `K`, and a list of meat tuples `(x, y, c)`. It then calls `func_2` with `N`, `K`, and the list of meat tuples as arguments. Finally, it prints the result from `func_2` formatted to six decimal places.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
