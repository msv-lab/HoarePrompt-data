According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i + 1` is less than `N`. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that this condition is met.

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will run as long as `i + 1 < N`.
2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `j` will be set to `i + 1` at the start of each iteration, but we need to ensure that the loop can start, which means the initial condition `i + 1 < N` must be true.
3. **Adjusting States**: We need to adjust the state such that the initial condition for the loop to start is satisfied. This means `i` must be less than `N - 1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is less than `N - 1`**
