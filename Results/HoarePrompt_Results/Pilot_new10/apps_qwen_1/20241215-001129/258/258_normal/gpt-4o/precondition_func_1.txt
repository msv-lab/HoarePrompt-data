N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 60, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ N, meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates \(x_i, y_i\) and hardness \(c_i\) of the i-th piece of meat, and all coordinates satisfy -1000 ≤ \(x_i, y_i\) ≤ 1000, with no two pieces of meat having the same coordinates.
