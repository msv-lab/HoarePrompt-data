The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Based on the given initial state and the code snippet, the following variables are updated:

- `dy` is updated to `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `cx` is updated to `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is updated to `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `d2` is updated to `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- `dx` is updated to `(x1 - x2) / 2`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `j` remains unchanged, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx` remains unchanged, `my` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`**
