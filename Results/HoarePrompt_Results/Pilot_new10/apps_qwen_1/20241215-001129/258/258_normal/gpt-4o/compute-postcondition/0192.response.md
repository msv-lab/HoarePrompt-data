The `continue` statement in the code does not modify any variable values or perform any calculations. It simply moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop (if the code was inside one). Given that no variables are modified by this statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is updated based on the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `c1` remains the original value of `c2`, `x1` remains the original value of `x2`, `y1` remains the original value of `y2`, and `c2` remains the original value of `c1`.**
