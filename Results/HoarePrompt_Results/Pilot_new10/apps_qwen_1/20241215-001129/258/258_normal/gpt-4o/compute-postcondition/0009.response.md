The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the list `meats`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `c` are taken from the third and fourth elements of the list `data`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `data` is a list of strings.
- `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
- `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`.
- `meats` is an empty list before the append operation.
- `index` is 2.
- `x` is the integer value of the third element in `data`.
- `y` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.
- `c` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.

After the append operation, the list `meats` will contain one additional tuple, which is `(x, y, c)`. The other variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is `[ (x, y, c) ]`, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of the third element in `data`, `y` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`, `c` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.**
