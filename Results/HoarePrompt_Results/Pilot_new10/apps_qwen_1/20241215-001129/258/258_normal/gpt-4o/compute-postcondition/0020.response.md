The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to `c`. Given that `index` is 10, `data[index + 2]` corresponds to `data[12]`, which is the integer value of the thirteenth element in `data`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `meats` is `[(x, y, c), (x, y, c)]`, `index` is 10, `x` is the integer value of `data[10]`, `y` is the integer value of `data[11]`, `c` is the integer value of the thirteenth element in `data`**
