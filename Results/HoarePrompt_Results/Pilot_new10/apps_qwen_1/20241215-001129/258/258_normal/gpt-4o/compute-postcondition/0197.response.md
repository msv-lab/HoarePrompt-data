`dx` is assigned the value of `(x1 - x2) / 2`. This calculation is based on the current values of `x1` and `x2`. Since no specific values for `x1` and `x2` are given, we will keep them as they are, but note that `dx` now holds the calculated value.

The states of other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is updated based on the condition `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T` if `d < 0`, otherwise `d` remains `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `c1` remains the original value of `c2`, `x1` remains the original value of `x2`, `y1` remains the original value of `y2`, `c2` remains the original value of `c1`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.**
