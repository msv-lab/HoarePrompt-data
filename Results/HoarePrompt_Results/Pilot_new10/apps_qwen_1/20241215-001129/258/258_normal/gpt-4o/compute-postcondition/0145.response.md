Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i_end + 1]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `c1` and `c2` swap values. No other changes occur.***
