Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j < N`.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`
   - `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`
   - `c1` and `c2` are updated based on some condition.
   - `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`
   - `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
   - `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
   - `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
   - `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
   - `d2` is `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`
   - `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * (d - 1)) / d2`
   - `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`
   - `count` is less than `K`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i_end + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` will be `i_end + 2`.

4. **Update the States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as `i_end + 1`.
   - `N` remains unchanged.
   - `c1` and `c2` will be updated again in the next iteration but their values are not explicitly required for the loop condition.
   - `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` will be recalculated in the next iteration, but their values are not necessary for the loop condition.
   - `count` will be incremented and checked against `K`.

5. **Loop Condition After Update**:
   - The loop will run if `j < N`.
   - Since `j` is now `i_end + 2`, the loop will execute if `i_end + 2 < N`.

Given these steps, we can summarize the updated states as follows:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `c1` and `c2` are updated, `d` is recalculated, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my` are recalculated, `count` is incremented and less than `K`**

However, to clearly state what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the loop condition:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is incremented and less than `K`**

Thus, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is incremented and less than `K`**
