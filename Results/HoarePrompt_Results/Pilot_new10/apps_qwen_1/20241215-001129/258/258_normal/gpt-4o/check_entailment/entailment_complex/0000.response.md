Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

To verify the correctness of the provided code, let's analyze it against the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Find the time required to have \( K \) or more pieces of meat ready if a heat source is placed to minimize this time.
2. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \leq N \leq 60 \)
   - \( 1 \leq K \leq N \)
   - \( -1000 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 1000 \)
   - \( \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \) for \( i \neq j \)
   - \( 1 \leq c_i \leq 100 \)

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read as a single line of space-separated integers, split into `N`, `K`, and the coordinates and hardness of `N` pieces of meat.
   - This matches the problem description.

2. **Binary Search (`func_2`)**:
   - The function performs a binary search over the possible time intervals `[0, 1000000000.0]` to find the minimum time `T` such that at least `K` pieces of meat are ready.
   - It uses `func_1` to check if a given `T` allows `K` or more pieces of meat to be ready.
   - This approach ensures that the solution is accurate within the required precision (within \(1 \times 10^{-7}\)).

3. **Midpoint and Distance Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function iterates through all pairs of meat pieces to calculate the midpoint and distance between them.
   - It checks if placing the heat source at this midpoint allows the required number of pieces to be ready within the given time.
   - This method considers all possible midpoints between pairs of meat pieces, ensuring no piece is missed.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the constraints on the number of meat pieces (`N`), the number of pieces needed (`K`), and the coordinate ranges.
   - The binary search approach ensures that even with a large number of pieces (up to 60), the solution remains feasible and accurate.

Given the above analysis, the code correctly implements the problem requirements and handles all constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
