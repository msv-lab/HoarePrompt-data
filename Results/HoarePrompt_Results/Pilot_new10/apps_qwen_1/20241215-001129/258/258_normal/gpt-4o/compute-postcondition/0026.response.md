The function `func_3` accepts a single parameter `data`, which is a string containing space-separated integers. The string represents the values of N and K, followed by the coordinates and hardness of N pieces of meat. N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 60 and 1 <= K <= N. Each piece of meat is represented by three integers (x, y, c) where -1000 <= x, y <= 1000 and 1 <= c <= 100. All (x, y) pairs are unique.

After processing the input string, the function does not return anything specified in the given information. Therefore, the return value is implied to be unspecified or potentially a side effect like modifying some state or performing some action.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `data`, which is a string containing space-separated integers representing the values of N, K, followed by the coordinates and hardness of N pieces of meat. The function processes this input but does not explicitly return a value.**
