`dx` is assigned the value `(x1 - x2) / 2`. This updates the value of `dx` based on the values of `x1` and `x2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is `T * (c1 - c2) / (c1 * c2)`, `i` is less than `N - 1`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`, `cx` is (x1 + x2) / 2, `cy` is (y1 + y2) / 2, `dx` is (x1 - x2) / 2**
