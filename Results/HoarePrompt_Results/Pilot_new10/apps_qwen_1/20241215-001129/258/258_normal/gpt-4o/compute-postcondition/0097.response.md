The code snippet updates the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` to be the first, second, and third elements of `meats[i]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `x1` is updated to the first element of `meats[i]`.
- `y1` is updated to the second element of `meats[i]`.
- `c1` is updated to the third element of `meats[i]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`d` is \(T \cdot (c1 - c2) / (c1 \cdot c2)\), `i` is less than `N - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the fourth element of `meats[j]`, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\), `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\), `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\), `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\), `mx` is \(cx + dy \cdot \sqrt(d2 \cdot d - d \cdot d) / d2\), `my` is \(\frac{y1 + y2}{2} - \frac{(x1 - x2)/2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4} \cdot d - d^2}}{\frac{(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2}{4}}\), `count` is the number of elements in `meats` for which the Euclidean distance from `(x, y)` to `(mx, my)` is greater than `K`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`.**
