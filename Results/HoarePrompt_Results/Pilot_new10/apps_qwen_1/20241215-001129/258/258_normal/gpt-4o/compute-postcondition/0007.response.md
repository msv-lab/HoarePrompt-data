The code `y = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` converted to an integer to the variable `y`. Given the initial state:

- `data` is a list of strings containing the original input split by spaces.
- `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
- `1 <= N <= 60`.
- `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`.
- `1 <= K <= N`.
- `meats` is an empty list.
- `index` is 2.
- `x` is the integer value of the third element in `data`.

Since `index` is 2, `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[3]`, which is the fourth element in the list `data`. This element is converted to an integer and assigned to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the original input split by spaces, `N` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `1 <= N <= 60`, `K` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `1 <= K <= N`, `meats` is an empty list, `index` is 2, `x` is the integer value of the third element in `data`, `y` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`.**
