`cy` is assigned the value of \((y1 + y2) / 2\). This calculation does not affect the values of the other variables. The values of `i`, `N`, `count`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, and `cx` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is incremented and less than `K`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `d` is \(\frac{T}{c2} - \frac{T}{c1}\), `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\), `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\)**
