Postcondition: ***`x1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `j` remains unchanged, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx` remains unchanged, `my` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`. If `d * d2 > d2`, then `dy` is updated to `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `cx` is updated to `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is updated to `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `d2` is updated to `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, and `dx` is updated to `(x1 - x2) / 2`. Otherwise, the variables remain as they were after the updates in the if part.***
