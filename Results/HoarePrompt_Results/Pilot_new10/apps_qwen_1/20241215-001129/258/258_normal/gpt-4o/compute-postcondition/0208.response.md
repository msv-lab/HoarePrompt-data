Output State: **`i` is `N`, `j` is `N - 1`, `dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\) where `x1` is the first element of `meats[j]` and `x2` is the first element of `meats[0]` when the loop last executed, `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\) where `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]` and `y2` is the second element of `meats[0]` when the loop last executed, `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\) where `x1` and `y1` are the first and second elements of `meats[j]` respectively, and `x2` and `y2` are the first and second elements of `meats[0]` respectively when the loop last executed, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]` when the loop last executed, `c2` is the third element of `meats[0]` when the loop last executed, `d` is \(\frac{(c1 \cdot T - c2 \cdot T)}{(c1 \cdot c2)}\) when the loop last executed, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\) where `x1` and `x2` are the first elements of `meats[j]` and `meats[0]` respectively, `cy` is the average of `y1` and `y2` when the loop last executed, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` when the loop last executed, `count` is the number of tuples in `meats` for which \(c * \mathsqrt{(mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2} \leq T\) is true when the loop last executed, `N` is the length of `meats`, `T` is a constant, `K` is a constant, and the function returns True if `count >= K` during any iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the function does not return anything and leaves the variables unchanged.**
