The code assigns the values from `meats[j]` to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. Specifically, `x2` gets the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` gets the second element, and `c2` gets the third element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`, and the values of `d`, `j`, `dx`, `dy`, `cx`, `cy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged.**
