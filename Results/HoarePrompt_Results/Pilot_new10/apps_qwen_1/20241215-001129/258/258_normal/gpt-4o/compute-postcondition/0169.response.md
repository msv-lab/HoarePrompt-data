Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 1`, `N` is greater than `i_end + 2`, `count` is incremented and less than `K`, `x1` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[i]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[j]`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is swapped with `x2`, `y1` is swapped with `y2`, and `c1` is swapped with `c2`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
