Output State: **`dx` is \((x1 - x2) / 2\); `dy` is \((y1 - y2) / 2\); `d2` is \(\left(\frac{x1 - x2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y1 - y2}{2}\right)^2\); `c1` and `c2` are swapped if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remain their original values otherwise; `d` is now \( d / (c1 \times c2) \) if `c1 * T < c2 * T` and remains its original value otherwise; `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `cx` is \((x1 + x2) / 2\); `cy` is \((y1 + y2) / 2\); `my` is updated to \( cy - dx * \sqrt{d2 * d - d * d} / d2 \); `count`, `j`, and `mx` are unchanged; `mx` is \( cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2 \)**
