Postcondition: ***`x1` is the first element of `meats[j]`, `y1` is the second element of `meats[j]`, `c1` is the third element of `meats[j]`, `x2` is the first element of `meats[i]`, `y2` is the second element of `meats[i]`, `c2` is the third element of `meats[i]`, and the values of `d`, `j`, `dx`, `dy`, `cx`, `cy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unchanged. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then the roles of `meats[i]` and `meats[j]` are swapped.***
