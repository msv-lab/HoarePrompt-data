The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `meats`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (x, y) and hardness (c) of a piece of meat, and two integers `K` and `T`. It iterates through all pairs of meat pieces, calculates the midpoint and distance between them, and counts the number of other meat pieces within a distance `T` from this midpoint. If at any point the count of such pieces is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`. If no such pair of meat pieces satisfy this condition, the function returns `False`.
