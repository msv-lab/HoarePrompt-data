The code initializes the variable `ans` with positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This sets the initial value of `ans` but does not affect the values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the value of `x` and `y` remains unchanged, and `ans` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `ans` is positive infinity**
