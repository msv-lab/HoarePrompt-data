Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000.
   - `y` is 1000.
   - `ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.
   - `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `x` in the range from -1000 to 1000 inclusive.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `x` needs to change to the next valid value within its range.
   - Since `x` was previously some value within the range `-1000 <= x <= 1000`, for the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop starts from -1000).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `y` remains constant at 1000.
   - `ans` and `times` are not directly affected by the loop itself but depend on the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` which is called for each `x`.
   - However, since we only need to consider the state for the next iteration of the loop, these variables can remain as they are unless they are modified inside the loop body, which is not specified here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `x` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `y` remains 1000.
- `ans` and `times` remain unchanged unless modified inside the loop body.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration, and `x` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
