`ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value (`times[2]` if it is less than positive infinity) and `times[K - 1]`. Since `K` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `times[K - 1]`. However, we know that `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers.

Given this, the value of `ans` will be the smaller of `times[2]` (if `times[2]` is less than positive infinity) and `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is the minimum of `times[2]` and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers.**
