The code updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `times[K - 1]`. Since `ans` is defined as the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged, the value of `ans` remains the same. All other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-1000`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged.**
