Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the coordinates of the meat pieces are real numbers, but the code only iterates over integer coordinates ranging from -1000 to 1000. This means that the code will miss any non-integer coordinates, even though the problem description allows for real numbers. For example, consider a scenario where the coordinates of a meat piece are (0.5, 0.5) and the hardness is 1. If the heat source is placed at (0.5, 0.5), the time to grill this piece would be 0.5 seconds. However, since the code only checks integer coordinates, this specific case would be missed, leading to an incorrect solution.

The annotations in the code also confirm that the code only checks integer coordinates, which further supports the conclusion that the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
