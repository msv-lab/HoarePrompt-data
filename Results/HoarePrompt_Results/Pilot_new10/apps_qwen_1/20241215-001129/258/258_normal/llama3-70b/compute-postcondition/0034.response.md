Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `x` is `initial_x + 1999`
- `y` is `-1000`
- `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`
- `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged.

### For Loop:
```
for y in range(-1000, 1001):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `y` from `-1000` to `1000` (inclusive).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `-1000`.

### Next Iteration:
- To move to the next iteration of the loop, `y` needs to be incremented by `1`.
- Therefore, `y` will become `-999`.

### Updated States:
- `x` remains unchanged: `initial_x + 1999`
- `y` changes to `-999`
- `times` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are determined by the function call `func_2` and the loop body, respectively.

### Final State:
State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-999`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -999, initial_x + 1999, -999)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged**.
