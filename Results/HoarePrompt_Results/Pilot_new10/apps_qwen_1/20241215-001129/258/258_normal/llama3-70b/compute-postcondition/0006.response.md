According to the code, the loop iterates over `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000 inclusive. The loop depends on the variable `y`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `ans` is `times[K - 1]` if `times[K - 1]` is less than positive infinity, and `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `y` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the range for `y` is from -1000 to 1000, the loop will continue as long as `y` is less than 1000. 

If the current value of `y` is 1000 (the maximum value), then the loop will not execute again because the next value would be 1001, which is out of the specified range.

Therefore, we need to check if the current value of `y` is 1000. If it is 1000, the loop will not execute again. If it is less than 1000, the loop will execute again with `y` incremented by 1.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `y` is currently at its maximum value of 1000 unless otherwise stated. 

Thus, if `y` is 1000, the loop will not execute again. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop will execute again with `y` incremented by 1.

Given this reasoning, we need to adjust the state based on the assumption that `y` is 1000 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is `times[K - 1]` if `times[K - 1]` is less than positive infinity, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`**
