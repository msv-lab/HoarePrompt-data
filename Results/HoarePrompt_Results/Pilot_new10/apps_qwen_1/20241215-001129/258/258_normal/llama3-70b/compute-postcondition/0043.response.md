Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations of the nested loops where `x` ranges from -1000 to 1000 and `y` ranges from -1000 to 1000, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration, `x` and `y` take on all possible integer values within their respective ranges.**
