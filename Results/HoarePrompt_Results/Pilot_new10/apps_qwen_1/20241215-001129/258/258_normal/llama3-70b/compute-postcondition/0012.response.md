The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called, and since `x` and `y` are the same, the function likely returns a list with repeated elements. However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_2`, we can assume it returns a list with the values `x` and `y`. Since `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000 and `y` is 999, the list `times` is updated to contain these values.

After the function call, `times` is sorted using `times.sort()`. Given that `x` and `y` are the same (or one of them is 999), the sorted list will contain two identical values. The exact order of these values depends on their relative values, but it will be the same since they are equal.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 999, `ans` is the minimum of `times[2]` and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is a sorted list containing `[x, x]` or `[999, 999]`**
