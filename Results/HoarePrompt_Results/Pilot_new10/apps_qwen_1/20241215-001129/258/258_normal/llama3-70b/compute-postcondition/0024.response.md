Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000.
   - `y` is -999.
   - `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers.
   - `ans` is the minimum between its original value and `times[K - 1]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for y in range(-1000, 1001):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` from -1000 to 1000 inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is -999.

4. **Determining the Next Value of `y`:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `y` in the range `-1000 to 1000`, the next value of `y` will be -998.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `x` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop.
   - `y` is now -998.
   - `times` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop.

6. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000.
   - `y` is -998.
   - `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers.
   - `ans` is the minimum between its original value and `times[K - 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is -998, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers, `ans` is the minimum between its original value and `times[K - 1]`**.
