Output State: **`The program returns ans which is the minimum value obtained from times[K - 1] across all iterations of the nested loops where x ranges from -1000 to 1000 and y ranges from -1000 to 1000, and times is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by func_2(x, y, x, y) for each iteration.`**
