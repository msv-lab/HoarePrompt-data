Functionality: **The function `func_3` iterates over all integer coordinates (x, y) where -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each coordinate, sorts the returned values from `func_2`, and stores the third largest value (K=4) from each call in a list. It then finds the minimum value from these stored values and returns this minimum value.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
- The function iterates over a range of -1000 to 1000 for both x and y.
- It calls `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each (x, y) pair.
- It stores the third largest value (since `times.sort()` sorts the values, and `times[K - 1]` gives the third largest value) from `func_2` in a list.
- It finds the minimum value from this list and returns it.

Note that the key aspect is finding the third largest value from each call to `func_2` and then determining the minimum of these values. This is different from simply returning the minimum value from `times[K - 1]` without considering the specific sorting and selection process.
