Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have executed.

### Initial State:
- `x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000.
- `y` is 1000.
- `ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.
- `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration.
- `x` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Loop Code:
```python
for y in range(-1000, 1001):
    times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
    times.sort()
    ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Range**:
   - The loop runs from `y = -1000` to `y = 1000`, inclusive.
   - This means the loop will run 2001 times (from -1000 to 1000 inclusive).

2. **Variable Changes**:
   - `y` starts at 1000 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1000.
   - `x` starts at an initial value within the range [-1000, 1000] and increments by 1 after each iteration of the loop.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2(x, y, x, y)` returns a list of up to four integers.
   - This list is sorted, and the value `times[K - 1]` is used to update `ans`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `y` will have the value `-1000`.
   - `x` will be incremented by the number of iterations, which is 2001 times. Therefore, `x` will be `initial_x + 2000`.
   - `times` will be a sorted list of up to four integers for the final `y` value (-1000).
   - `ans` will be the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations.

### Output State After All Iterations Have Finished:
- `x` will be the initial value of `x` plus 2000, i.e., `x = initial_x + 2000`.
- `y` will be -1000.
- `times` will be a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 2000, -1000, initial_x + 2000, -1000)`.
- `ans` will be the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 2000`, `y` is -1000, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 2000, -1000, initial_x + 2000, -1000)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations.**
