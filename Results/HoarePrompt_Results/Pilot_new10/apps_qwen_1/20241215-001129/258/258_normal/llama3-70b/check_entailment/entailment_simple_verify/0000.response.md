Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Despite the annotations providing insight into how the functions operate, the core issue remains the same: the program only considers integer coordinates for the heat source. The constraints and problem description do not restrict the coordinates of the heat source to integers, but rather specify that they are real numbers. Therefore, the program may miss the optimal solution, especially for cases where the optimal heat source coordinates are not integers. The provided annotations do not address this fundamental flaw in the program's logic.
