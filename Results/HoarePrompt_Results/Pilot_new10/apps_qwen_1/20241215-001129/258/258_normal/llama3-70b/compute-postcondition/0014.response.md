Output State: **`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The loop iterates over all possible values of `y` from -1000 to 1000. This means the loop will execute 2001 times in total.
2. **Inner Logic**: For each iteration, the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called, which returns a list of up to four integers. This list is then sorted.
3. **Updating `ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]` for each iteration. This ensures that `ans` holds the smallest value found among `times[K - 1]` across all iterations.
4. **Final Values**:
   - `x` remains the same throughout the loop, so it is an integer between -1000 and 1000.
   - `y` takes the last value of the range, which is 1000.
   - `ans` will be the minimum value of `times[K - 1]` found during all 2001 iterations.
   - `times` will be a sorted list of up to four integers for each iteration, but since `y` ranges from -1000 to 1000, the final value of `times` will be determined by the last call to `func_2(x, 1000, x, 1000)`.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes all iterations is:
**`x` is an integer between -1000 and 1000, `y` is 1000, `ans` is the minimum value obtained from `times[K - 1]` across all iterations, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for each iteration.**
