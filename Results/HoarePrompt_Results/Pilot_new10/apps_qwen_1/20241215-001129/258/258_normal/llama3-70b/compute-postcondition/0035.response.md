The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` calls the function `func_2` with the arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Since `x` is `initial_x + 1999` and `y` is `-999`, the function `func_2` is called with these values. The function `func_2` returns a sorted list of up to four integers, which is assigned to the variable `times`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is `initial_x + 1999`
- `y` is `-999`
- `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -999, initial_x + 1999, -999)`
- `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged

After executing the code, the variable `times` is updated to the new sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(x, y, x, y)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-999`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -999, initial_x + 1999, -999)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations and is unchanged**
