Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `x` is `initial_x + 2000`.
   - `y` is `-1000`.
   - `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 2000, -1000, initial_x + 2000, -1000)`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations.

2. **Loop Range**:
   - The loop iterates over `x` in the range from `-1000` to `1000`.

3. **Current Value of `x`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `initial_x + 2000`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be decreased by 1, so the new value of `x` will be `initial_x + 1999`.

5. **Adjusting Other Variables**:
   - Since `y` remains unchanged, `y` will still be `-1000`.
   - The function `func_2` will be called with the new value of `x` (which is `initial_x + 1999`) and the same `y` value.
   - The list `times` will be updated based on the new call to `func_2`, but since we are only interested in the initial state before updating `times` and `ans`, the current state of `times` and `ans` will remain as they were in the previous iteration.

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - `x` will be `initial_x + 1999`.
   - `y` will still be `-1000`.
   - `times` and `ans` will remain as they were in the previous iteration because we are only concerned with the state before the update.

**Final State**:
- `x` is `initial_x + 1999`.
- `y` is `-1000`.
- `times` and `ans` remain as they were in the previous iteration.

State: **`x` is `initial_x + 1999`, `y` is `-1000`, `times` is a sorted list of up to four integers returned by `func_2(initial_x + 1999, -1000, initial_x + 1999, -1000)`, `ans` is the minimum value among all `times[K - 1]` values collected during the loop iterations.**
