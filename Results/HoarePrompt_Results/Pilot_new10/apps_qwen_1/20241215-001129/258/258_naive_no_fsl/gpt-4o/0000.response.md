Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple pairs of meats could potentially share the same optimal heat source position. Specifically, the `func_1` function only checks pairs of meats and does not consider all possible combinations of meats to find the optimal heat source position that minimizes the grilling time for K or more pieces of meat.

To illustrate this, consider the sample input:
```
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40
```

The optimal heat source position found by the program is \((-0.2, 0)\), but another valid solution could be at \((0, 0)\). At \((0, 0)\), the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pieces of meat would also be ready in 2.4 seconds, which is the correct minimum time. However, the current implementation might miss this optimal solution because it only checks pairs of meats.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to find the correct solution in all cases and hence is considered incorrect.
