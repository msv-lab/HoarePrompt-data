Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that Limak can only move South if he is on the North Pole and can only move North if he is on the South Pole. Here is a case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
20000 South
10 East
20000 North
```

According to the problem description:
- Limak starts at the North Pole.
- He moves 20000 kilometers South, reaching the South Pole.
- He then moves 10 kilometers East (which does not change his latitude).
- Finally, he tries to move 20000 kilometers North from the South Pole, which is allowed.
- However, the program incorrectly allows this movement, resulting in Limak ending up at the North Pole, even though he moved 10 kilometers East during the journey.

The program does not enforce the restriction that Limak can only move North if he is on the South Pole after the initial South movement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
