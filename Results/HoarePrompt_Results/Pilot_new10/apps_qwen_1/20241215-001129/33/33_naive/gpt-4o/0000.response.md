Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that if Limak is at the North Pole, he can only move South. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
10000 South
20000 North
10000 South
```

In this case, Limak starts at the North Pole. After the first instruction, he moves 10000 kilometers South, reaching the South Pole. He then moves 20000 kilometers North, which brings him back to the North Pole. Finally, he moves another 10000 kilometers South, ending up 10000 kilometers South of the North Pole. This does not satisfy the condition that he can only move South from the North Pole.

The program does not enforce the restriction on movement from the North Pole, allowing Limak to move in any direction as long as he does not exceed the 20000-kilometer limit from the South Pole. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
