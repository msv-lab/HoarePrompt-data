The given code initializes the variable `curr_lat` to 90. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t_i`, or `dir_i`. The values of `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i` remain as per the initial state, with `n` being an integer input from the user such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), and for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), \(t_i\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\), and `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East".

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\); for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\), and `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"; `curr_lat` is 90**
