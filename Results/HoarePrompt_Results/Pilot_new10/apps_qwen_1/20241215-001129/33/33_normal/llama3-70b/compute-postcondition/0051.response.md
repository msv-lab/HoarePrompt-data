The code `print('NO')` does not affect the values of any variables; it only prints a string. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string. If `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is updated to its current value plus `t / 111.195`. If `dir` is 'South', `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. Otherwise, the value of `curr_lat` remains unchanged.**
