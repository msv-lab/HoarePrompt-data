`t` is assigned the value of `int(t)`, which converts the string `t` to an integer. The values of `curr_lat`, `n`, `dir` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string from the input.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string from the input**
