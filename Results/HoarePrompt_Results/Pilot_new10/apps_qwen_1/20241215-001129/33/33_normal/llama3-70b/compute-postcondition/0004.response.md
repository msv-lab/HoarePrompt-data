The code `t = int(t)` converts the string `t` into an integer. Since `t` was originally the second part of a split string, it could have held any value between 1 and 10^6. However, after converting it to an integer, `t` now holds its integer value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\); for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\); `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"; `t` is the integer value of the second part of the split string; `dir` is the second value of the split string.**
