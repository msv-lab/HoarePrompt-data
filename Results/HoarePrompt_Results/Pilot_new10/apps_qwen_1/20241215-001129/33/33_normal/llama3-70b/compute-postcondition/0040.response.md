The code `print('NO')` will print 'NO' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and the console prints 'NO'**
