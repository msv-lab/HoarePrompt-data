`curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`. The value of `n`, `t`, and `dir` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\) minus `t / 111.195`, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a string from the input.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\) minus `t / 111.195`, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string from the input**
