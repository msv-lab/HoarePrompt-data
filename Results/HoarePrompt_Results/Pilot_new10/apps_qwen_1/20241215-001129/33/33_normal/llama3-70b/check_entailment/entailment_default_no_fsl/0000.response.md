Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that violate the problem description:

1. **Latitude Calculation Mismatch**: The code uses a fixed value of `111.195` to convert distances into latitude degrees. However, the problem statement specifies that moving 1 kilometer along a meridian corresponds to approximately 0.01 degrees of latitude change, not 111.195. This factor should be used instead.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the edge case where Limak moves exactly 20,000 kilometers South from the North Pole, which should result in him reaching the South Pole. The current implementation allows this scenario and continues the journey, violating the requirement that Limak must be on the North Pole after the journey.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 100
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 100
        elif dir == 'West' or dir == 'East':
            # These directions do not affect the latitude, so we can ignore them
            continue
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid direction: {dir}")
        
        # Check if latitude exceeds valid range
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            return
        
        # Check if the current latitude is -90 or 90 and the direction is not allowed
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            return
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            return
    
    # Check if the final latitude is 90 (North Pole)
    if curr_lat == 90:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The conversion factor from kilometers to degrees of latitude is set to `100`.
- The code properly handles invalid directions by raising an error.
- The code ensures that Limak cannot move to a latitude outside the valid range (-90 to 90).
- The code correctly enforces the rule that Limak must be at the North Pole at the end of the journey.

Given these corrections, the initial code was incorrect for some cases, hence the output is **False**.
