The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. This means that no further instructions will be executed, and all variables will retain their current values. The console print statement will also not execute.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and the console prints 'NO'**
