The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `curr_lat`, `n`, `t`, or `dir`. The precondition that `curr_lat` remains within the range \([-90, 90]\) and that `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, and `dir` is a string is still valid.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and the console prints 'NO'**
