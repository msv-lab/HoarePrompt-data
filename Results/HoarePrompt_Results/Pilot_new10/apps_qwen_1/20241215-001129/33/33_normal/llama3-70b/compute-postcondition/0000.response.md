The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`, and for each `i` from `1` to `n`, `t_{i}` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6`, and `dir_{i}` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East". After executing the code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided by the user, while the values of `t_{i}` and `dir_{i}` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user (with 1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and for each `i` from `1` to `n`, `t_{i}` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6`, and `dir_{i}` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East".**
