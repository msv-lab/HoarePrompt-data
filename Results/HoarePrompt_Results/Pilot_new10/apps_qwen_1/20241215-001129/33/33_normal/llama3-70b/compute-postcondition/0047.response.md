`curr_lat` is reduced by `t / 111.195`. The value of `t` is an integer obtained from the input, and `curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\). The other variables (`n`, `t`, `dir`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, `t` is the first part of the input, `dir` is the second part of the input, and `t` is now converted to an integer, `curr_lat` is decreased by `t / 111.195`.**
