`curr_lat` is updated by adding `t / 111.195` to its current value. Since `t` is now an integer, the division operation will yield a floating-point number. The value of `curr_lat` will change accordingly, but the range constraint remains the same.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\); `n` is greater than 0; `t` is an integer; `dir` is a string; `t` is the first part of the input; `dir` is the second part of the input; `curr_lat` is updated to its current value plus `t / 111.195`.**
