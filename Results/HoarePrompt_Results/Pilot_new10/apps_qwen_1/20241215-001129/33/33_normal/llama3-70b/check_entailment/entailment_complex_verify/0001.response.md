Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically:
1. The program ensures that if Limak is at the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`), he can only move South.
2. The program ensures that if Limak is at the South Pole (`curr_lat == -90`), he can only move North.
3. The program ensures that the journey ends on the North Pole (`curr_lat == 90`).

The original assessment was incorrect because the program actually enforces the necessary constraints as described in the problem. The annotations clarify that the program checks these conditions correctly, and the implementation aligns with the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
