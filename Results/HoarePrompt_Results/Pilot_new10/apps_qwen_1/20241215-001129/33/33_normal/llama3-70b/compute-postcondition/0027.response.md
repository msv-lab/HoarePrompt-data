The code `t, dir = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `t` and the second part to `dir`. The initial state of `curr_lat` being within the range \([-90, 90]\) and `n` being greater than 0 remains unchanged. However, the values of `t` and `dir` are now defined based on the input.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a string from the input, `dir` is a string from the input**
