The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program. This means that no further operations will be performed, and the current state of the variables will be the final state.

The initial conditions are:
- `curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `t` is an integer
- `dir` is a string

The value of `curr_lat` changes based on the value of `dir` and the calculation `t / 111.195`.

Since the program terminates immediately after executing `exit()`, the values of `n`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. The value of `curr_lat` also remains unchanged unless it was modified according to the conditions specified.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and the program exits.**
