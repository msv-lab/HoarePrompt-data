The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately without changing any variable values. All previously defined variables retain their original states.

Output State: **`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\), `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
