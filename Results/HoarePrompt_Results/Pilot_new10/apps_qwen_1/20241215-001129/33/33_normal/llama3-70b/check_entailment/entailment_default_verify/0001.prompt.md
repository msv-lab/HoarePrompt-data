You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

10000 North

Output
YES

20000 North

Output
NO

Input
2
1000 North
1000 South

Output
NO

Input
4
50 South
50 North
15000 South
15000 North

Output
YES



-----Note-----

Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    curr_lat = 90
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            curr_lat += t / 111.195
        elif dir == 'South':
            curr_lat -= t / 111.195
        else:
            continue
        if curr_lat < -90 or curr_lat > 90:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == -90 and dir != 'North':
            print('NO')
            exit()
        if curr_lat == 90 and dir != 'South':
            print('NO')
            exit()
    print('YES' if curr_lat == 90 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the constraints for moving from the North Pole or the South Pole. Specifically, it allows movements other than "South" when at the North Pole and other than "North" when at the South Pole, which violates the problem description. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
20000 South
10000 East
```

According to the problem description, after moving 20000 kilometers South from the North Pole, Limak should be at the South Pole. However, the program allows him to move 10000 kilometers East from the South Pole, which is not allowed since he cannot move East or West from the South Pole. This input should result in "NO", but the program does not handle this case correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function processes a series of movements defined by integers and direction strings, where the latitude changes based on the movement direction and distance. It checks if the final latitude is exactly 90° North or not, and prints 'YES' if the latitude is 90° North, and 'NO' if it is not, considering potential edge cases like exceeding the latitude limits (-90° to 90°) or invalid directions. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
