Postcondition: ***`curr_lat` is within the range \([-90, 90]\). If `curr_lat` is 90 and `dir` is not "South", then the function does nothing. If `curr_lat` is -90 and `dir` is not "North", the program terminates without changing `curr_lat`. In all other cases, the program continues execution without modifying `curr_lat`***.
