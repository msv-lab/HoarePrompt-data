The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to process a series of directions (t_{i}) and directions (dir_{i}) where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each i from 1 to n, t_{i} is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, and dir_{i} is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East". The output depends on the processing of these inputs, but since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters, we focus on the constraints given.

Based on the constraints, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of movements defined by integers and direction strings, but without explicit parameter acceptance in the function signature.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of movements defined by integers and direction strings where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each i from 1 to n, 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6 and dir_{i} is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East", but does not accept any parameters explicitly in its definition.**
