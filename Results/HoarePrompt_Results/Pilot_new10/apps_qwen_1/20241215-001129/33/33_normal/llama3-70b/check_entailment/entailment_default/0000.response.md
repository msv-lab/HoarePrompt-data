Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code uses a simplified conversion factor of 111.195 km/° for latitude changes, which is inaccurate for the given scenario. The circumference of the Earth at the equator is approximately 40,000 km, so moving 1 degree of latitude actually corresponds to moving \( \frac{40000}{360} \approx 111.111 \) km, not 111.195 km. This discrepancy leads to incorrect latitude calculations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
7500 South
10000 East
3500 North
4444 West
4000 North
```

Using the correct conversion factor of 111.111 km/°, the latitude changes would be calculated as follows:
- Starting from the North Pole (latitude = 90°).
- Moving 7500 km South: \( 90 - \frac{7500}{111.111} \approx 90 - 67.4 \approx 22.6 \)°.
- Moving 10000 km East: No change in latitude.
- Moving 3500 km North: \( 22.6 + \frac{3500}{111.111} \approx 22.6 + 31.5 \approx 54.1 \)°.
- Moving 4444 km West: No change in latitude.
- Moving 4000 km North: \( 54.1 + \frac{4000}{111.111} \approx 54.1 + 36 \approx 90.1 \)°.

Thus, the final latitude is approximately 90.1°, which should result in "YES". However, the provided code using 111.195 km/° would incorrectly calculate the final latitude, leading to a wrong result.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
