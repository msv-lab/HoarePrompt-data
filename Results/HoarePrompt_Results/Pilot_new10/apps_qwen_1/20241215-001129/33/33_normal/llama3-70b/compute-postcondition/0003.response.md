`t` and `dir` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string. The first value of the split string is assigned to `t`, and the second value is assigned to `dir`. The values of `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i` for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 50\); for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\), `t_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^6\); `dir_i` is one of the strings "North", "South", "West", "East"; `t` is the first value of the split string; `dir` is the second value of the split string.**
