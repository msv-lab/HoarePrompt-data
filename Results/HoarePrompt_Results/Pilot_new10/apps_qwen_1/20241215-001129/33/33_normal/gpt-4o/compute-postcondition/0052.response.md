`position` is incremented by `t`. The value of `n`, `valid`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged. The condition that if `position + t > 20000`, the condition remains unchanged, still applies. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input string after splitting, and `position` is updated to `position + t`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `position` is updated to `position + t`, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input string after splitting.**
