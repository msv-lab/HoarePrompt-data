Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input string after splitting. If `position - t < 0`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.***
