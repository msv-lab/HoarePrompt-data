The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to work with variables `n`, `t_i`, and `dir_i` which are not defined within the function's scope but are mentioned in the parameter constraints. The function processes `n` integers `t_i` and directions `dir_i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. Based on the given constraints, the function does not return any value directly but rather processes the input data.

However, following the provided format strictly, we can describe the functionality as:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, processes `n` integers `t_i` and directions `dir_i` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `t_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6, and `dir_i` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East".**
