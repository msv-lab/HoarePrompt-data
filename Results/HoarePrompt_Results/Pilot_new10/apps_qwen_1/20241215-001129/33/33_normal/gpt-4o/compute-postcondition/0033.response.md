The code `position -= t` updates the value of `position` by subtracting `t` from it. Given the precondition that `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, and considering the operation, the new value of `position` will be `position - t`. However, since the exact value of `t` is not specified, we can only express the updated value in terms of `t`.

The states of the other variables (`valid`, `n`, `dir`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000 - `t`; `valid` is `False`; `t` is an integer; `dir` is the other part of the input string.**
