`position` is incremented by `t`. Since `t` is an integer, `position` will be updated to `position + t`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000 - `t`, `valid` remains `False`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the other part of the input string.**
