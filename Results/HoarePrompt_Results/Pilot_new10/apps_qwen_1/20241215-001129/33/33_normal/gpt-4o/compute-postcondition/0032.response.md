Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1; `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000; `valid` is `False`; `t` is an integer; `dir` is the other part of the input string. If `position - t < 0`, then `valid` remains `False`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change from the if part.***
