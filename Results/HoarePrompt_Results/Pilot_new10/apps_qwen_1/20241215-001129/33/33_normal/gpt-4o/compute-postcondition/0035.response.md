Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` remains `False`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the other part of the input string. If `position + t` is greater than 20000, `valid` remains `False`. There is no else part in the code, so the condition does not change `valid`.***
