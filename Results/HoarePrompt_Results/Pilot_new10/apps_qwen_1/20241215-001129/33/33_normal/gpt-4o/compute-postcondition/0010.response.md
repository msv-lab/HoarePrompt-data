`position` is decremented by `t`. Since `position` was initially 0 and `t` is an integer, subtracting a positive integer from 0 will make `position` negative. The value of `n`, `valid`, `t`, and `dir` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1; `position` is less than 0; `valid` is `False`; `t` is an integer; the direction `dir` is 'North'.**
