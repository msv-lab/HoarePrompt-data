Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `position` is an integer between 0 and 20000 inclusive, `valid` is True, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `dir` is one of "North", "South", "West", "East". The current value of `valid` is True since the condition inside the if statement evaluates to True.***
