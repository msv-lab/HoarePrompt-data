Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `position` is 0, `valid` is `True`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is 'South'***

Explanation: The postcondition retains all the information from the precondition and includes the additional condition from the if statement (`dir == 'South'`). Since the if condition is met, `dir` is explicitly stated as 'South'.
