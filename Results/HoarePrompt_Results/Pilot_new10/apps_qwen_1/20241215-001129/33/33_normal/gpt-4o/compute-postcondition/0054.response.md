Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `position` is either less than 0 or greater than 20000, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer, `dir` is the second part of the input string after splitting. Since the if condition `position == 0 or position == 20000` does not change the values of the variables and only checks for the condition, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
