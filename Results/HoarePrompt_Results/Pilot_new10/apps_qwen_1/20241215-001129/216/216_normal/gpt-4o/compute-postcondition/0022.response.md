The line `current_count = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `current_count`. This initializes `current_count` to 0. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `max_count`, and `current_set`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any character seen so far, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0.**
