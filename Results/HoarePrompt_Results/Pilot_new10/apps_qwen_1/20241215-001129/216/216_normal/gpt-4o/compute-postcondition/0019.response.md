Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any character seen so far, `current_set` is a set that either contains the current character with `current_count` incremented to 1 (previously `current_count`), or remains unchanged, the current character processed is the next character in the string `s`, and if the current character is not in `current_set`, it is added to `current_set` and `current_count` is increased by 1.***
