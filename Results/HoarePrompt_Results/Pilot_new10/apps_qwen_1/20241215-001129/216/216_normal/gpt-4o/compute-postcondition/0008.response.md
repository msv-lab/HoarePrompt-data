The code `current_set.add(char)` adds the current character to the `current_set`. Given the initial state where `current_set` is an empty set and the current character is a lowercase letter not already in `current_set`, adding the character to the set will change the state of `current_set`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing the current character, `current_count` is 0, the current character processed is a lowercase letter, the current character is in `current_set`**
