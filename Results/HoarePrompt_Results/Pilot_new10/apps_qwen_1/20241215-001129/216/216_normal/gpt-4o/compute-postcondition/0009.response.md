The code increments the value of `current_count` by 1. The initial value of `current_count` is 0, so after executing the line `current_count += 1`, `current_count` becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `max_count`, `current_set`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing the current character, `current_count` is 1, the current character processed is a lowercase letter, the current character is in `current_set`**
