The code `current_set.add(char)` adds the current character (`char`) to the set `current_set` if it is a lowercase letter and not already in `current_set`. This operation does not change the value of `max_count` or `n`, and it increments `current_count` by 1 regardless of whether the character was added to `current_set` or not.

Given this, the updated values are:
- `current_set` is updated to include the character `char` if it meets the specified conditions.
- `current_count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a non-empty string, `max_count` is the maximum count of any character seen so far, `current_set` either contains the next character in `s` (if it is lowercase and not already in `current_set`) or remains unchanged, `current_count` is incremented by 1.**
