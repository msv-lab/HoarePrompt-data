The code `print(len(lowercase))` prints the length of the `lowercase` list, which contains the indices of all lowercase characters in the string `s`. The length of the `lowercase` list does not change the values of `n` or `s`, but it is printed. The output state will include the length of the `lowercase` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `s` is the string entered by the user, `lowercase` is a list of indices of all lowercase characters in `s`, the length of `lowercase` is printed**
