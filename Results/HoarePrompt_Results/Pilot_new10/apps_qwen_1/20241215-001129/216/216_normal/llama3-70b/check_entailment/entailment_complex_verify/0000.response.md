Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code shows that the program currently only identifies the positions of lowercase letters in the string and prints their count. It does not ensure that there are no uppercase letters between the selected positions, which is a crucial part of the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate as the current implementation does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
