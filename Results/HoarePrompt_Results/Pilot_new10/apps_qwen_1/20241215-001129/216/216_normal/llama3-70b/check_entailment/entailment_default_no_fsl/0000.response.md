Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not take into account the requirement that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters. The code simply collects all the positions of lowercase letters and prints their count, which does not satisfy the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected positions.

For example, consider the input:
```
11
aaaaBaabAbA
```
The output of the provided code would be `4`, but the correct output should be `2` as explained in the problem note. The code fails to check for the presence of uppercase letters between the selected lowercase letters.
