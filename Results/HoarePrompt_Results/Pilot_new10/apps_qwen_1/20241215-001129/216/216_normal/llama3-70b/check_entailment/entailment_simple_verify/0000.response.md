Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated code shows that the program only checks for lowercase letters and does not consider the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the selected positions. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment correctly identifies this issue.
