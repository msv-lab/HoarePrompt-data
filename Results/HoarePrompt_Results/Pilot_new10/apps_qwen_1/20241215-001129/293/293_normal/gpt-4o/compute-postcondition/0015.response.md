`visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` was 1, so now it becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 2, `path` is non-empty (with one less element), `current_level` is 1, `direction` is the first element of the updated `path`.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 2, `path` is non-empty (with one less element), `current_level` is 1, `direction` is the first element of the updated `path`**
