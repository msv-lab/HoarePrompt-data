The code updates the `current_node` by setting it to `2 * current_node + 2`. According to the initial state, `current_node` should be calculated using the initial value of `current_level` which is 1. 

Given:
- `current_level` is 1.

The formula `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` translates to:
- `current_node = 2 * 1 + 2 = 4`.

The states of the other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, and `direction`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 2, `path` is non-empty (with one less element), `current_level` is 1, `direction` is the first element of the updated `path`, `current_node` is 4**
