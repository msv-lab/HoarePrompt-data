The code updates the value of `current_node` to `2 * current_node + 2`. Initially, `current_node` is either \(2 \times current_node + 1\) or 4. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `current_node` is \(2 \times current_node + 1\):
   - Since `current_node` cannot be equal to \(2 \times current_node + 1\) (this would imply \(current_node = -1\), which is not possible given the context), this case does not apply.

2. If `current_node` is 4:
   - After updating, `current_node` becomes \(2 \times 4 + 2 = 10\).

The other variables (`total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, and `current_level`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `current_node` is 10.

Output State: **`total_leaves` is \(2^h\), `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty list with two less elements, `current_level` is 1, and `current_node` is 10.**
