The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not perform any operation that assigns a value to `h` or `n`. Instead, it reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`, which changes how the `input()` function is used in the program. However, this change does not affect the values of `h` and `n`.

Therefore, the values of `h` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}.**
