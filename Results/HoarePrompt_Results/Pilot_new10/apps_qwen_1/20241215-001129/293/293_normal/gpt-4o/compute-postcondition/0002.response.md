The code initializes `total_leaves` to \(2^h\). The value of `h` remains unchanged, and `n` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `total_leaves` is now set to \(2^h\).

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ \(2^h\); `total_leaves` is \(2^h\)**
