`ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`. The initial value of `n` is greater than 1, but the exact value is not specified. Therefore, `n // 2 - 1` will be an integer value depending on the value of `n`. The state of `n` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `ans` is `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`**
