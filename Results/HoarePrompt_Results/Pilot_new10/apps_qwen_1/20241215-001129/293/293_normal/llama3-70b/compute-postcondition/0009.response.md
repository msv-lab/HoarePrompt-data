To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

### Initial Conditions:
- `h` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 50\).
- `n` is `n_initial // 2` where `n_initial` is an input integer such that \(1 < n_initial \leq 2^h\).
- `ans` is updated based on whether `n` is even or odd:
  - If `n` is even, `ans` is `n // 2 - 1`.
  - If `n` is odd, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while n > 1:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 1.

### Current State:
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the value of `n_initial // 2` after the previous iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `n > 1`.

### Analysis:
Since the loop continues as long as `n > 1`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the next iteration. The only state that directly affects this condition is `n`.

### Adjustment Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
No other states need adjustment because the only condition for the loop to continue is `n > 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
