The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Given the initial state where `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^h\) and \(n > 1\), the new value of `n` will be half of its original value (floored).

Let's denote the initial value of `n` as `n_initial`. After the operation, `n` becomes `n_initial // 2`.

Since the exact initial value of `n` is not specified, we can represent the new value of `n` in terms of the original value.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is `n_initial // 2` where `n_initial` is an input integer such that 1 < `n_initial` ≤ 2^`h`; `ans` is updated based on whether `n` is even or odd: if `n` is even, `ans` is `n // 2 - 1`; if `n` is odd, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2**.
