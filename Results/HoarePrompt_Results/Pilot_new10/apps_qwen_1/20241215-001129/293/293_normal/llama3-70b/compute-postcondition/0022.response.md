Let's analyze the provided code step by step:

1. The function `func` accepts two parameters, `h` and `n`, via `input()`. These values are split and converted to integers.
2. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
3. A loop runs while `n` is greater than 1.
4. Inside the loop:
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`.
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 != 0`), `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`.
5. After each iteration, `n` is halved (`n //= 2`).
6. The loop terminates when `n` becomes 1.
7. Finally, the value of `ans` is printed.

Now, let's summarize the functionality considering all potential cases:

Functionality: **The function reads two integers `h` and `n` from input where `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`. It calculates a sum `ans` by iterating over the binary representation of `n`, halving `n` each time and adding either `n // 2 - 1` or `n // 2` to `ans` depending on whether `n` is even or odd. The function then prints the final value of `ans`.**
