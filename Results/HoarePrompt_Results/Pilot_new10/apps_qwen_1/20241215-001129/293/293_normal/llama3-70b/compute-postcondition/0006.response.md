`ans` is incremented by `n // 2`. Since `n` is odd, `n // 2` results in an integer division which is equivalent to `(n - 1) // 2`. The initial value of `ans` is 0, so `ans` will be updated to `(n - 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^`h` and `n` must be greater than 1; `ans` is (n - 1) // 2, and `n` is odd**
