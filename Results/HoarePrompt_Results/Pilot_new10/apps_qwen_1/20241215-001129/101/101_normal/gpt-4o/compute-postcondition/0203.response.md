Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a list of lists where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in the `screen` list with the boundary elements set to `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each row (`i`) from `top` to `bottom` and each column (`j`) from `left` to `right`.
- For each element on the boundary (where `i` is `top` or `bottom` or `j` is `left` or `right`), if the element is `'.'`, it is changed to `'+'`.
- After the loop completes, all boundary elements in the `result` list will be `'+'` if they were originally `'.'`, while the rest of the elements will remain unchanged from the original `screen` list.

Since the loop iterates until all boundary elements are checked and updated, the final state of the `result` list will reflect these changes. The `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` indices define the frame, and the `frame_height` and `frame_width` remain unchanged unless the loop modifies the elements within the boundaries.
