According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values of the variables are as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w".
- `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found.
- `i` is `n`
- `j` is `m`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from its current value of `n` to `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` becomes `n - 1`.

Since the loop is iterating over rows (`i`), and there is no change to `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`, these values remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`**.
