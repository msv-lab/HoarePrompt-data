The code sets `left` and `right` to the value of `j`. Given the initial state, `j` is equal to 1. Therefore, both `left` and `right` are updated to 1.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `0`, `bottom` is `0`, `i` is `0`, and `j` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `0`, `bottom` is `0`, `left` is `1`, `right` is `1`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `1**.
