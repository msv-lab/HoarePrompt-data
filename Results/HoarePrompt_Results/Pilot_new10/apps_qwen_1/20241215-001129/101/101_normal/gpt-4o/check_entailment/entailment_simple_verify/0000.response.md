Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the smallest possible frame that encompasses all white pixels while ensuring that the frame does not go beyond the borders of the screen. The logic to find the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the white pixels is accurate. If these boundaries form a valid frame (i.e., the height and width are both at least 2), the program constructs the frame using '+' characters. If no such frame exists, the program returns -1. The annotated version confirms that the program handles all cases as specified in the problem description.
