Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". If `i > bottom`, `i` is updated to be less than `top`, `bottom` is now `i`, and `left` and `right` are the smallest and largest column indices where 'w' is found in the range from `top` to `i`. If `i \(\leq\) bottom`, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
