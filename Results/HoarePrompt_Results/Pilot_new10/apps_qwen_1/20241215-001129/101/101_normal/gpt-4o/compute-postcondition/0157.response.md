Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w', `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. For the rows and columns that satisfy the condition \(i == top\) or \(i == bottom\) or \(j == left\) or \((j == right)\), the corresponding elements in `screen` are 'w'.***
