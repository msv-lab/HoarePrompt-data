Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
   - `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`
   - `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found
   - `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found
   - `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found
   - `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`
   - `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
   - `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
   - `i` is `bottom + 1`
   - `j` is `right + 1`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop iterates over rows from `top` to `bottom` inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `bottom + 1`, which means the loop has just finished processing the row at `bottom`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop iterates from `top` to `bottom`, the next row to process would be `top`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `top`.

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` should be set to `top`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `top`**.
