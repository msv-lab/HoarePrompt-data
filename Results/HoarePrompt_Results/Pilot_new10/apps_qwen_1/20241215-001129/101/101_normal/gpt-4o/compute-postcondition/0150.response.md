The code calculates `frame_width` as the difference between `right` and `left` plus 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `frame_height` are not affected by this line of code.

The updated value of `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w', `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1**.
