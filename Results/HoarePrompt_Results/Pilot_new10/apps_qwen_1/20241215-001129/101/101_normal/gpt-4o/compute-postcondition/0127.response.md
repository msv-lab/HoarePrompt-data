The code `right = j` updates the value of `right` to the current value of `j`. Based on the initial state, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and still satisfies the condition of being less than `m`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and still satisfies the condition of being less than `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `j`, `right` is `j`.**
