Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `n - 1`, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found, `i` is now less than `top` (since `i` was updated to be less than `top` in the precondition), and `j` is `0`. The condition `(i > bottom)` is true.***
