Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". If `i < top`, then `top` remains `0`, `bottom` remains `0`, `left` remains `1`, and `right` remains `1`. Otherwise, the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.***
