The code snippet `result = [list(row) for row in screen]` creates a new list of lists where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in the `screen` list. This operation does not change the original `screen` list or the values of the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width`. 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the addition of the `result` variable which now holds a copy of the `screen` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is the smallest row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w', `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`, and `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2; `result` is a list of lists where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in the `screen` list.**
