`right` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is within the range `[1, m-1]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `j` is in the range `[1, m-1]`, `right` is equal to `j`, and the state of the program remains unchanged for other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `j` is in the range `[1, m-1]`, `right` is equal to `j`.**
