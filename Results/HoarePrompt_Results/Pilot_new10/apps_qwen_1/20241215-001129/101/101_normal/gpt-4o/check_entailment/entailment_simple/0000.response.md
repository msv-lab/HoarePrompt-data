Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions of the monitor (n, m) and the state of the screen as specified in the problem description. It ensures that the screen contains at least one white pixel, which is validated through the initial processing.

2. **Finding Boundaries**: The program correctly identifies the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the white pixels using nested loops. These boundaries represent the smallest rectangle that encloses all white pixels.

3. **Validation of Frame Size**: The program checks if the identified rectangle can form a valid frame with a width of at least 2 pixels. If the height or width of the identified rectangle is less than 2, it returns `-1` as no valid frame exists.

4. **Constructing the Result**: If a valid frame is found, the program constructs a new representation of the screen with the identified boundary pixels marked as `+`. It ensures that no changes are made to the existing white pixels.

5. **Output**: The program prints the modified screen according to the rules described, ensuring that the frame is the smallest possible and that it correctly marks the boundary pixels.

Given these points, the program consistently follows the problem description across all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
