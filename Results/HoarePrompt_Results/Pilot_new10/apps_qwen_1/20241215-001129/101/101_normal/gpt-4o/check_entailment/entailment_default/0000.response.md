Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly identify the smallest possible square frame for all potential cases. Specifically, the code only checks the boundaries where white pixels are found and does not ensure that the entire white area is enclosed by the frame. Here is an example where the code fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4 8
..w....w
........
........
..w....w
```

The correct output should be:
```
..w++++w
++.+.....
++.+.....
..w++++w
```

However, the current implementation of `func_1` will not correctly identify this as the smallest possible frame. It will incorrectly return:
```
..w++++w
..+.....
..+.....
..w++++w
```

This happens because the code only considers the first and last positions of white pixels to define the frame boundaries, without checking if there are any gaps within the white area that need to be filled to form a complete square frame.

To fix this, the code needs to check for gaps between the identified white pixel boundaries and ensure that the entire white area is enclosed by the frame.
