Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w". `top`, `bottom`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `j < left`, then `left` is set to `j`.***
