Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is either `i` or `None`, `bottom` is `0`, `left` is `0`, `right` is `None`, `i` is `0`, and `j` is `0`. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the condition `(i > bottom)` is true. Since the if condition checks if `j > right`, and `right` is `None`, the if condition will always be false (because `right` being `None` implies no upper limit). Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition without any modifications.***
