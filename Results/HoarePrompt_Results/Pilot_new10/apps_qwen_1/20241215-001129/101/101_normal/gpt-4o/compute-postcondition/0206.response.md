Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `screen`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2000\), and `screen` is a list of `n` strings, where each string contains exactly `m` characters. The characters in the strings are either "." (representing black pixels) or "w" (representing white pixels). The function finds the smallest and largest row and column indices where "w" is found and sets the boundary elements (top, bottom, left, and right sides) of the white region to "+" if they were originally ".". If no white pixels are found or if the resulting frame dimensions are less than 2x2, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the modified `screen` list with the boundary elements set to "+" if they were originally ".".**
