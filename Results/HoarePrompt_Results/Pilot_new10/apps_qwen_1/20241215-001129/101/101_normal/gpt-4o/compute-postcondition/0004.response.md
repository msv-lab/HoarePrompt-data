Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `None`, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'***

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and incorporates the given if condition without specifying how the program operates, focusing solely on the variable values and their interrelations.
