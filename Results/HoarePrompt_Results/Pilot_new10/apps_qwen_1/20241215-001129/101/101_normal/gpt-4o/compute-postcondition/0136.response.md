The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bottom`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value of `bottom` will also be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j + 1`, `right` is `j + 1`.

Output State: **`total` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j + 1`, `right` is `j + 1`**.
