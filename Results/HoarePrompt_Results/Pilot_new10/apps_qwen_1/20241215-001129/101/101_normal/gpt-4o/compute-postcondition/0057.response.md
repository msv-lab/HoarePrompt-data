The code `top = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `top`. Initially, `i` is set to `n - 1`. Therefore, `top` will now be `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is `n - 1`, `bottom` is the largest row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the smallest column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found, `i` is \(n - 1\) and its value is now \(i < top\), `j` is `0`**.
