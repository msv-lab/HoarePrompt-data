The code sets `left` to the current value of `j`. Since `j` was previously incremented by 1, its new value is what is now assigned to `left`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `j + 1`, `right` is `j + 1`.**
