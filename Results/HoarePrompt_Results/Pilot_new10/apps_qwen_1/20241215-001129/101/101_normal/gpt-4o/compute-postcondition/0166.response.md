According to the code, the loop iterates over columns from `left` to `right + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\)
- `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`
- `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found
- `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found
- `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found
- `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`
- `j` is the next column index (`k + 1`)
- `result[i][j]` is `'+'` if it was originally `'.'`, otherwise it remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `j` must be within the range `[left, right]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `right`.

Since `j` is the next column index (`k + 1`), the new value of `j` should be `k + 2` (as `k` is the previous value of `j`).

So, the updated state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `j` is the next column index (`k + 2`), and `result[i][j]` is `'+'` if it was originally `'.'`, otherwise it remains unchanged.**
