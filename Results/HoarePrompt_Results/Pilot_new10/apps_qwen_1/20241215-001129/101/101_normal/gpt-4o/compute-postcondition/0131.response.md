Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and still satisfies the condition of being less than `m`.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
   - `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w".
   - `top` is 1.
   - `bottom` is 1 or `i`.
   - `left` is `j`.
   - `right` is `j` or `j` (updated to `j` if `j > right`).
   - If `screen[i][j] == 'w'`, then `bottom` is `i`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is still less than `m`.
   - This means that `j` is now `j + 1` and still needs to be less than `m` to continue the loop.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - `total` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so it is now `j + 1`.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `screen` remains the same.
   - `top` remains 1.
   - `bottom` remains 1 or `i` (which is 1).
   - `left` remains `j` but updated to `j + 1`.
   - `right` remains `j` or `j` (updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is still less than `m`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1 or `i` (which is 1), `left` is `j` but updated to `j + 1`, and `right` is `j` or `j + 1` (updated to `j + 1` if `j + 1 > right`).**
