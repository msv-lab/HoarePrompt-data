The value of `left` is assigned the value of `j`. Since `j` is less than `left`, after executing `left = j`, the value of `left` will be equal to `j`, and all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top`, `bottom`, `right`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, `left` is equal to `j`.**
