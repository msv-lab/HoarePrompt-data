The code sets `left` to be equal to `right` and also assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, the values of `left` and `right` are both set to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `i` remains unchanged, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1.**
