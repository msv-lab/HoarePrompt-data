Let's analyze the given code and the initial states step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\).
- `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`.
- `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found.
- `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found.
- `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found.
- `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`.
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over columns from `left` to `right` inclusive.
- The loop can only execute if there are at least one column between `left` and `right` (i.e., `right >= left + 1`).

### Adjusted States:
- We need to ensure that the loop can execute, meaning `right` should be at least one more than `left`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` remains unchanged except for the boundary elements which are now `'+'`, `top` is the smallest row index where `'w'` is found, `bottom` is the largest row index where `'w'` is found, `left` is the smallest column index where `'w'` is found, `right` is the largest column index where `'w'`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `right` is at least one more than `left` (`right >= left + 1`).**
