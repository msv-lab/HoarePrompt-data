The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. The value of `j` is the column index where 'w' is found, and it satisfies the condition of being less than `left`. Therefore, after the assignment, `left` will have the value of `j`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`total` is not mentioned and remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is the column index where 'w' is found, `j` satisfies the condition of being less than `left`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2000\), `screen` is a list of `n` strings where each string contains exactly `m` characters, and the characters are either "." or "w", `top` is 1, `bottom` is the same as before (as `i` is greater than `bottom`), `left` is now `j`, `right` is the largest column index where 'w' is found, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `j` is less than `left`.**
