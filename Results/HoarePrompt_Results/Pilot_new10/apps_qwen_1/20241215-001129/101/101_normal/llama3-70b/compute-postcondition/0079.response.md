The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop specified, the `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `m`, or `j`. The preconditions also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `m`**
