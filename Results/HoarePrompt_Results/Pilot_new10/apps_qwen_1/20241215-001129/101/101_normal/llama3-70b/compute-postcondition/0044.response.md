Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `pixels` is a 2D list. `j` is 0. The current value of `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or the current value of `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`. Additionally, the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list is equal to '.'***
