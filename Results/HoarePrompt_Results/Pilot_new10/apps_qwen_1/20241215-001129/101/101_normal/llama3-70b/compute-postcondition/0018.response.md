According to the given code and the provided state before the loop starts, the loop will iterate over the variable `i`, which ranges from `0` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute, the value of `i` must start from `0` and `n` must be greater than `0`.

Let's break down the states that need adjustment:

1. **`n` must be greater than 0**: This ensures that the loop has at least one iteration.
2. **`i` must be 0**: This is the starting point for the loop.

The other variables (`m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition but might be relevant within the loop body. However, we are only concerned with the initial state required for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
