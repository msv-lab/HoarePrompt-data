Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and either `i` is not equal to `min_x` or `i` is not equal to `max_x` or `j` is not equal to `min_y` or `j` is not equal to `max_y`. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the condition remains as is; otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is set to '.'.**
