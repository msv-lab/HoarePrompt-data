The code changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. The conditions related to `i`, `j`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and either `i` is not equal to `min_x` or `i` is not equal to `max_x` or `j` is not equal to `min_y` or `j` is not equal to `max_y` or `pixels[i][j]` is equal to `'.'`**
