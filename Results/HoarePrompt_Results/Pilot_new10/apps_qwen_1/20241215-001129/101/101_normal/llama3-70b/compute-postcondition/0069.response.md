The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` updates the pixel at position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` 2D list to `'+'`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, this corresponds to the boundary of the 2D list because `pixels[2][0]` is on the boundary (`i` is not on the boundary since no min_x or max_x is mentioned, but `j` is 0 which is on the boundary).

Therefore, `pixels[2][0]` is updated to `'+'`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where all boundary pixels are set to `'+'` and all other pixels are set to `'.'` unless they are `'w'`, in which case they remain unchanged, the current value of `j` is 0, and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'`.**
