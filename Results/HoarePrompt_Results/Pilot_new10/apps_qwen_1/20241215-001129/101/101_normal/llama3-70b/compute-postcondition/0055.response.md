The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `n` and `m` staying greater than 0 and the structure of `pixels` as a 2D list also remain intact.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list, `j` is 1**
