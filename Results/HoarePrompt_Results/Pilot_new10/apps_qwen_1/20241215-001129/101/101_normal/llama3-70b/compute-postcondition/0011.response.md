The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` by setting them to the minimum of their current values and the new values `x` and `y`, respectively. However, since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can only express the updated values in terms of these variables and their initial values.

Given the initial conditions:
- `min_x` is `min(min_x, x)`
- `min_y` is `min(min_y, y)`

After executing the code:
- `min_x` becomes `min(min_x, x)`
- `min_y` becomes `min(min_y, y)`

Therefore, the updated values of `min_x` and `min_y` reflect the minimums between their current values and `x` and `y`, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and must have at least one tuple left, `min_x` is `min(min_x, x)`, `min_y` is `min(min_y, y)`**
