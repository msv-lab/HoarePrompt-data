The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` changes the pixel at position `(i, j)` from `'.'` to `'+')`. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and the other pixels in the `pixels` list remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list is `'+', and either `i` being equal to `min_x`, `i` being equal to `max_x`, `j` being equal to `min_y`, or `j` being equal to `max_y`.**
