The code sets the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'`. Given the initial values of `i` and `j`, and the nature of the 2D list `pixels`, this assignment updates the specific element in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][1]` is '.', `j` is 1**
