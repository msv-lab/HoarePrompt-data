The code assigns the value `+` to the element in the `pixels` list at index `[i][j]`. Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `j` are unchanged, but `i` remains 0, and the value at `pixels[0][j]` is now `+`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be less than `m`; `pixels[0][j]` is '+'**
