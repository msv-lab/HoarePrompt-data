The `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop body and moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the variables `i`, `n`, `m`, and `pixels` remain unchanged from their initial values. 

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where all boundary pixels (where `i` is `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` is `min_y` or `max_y`) are set to `'+'` and all other pixels are set to `'.'` unless they are `'w'`, in which case they remain unchanged, `j` is not 0 or the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is not `'.'`, the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`**
