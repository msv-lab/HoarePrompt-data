Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\). If `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, after executing the loop, all boundary pixels (where `i` is `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` is `min_y` or `max_y`) are set to `'+'`, and all other pixels are either `'.'` or `'w'`.**
