The code updates `min_x` and `min_y` to the minimum of their current values and the new values `x` and `y`. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, they will remain as variables in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and must have at least one more tuple, `min_x` is `min(min_x, x)`, `min_y` is `min(min_y, y)`, `max_x` is max(`x1`, `x`), `max_y` is max(`y1`, `y`)**
