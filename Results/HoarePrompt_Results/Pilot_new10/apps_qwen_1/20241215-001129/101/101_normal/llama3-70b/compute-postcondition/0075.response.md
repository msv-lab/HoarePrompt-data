Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where all boundary pixels (where `i` is `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` is `min_y` or `max_y`) are set to `'+'` and all other pixels are set to `'.'` unless they are `'w'`, in which case they remain unchanged. If the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`. Otherwise, the pixel at position (`i`, `j`) is set to `'.'`.***
