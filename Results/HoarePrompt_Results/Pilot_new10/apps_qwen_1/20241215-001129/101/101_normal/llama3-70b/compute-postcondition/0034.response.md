Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be less than `m`. If `(i == \text{min\_x} \text{ or } i == \text{max\_x} \text{ or } j == \text{min\_y} \text{ or } (j == \text{max\_y}))` and `pixels[0][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[0][j]` is changed to `+`. Otherwise, if `pixels[0][j]` is `'w'`, no change occurs. Otherwise, `pixels[0][j]` is changed to `'.'`.***
