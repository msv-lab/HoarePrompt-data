Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list, `j` is 2. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y))` and `pixels[1][2]` equals '+', then `pixels[1][2]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `pixels[1][2]` is 'w', the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `pixels[1][2]` is set to '.'.***
