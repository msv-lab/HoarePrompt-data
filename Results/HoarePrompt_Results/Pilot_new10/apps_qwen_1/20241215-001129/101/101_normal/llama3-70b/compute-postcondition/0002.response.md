The code creates a new list `white_pixels` containing tuples `(i, j)` for every index where the character in the `pixels` list at position `(i, j)` is 'w'. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the `pixels` list itself is not modified.

Let's denote the initial state more formally:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of rows.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of columns.
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters.

After executing the code, `white_pixels` will contain all the coordinates `(i, j)` where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows; `m` is an integer representing the number of columns; `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters; `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'.**
