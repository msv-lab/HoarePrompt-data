The `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop body and moves to the next iteration of the loop. It does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `m`, `pixels`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `pixels` is a 2D list, `j` is 0, and the condition `(i != min_x and i != max_x and j != min_y and j != max_y) or pixels[i][j] != '.'` holds true.**
