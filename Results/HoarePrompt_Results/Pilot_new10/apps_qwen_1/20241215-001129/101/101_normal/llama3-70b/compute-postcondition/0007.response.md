According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more tuples in the `white_pixels` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of rows.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of columns.
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters.
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples `(i, j)` where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'.
- `min_x` is `x1`.
- `min_y` is `y1`.
- `max_x` is max(`x1`, `x`).
- `max_y` is max(`y1`, `y`).

At the end of the last iteration, the loop processed one tuple from the `white_pixels` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple left in the `white_pixels` list.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` remains the same since it does not affect the loop condition.
- `m` remains the same since it does not affect the loop condition.
- `pixels` remains the same since it does not affect the loop condition.
- `white_pixels` must have at least one more tuple left.
- `min_x` remains the same since it does not affect the loop condition.
- `min_y` remains the same since it does not affect the loop condition.
- `max_x` remains the same since it does not affect the loop condition.
- `max_y` remains the same since it does not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and must have at least one more tuple, `min_x` is `x1`, `min_y` is `y1`, `max_x` is max(`x1`, `x`), `max_y` is max(`y1`, `y`)**.
