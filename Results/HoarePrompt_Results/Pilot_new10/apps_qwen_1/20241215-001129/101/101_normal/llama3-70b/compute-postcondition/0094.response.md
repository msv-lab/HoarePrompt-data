The code snippet `print(''.join(row))` prints the string representation of the current row in the `pixels` list. This operation does not change the values of any variables; it only outputs a string representation of the current row.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list with at least one row; `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels; `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels; `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`; `row` is the next row in the `pixels` list, printed as a single string by joining its elements; the current row is printed to the console.**
