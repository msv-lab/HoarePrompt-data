The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of the pixel at position `(i, j)` from `'.'` to `'+',` but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, and the structure of `pixels` also remain valid.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `pixels` is a 2D list. `j` is 0. The current value of `i` is either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or the current value of `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`. Additionally, the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` list is now equal to `'+'.**
