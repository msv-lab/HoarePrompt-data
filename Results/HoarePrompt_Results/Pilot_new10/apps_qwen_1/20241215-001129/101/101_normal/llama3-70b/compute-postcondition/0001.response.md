The code initializes a list of lists called `pixels` by reading `n` rows of input, where each row is a string of characters. Each character represents a pixel.

- `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer representing the number of rows.
- `m` remains unchanged and is still an integer representing the number of columns.
- `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters (pixels) read from the input.

Since the exact values of the pixels are not specified, we will refer to them generically as a string of characters within each inner list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows; `m` is an integer representing the number of columns; `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters.**
