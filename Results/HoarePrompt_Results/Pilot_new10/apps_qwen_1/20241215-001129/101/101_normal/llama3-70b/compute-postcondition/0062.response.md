The code assigns the value `'.'` to the element in the 2D list `pixels` at index `[i][j]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the specific element `pixels[1][2]` is set to `'.'`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][2] = '.'`, `j` is 2**
