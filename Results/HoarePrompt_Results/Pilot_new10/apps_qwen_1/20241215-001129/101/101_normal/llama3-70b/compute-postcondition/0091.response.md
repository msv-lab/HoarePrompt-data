To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the loop will modify the state of the `pixels` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers.
   - `pixels` is an `n x m` 2D list.
   - `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are initialized based on the coordinates of white pixels.
   - `frame_size` is calculated as \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each row in `pixels`.
   - For each row, it will check each pixel and update its value based on the given conditions.

3. **Required Adjustments**:
   - The loop will iterate over the rows of the `pixels` list, so `row` should represent a valid row from `pixels`.
   - There are no additional constraints on the values of `i` and `j` within the loop itself; they are determined by the loop structure.
   - The loop does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, or `frame_size` during its execution.

### Final State Adjustment:

Since the loop iterates over the rows of the `pixels` list, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that the loop can access the rows of the `pixels` list. This means that `pixels` should be a valid 2D list with at least one row.

**State:**
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list with at least one row.
- `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels.
- `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels.
- `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels.
- `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels.
- `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list with at least one row, `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\) and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`**.
