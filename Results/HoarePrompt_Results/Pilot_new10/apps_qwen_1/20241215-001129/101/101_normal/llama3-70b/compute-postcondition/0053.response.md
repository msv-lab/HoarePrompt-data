Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `pixels` is a 2D list
   - `j` is 0

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `m-1`.
   - The loop condition is `(i != min_x and i != max_x and j != min_y and j != max_y) or pixels[i][j] != '.'`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 1 (which means `i` is neither `min_x` nor `max_x` as they must be greater than 0)
   - `j` is 0 (which means `j` is `min_y` because it is the first value)

4. **Checking the Loop Condition:**
   - Since `j` is `min_y` (which is 0), the condition `j != min_y` fails, meaning the loop will not execute for `j = 0`.

5. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop does not execute for `j = 0`, `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `i` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `n`, `m`, and the `pixels` list remain the same.

6. **New States for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `pixels` is a 2D list
   - `j` is 1

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list, `j` is 1**
