The code `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console. This operation does not affect any of the existing variables. The `print` function simply outputs `-1`, and then control returns to the program, maintaining the previous states of all variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `min_x` is the smallest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `min_y` is the smallest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_x` is the largest `x` coordinate of all white pixels, `max_y` is the largest `y` coordinate of all white pixels, `frame_size` is \(\max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1\), and the value printed is -1.**
