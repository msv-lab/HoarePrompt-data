Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `pixels` is a 2D list

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

### Loop Body:
For each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`:
- If `j` is such that `(i == \text{min\_x} \text{ or } i == \text{max\_x} \text{ or } j == \text{min\_y} \text{ or } (j == \text{max\_y}))` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is changed to `'+'.`
- If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, it remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `pixels[i][j]` is changed to `'.'`.

### Current Iteration:
- `i` is currently 0.

### What Needs to Change for the Next Iteration:
To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Therefore, `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the next iteration.

### Additional Considerations:
- The value of `n` and `m` remain the same unless modified within the loop.
- The `pixels` list remains the same unless modified within the loop.

### Updated States:
- `i` will be 1.
- `n` and `m` must still be greater than 0.
- `pixels` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `pixels` is a 2D list.**
