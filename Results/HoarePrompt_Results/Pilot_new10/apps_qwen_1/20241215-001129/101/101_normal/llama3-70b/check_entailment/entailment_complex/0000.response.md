Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the monitor and the pixel state using the given input format. This ensures that the initial setup matches the problem description.

2. **Identifying White Pixels:**
   - The program correctly identifies the coordinates of all white pixels using a list comprehension. This step is essential for determining the boundaries of the frame.

3. **Finding Frame Boundaries:**
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels (\( \text{min\_x}, \text{min\_y}, \text{max\_x}, \text{max\_y} \)). These values help in determining the potential frame boundaries.

4. **Calculating Frame Size:**
   - The program computes the size of the smallest possible frame that can enclose all white pixels using the formula \( \text{frame\_size} = \max(\max(\text{max\_x}) - \min(\text{min\_x}), \max(\text{max\_y}) - \min(\text{min\_y})) + 1 \).

5. **Frame Validation:**
   - The program checks if the calculated frame size exceeds the dimensions of the monitor. If it does, it prints \(-1\), indicating that no valid frame exists. This ensures that the frame does not exceed the boundaries of the monitor.

6. **Modifying Pixel Representation:**
   - The program correctly modifies the pixel representation by setting the boundary pixels to `'+ '` and leaving the white pixels as `'w'`. This step ensures that the output matches the problem description.

7. **Handling Multiple Valid Frames:**
   - The program prints any valid frame of the minimum size. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the required frame must have the smallest size.

Given these steps, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
