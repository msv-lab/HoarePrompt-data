To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of rows.
   - `m` is an integer representing the number of columns.
   - `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters.
   - `white_pixels` is a list of tuples \((i, j)\) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and must have at least one more tuple.
   - `min_x` is `min(min_x, x)`.
   - `min_y` is `min(min_y, y)`.
   - `max_x` is `max(max_x, x)`.
   - `max_y` is `max(max_y, y)`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over each tuple \((x, y)\) in `white_pixels`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - The loop has just completed its execution for one of the tuples in `white_pixels`.
   - Therefore, `white_pixels` still contains at least one tuple.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop will execute again if there are more tuples in `white_pixels`, we only need to update the tuple being processed and ensure that `white_pixels` still contains at least one tuple.
   - The values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are updated based on the current tuple \((x, y)\). These values do not change the condition for the loop to continue, but they need to reflect the most recent tuple processed.

5. **Updated States:**
   - The tuple \((x, y)\) has been processed, so we move to the next tuple in `white_pixels`.
   - Ensure that `white_pixels` still has at least one tuple remaining.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `white_pixels` should now contain all tuples except the one that was just processed.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` reflect the most recent tuple processed.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns, `pixels` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains a string of characters, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and must have at least one tuple left, `min_x` is `min(min_x, x)`, `min_y` is `min(min_y, y)`, `max_x` is `max(max_x, x)`, `max_y` is `max(max_y, y)`**
