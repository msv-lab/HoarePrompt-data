Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the smallest possible frame does not completely enclose all white pixels. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
2 6
w..w.w
...w..
```

The expected output should be `-1` because there is no frame of size 1 that can enclose all the white pixels. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output a frame of size 1:

```
w++.w.
+++.++
```

This happens because the program checks if `frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2` and returns `-1` only after constructing the frame, which means it might construct a frame before checking if it fully encloses all white pixels. To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the constructed frame completely encloses all white pixels before returning it.
