Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the required amount of lemonade \( L \) is exactly a power of 2 and there is a more cost-effective way to buy lemonade by combining smaller bottles.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 16
10 20 30 40
```

- According to the problem description, to get exactly 16 liters, the most cost-effective way would be to buy one 16-liter bottle (type 4), which would cost 40 roubles.
- However, the program's approach might consider buying multiple smaller bottles and then combining them, leading to a higher cost.

For example, the program might consider buying one 8-liter bottle (type 3) and one 8-liter bottle (type 3) again, costing 60 roubles, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not always find the minimum cost to meet the requirement of \( L \) liters of lemonade.
