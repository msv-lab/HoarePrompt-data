Output State: **`dp[i]` is the minimum value between the original value of `dp[i]` and `c[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `c[i]` remains unchanged for all `0 ≤ i < n`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: Initially, `dp` is a list of 31 elements, each set to 10, and `c` is a list of 31 elements, where the first `n` elements are the same as `costs` and the remaining `31 - n` elements are all 10.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
  - For each iteration, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `c[i]`.
  - Since `dp` and `c` are only updated within the bounds `0 ≤ i < n`, and the loop runs exactly `n` times (as long as `n > 0`), every element in `dp` up to index `n-1` will be updated according to the corresponding `c[i]`.

### Conclusion:
After the loop completes all its iterations, `dp[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n` will be the minimum of the original value of `dp[i]` and `c[i]`. The values of `c[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n` remain unchanged, and `dp` and `c` beyond index `n-1` remain as initialized.

Thus, the final state is:
Output State: **`dp[i]` is the minimum value between the original value of `dp[i]` and `c[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `c[i]` remains unchanged for all `0 ≤ i < n`.**
