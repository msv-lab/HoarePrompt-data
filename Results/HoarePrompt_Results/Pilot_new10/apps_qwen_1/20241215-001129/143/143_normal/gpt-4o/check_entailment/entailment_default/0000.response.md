Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the binary search-like strategy to minimize the cost of purchasing at least \( L \) liters of lemonade. The function `func_1` does not properly handle the selection of the most cost-effective way to buy the required amount of lemonade.

Here are some issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized to a very large value (`10^18`) and updated incorrectly. The initial values for `dp` should reflect the cost of buying each possible amount of lemonade up to \( L \).

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic in the nested loops is incorrect. The `dp` table should be updated based on the minimum cost of buying the required amount of lemonade using the available bottle sizes.

3. **Final Cost Calculation**: The final cost calculation logic is flawed. It assumes that the optimal solution can be found by simply iterating from the largest bottle size to the smallest and subtracting the largest possible volume that fits into \( L \). This approach does not guarantee the minimum cost.

To fix these issues, a correct implementation would involve a more sophisticated dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy to select the most cost-effective bottles.

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3 10
5 10 15
```

**Expected Output:**
```
15
```

However, the provided code might not handle this correctly due to the flawed logic in the dynamic programming table updates and the final cost calculation.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
