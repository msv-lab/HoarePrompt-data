The code updates `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] * 2`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means the code is updating `dp[1]` to be the minimum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0] * 2`.

Since `dp[0]` is the minimum value between its original value and `c[0]`, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `c[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `dp[0]` is the smallest value among `c[0]` to `c[n-1]`.

Therefore, `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], dp[0] * 2)`, which means `dp[1]` is now the minimum of its original value and `dp[0] * 2`.

The initial conditions remain valid, meaning `c[i]` remains unchanged for all `0 ≤ i < n`, and `dp[i]` is still the minimum value between the original value of `dp[i]` and `c[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, but now specifically for `i = 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `c[i]` remains unchanged for all `0 ≤ i < n`, and `dp[1]` is the minimum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0] * 2`, and `dp[i]` is the minimum value between the original value of `dp[i]` and `c[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n`**
