`L` is decreased by \(2^{29}\). The initial value of `i` is 29, so \(1 << i\) is equivalent to \(2^{29}\). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is 29; `current_cost` is `current_cost + dp[29]`; `answer` is the same as before; `L` is `L - 2^{29}`.**
