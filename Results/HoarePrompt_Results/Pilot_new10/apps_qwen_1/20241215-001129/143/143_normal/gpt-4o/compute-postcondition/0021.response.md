`current_cost` is incremented by `dp[i]`. The value of `i` remains 30 because the code does not change its value. The precondition that `i` must remain greater than or equal to 0 is still valid. The length `L` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 30, `current_cost` is increased by `dp[30]`, `L` is greater than or equal to 2^30**
