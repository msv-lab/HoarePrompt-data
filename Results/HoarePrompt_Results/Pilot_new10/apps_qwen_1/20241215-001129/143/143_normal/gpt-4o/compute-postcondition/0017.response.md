The code `answer = max_cost` simply assigns the value of `max_cost` to the variable `answer`. No other changes are made to the variables `i` or `c[i]`. The variable `dp` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the only new variable introduced is `answer`, which is assigned the value of `max_cost`.

Output State: **`i` is 30, `c[i]` remains unchanged for all \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp[i]` for each \(1 \leq i \leq 30\) is the minimum value between the original value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1] * 2`, `answer` is equal to `max_cost`**
