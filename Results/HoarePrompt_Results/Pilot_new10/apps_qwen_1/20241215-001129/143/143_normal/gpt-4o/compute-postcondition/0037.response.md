The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `L`, and `costs`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30.
- `L` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9.
- `costs` is a list of n positive integers where each element represents the cost of a bottle of lemonade of a specific type, with 1 ≤ costs[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

The function returns `answer`, which is the minimum value between `current_cost` and `dp[0]` since `L` is 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `L`, and `costs`, and returns the minimum value between `current_cost` and `dp[0]` when `L` is 0.**
