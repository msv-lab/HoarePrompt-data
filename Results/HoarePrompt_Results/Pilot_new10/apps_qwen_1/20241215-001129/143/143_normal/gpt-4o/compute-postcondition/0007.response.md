According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `c[i_prev + 1]`, and `c[i]` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote it as `i_end`. For the loop to continue, `i_end < n` must hold true. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `n`.

State: **`dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `c[i_prev + 1]`, `c[i]` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`**
