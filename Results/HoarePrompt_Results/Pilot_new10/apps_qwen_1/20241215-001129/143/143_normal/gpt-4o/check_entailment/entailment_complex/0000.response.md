Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed explanation of why it works as intended:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into components. It correctly assigns the values to `n` (number of types of bottles), `L` (required liters of lemonade), and `costs` (a list of costs for each type of bottle).

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to a very large value (`10 ** 18`), ensuring that any valid cost will be smaller.
   - The `dp` array is populated with the initial costs, and then adjusted to ensure that the minimum cost is recorded for each bottle type.

3. **DP Table Update**:
   - The program iterates through possible bottle types up to 30 (since the largest bottle size is \(2^{30} - 1\)). For each type, it updates the `dp` array to reflect the minimum cost of obtaining any amount of lemonade up to \(2^i\) liters.
   - Specifically, `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and twice the value of `dp[i-1]`. This ensures that the cost of obtaining any amount of lemonade up to \(2^i\) liters is the minimum possible.

4. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates backward from the largest possible bottle size (30) to 0, determining the minimum cost needed to obtain at least `L` liters of lemonade.
   - It keeps track of the current cost (`current_cost`) and adjusts `L` accordingly. If the remaining `L` is greater than or equal to \(2^i\), it adds the cost of buying a bottle of size \(2^i\) to `current_cost` and subtracts \(2^i\) from `L`.
   - The final result is the minimum cost found, ensuring that the cost is as low as possible while meeting the requirement of `L` liters.

5. **Correct Output**:
   - The function returns the computed minimum cost, which matches the problem statement’s requirement.

Given the detailed steps and the logical flow of the program, it accurately solves the problem as described, handling all edge cases and providing the correct output for any valid input within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
