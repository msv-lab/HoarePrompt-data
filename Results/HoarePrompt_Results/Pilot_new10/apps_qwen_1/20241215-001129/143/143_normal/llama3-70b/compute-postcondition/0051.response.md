The function `func` accepts a parameter `c`, which is a list of `n` integers. Each element `c_i` in the list `c` is an integer such that `1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9`. The function also accepts two integer parameters `n` and `L` such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 30` and `1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9`. 

Case_1: If the sum of all elements in the list `c` is less than or equal to `L`, the function returns the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
Case_2: If the sum of all elements in the list `c` is greater than `L`, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `c` of `n` integers, along with integers `n` and `L`, and return the sum of all elements in the list `c` if the sum is less than or equal to `L`, otherwise it returns -1.
