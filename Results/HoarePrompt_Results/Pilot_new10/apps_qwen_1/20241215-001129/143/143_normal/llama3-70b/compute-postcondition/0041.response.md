The code `vol = 2 ** j - 1` updates the value of `vol`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, `vol` is 2, and `j` is 3, we calculate the new value of `vol` as follows:

- `2 ** j` is `2 ** 3`, which equals 8.
- Subtracting 1 from 8 gives us 7.

Therefore, the new value of `vol` is 7. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `vol` is 7, `j` is 3**
