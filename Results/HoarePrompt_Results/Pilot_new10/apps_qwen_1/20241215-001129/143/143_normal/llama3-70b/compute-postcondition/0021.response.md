The code assigns the value `2 ** j - 1` to the variable `vol`. This means `vol` is calculated based on the current value of `j`. The variables `i`, `L`, `n`, and `dp[i]` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the variable `vol`.

Output State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[i]` is defined, `vol` is `2 ** j - 1`**
