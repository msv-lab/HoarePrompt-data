To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and the current state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `vol` is 7
   - `j` is 3
   - The condition for updating `dp[i]` is `if vol <= i: ...`. Given `vol` (7) is greater than `i` (2), the condition is false, so `dp[i]` is not updated.
   - Since the condition is not met, the state of the program remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is iterating over `j` with `for j in range(n)`.
   - This means `j` will increment by 1 at each iteration until it reaches `n`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - `j` is currently 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 4.
   - Therefore, the only state that changes is `j`.

### Updated State:
- `i` remains 2.
- `vol` remains 7.
- `j` becomes 4.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `vol` is 7, `j` is 4**
