Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `L + 1`
   - `L` is a positive integer
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `dp[i]` is defined and updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]`
   - `vol` is 2

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over `j` in the range of `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - The variable `i` remains unchanged because the loop itself does not directly modify `i`.
   - The variable `vol` remains unchanged as well.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` should still be `L + 1` because it was not modified within the loop.
   - `L` is a positive integer and does not change.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `dp[i]` will be updated again, but we do not need to explicitly state this as the update condition is given.
   - `vol` remains 2.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from the previous value, so if the previous `j` was `j_end`, the next `j` will be `j_end + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `j_end + 1` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[i]` is defined and updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]`, `j` is `j_end + 1`, `vol` is 2**
