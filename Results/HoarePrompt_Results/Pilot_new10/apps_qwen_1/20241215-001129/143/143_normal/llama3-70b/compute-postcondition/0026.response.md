The code changes the value of `vol` to `2 ** j - 1`. Given that `j` is defined as `j_end + 1`, we substitute this into the equation. However, since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `j_end`, we keep it in the form of `j_end + 1`.

- The value of `i` remains `L + 1`.
- The value of `L` remains a positive integer.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- The expression `dp[i]` is the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]`, which remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` is `j_end + 1`, and `vol` is updated to `2 ** (j_end + 1) - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[i]` is defined and updated to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]`, `j` is `j_end + 1`, `vol` is `2 ** (j_end + 1) - 1`**
