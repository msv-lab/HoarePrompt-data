The code updates `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`. Given that `i` is `L + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]` where `j` is `1` and `vol` is `1`.

- `i` is `L + 1`
- `vol` is `1`
- `j` is `1`

So, the update rule becomes:
\[ dp[i] = \min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + costs[1]) \]

Given the initial state where `dp[i]` is updated based on this rule, we know `dp[i]` now depends on `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`, `vol` is `1`, `j` is `1`**
