Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is assigned the first integer from input.
- `L` is assigned the second integer from input.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers.
- `costs` is a list of `L` integers assigned from the second input.
- `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where the first element is `0` and all other elements are `float('inf')`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, L + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` as `1` (since `range(1, L + 1)` starts at `1`).
   - The loop will continue until `i` reaches `L + 1`.
   
2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `1 <= i < L + 1`, which means the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i = L`.

3. **Dependencies for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop requires that `i` should incrementally increase from `1` up to `L`.
   - Since `i` starts at `1`, the initial value of `i` must be `1`.
   - `L` must be a positive integer greater than `0` to ensure the loop runs at least once.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The values of `n`, `c`, `costs`, and `dp` do not directly affect the loop execution, but they are necessary for the correct operation of the loop body. Therefore, we do not need to adjust these values for the loop to start executing.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustments needed for the loop to execute are setting `i` to `1` and ensuring that `L` is a positive integer.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `L` must be a positive integer**
