The code initializes a list `dp` with length `L + 1`, where each element is set to infinity (`float('inf')`). The variables `n`, `L`, `c`, and `costs` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the `dp` list.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the first integer from input, `L` is assigned the second integer from input, `c` is a list of n integers, `costs` is a list of L integers assigned from the second input, `dp` is a list of length `L + 1` where each element is `float('inf')`**
