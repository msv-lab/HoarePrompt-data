Postcondition: ***`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `dp[i]` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + costs[j]` where `j` is `j_end + 1`, `vol` is `2`, since the if condition `vol <= i` is always true given the precondition `i = L + 1` and `vol = 2`.***
