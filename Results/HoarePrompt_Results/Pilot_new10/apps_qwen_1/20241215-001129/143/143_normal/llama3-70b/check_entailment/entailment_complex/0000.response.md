Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( L \) from the input, followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the costs of the bottles. This matches the problem description perfectly.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost to achieve exactly \( L \) liters of lemonade. It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to get exactly \( i \) liters of lemonade. It then iterates through all possible volumes of bottles and updates the DP array accordingly. This ensures that it finds the minimum cost for any given \( L \).

3. **Output**: The program outputs the minimum cost found by the DP approach. If no valid combination of bottles can achieve exactly \( L \) liters, it outputs -1, which is also in line with the problem description.

4. **Constraints**: The program handles the constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 30 \) and \( 1 \leq L \leq 10^9 \) efficiently, ensuring that the solution is both feasible and within the expected time complexity for dynamic programming problems of this nature.

Since the program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
