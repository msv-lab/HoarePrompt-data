Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a dynamic programming solution to solve the problem correctly. It initializes a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to obtain exactly `i` liters of lemonade. For each volume `vol` from 1 to `L`, it updates the DP array by considering the cost of adding a bottle of that volume. The final result is `dp[L]`, which gives the minimum cost to obtain at least `L` liters of lemonade. The code handles all given examples correctly and follows the problem description for every potential case within the constraints provided.
