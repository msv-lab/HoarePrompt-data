Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two integer inputs `n` and `L` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 30\) and \(1 \leq L \leq 10^9\)), and a list `costs` of `n` integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)). It uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to fill a knapsack of size `L` using subsets of the given costs. If it is possible to achieve the exact size `L`, it returns the minimum cost; otherwise, it returns -1.**
