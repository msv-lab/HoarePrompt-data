According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `L` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 1, `vol` is 1, `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], costs[1])`, and `j` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `n` is at least 1, we need to increment `j` by 1 so that it becomes 2. This way, the condition `j < n` will still be true, allowing the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 1, `L` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 1, `vol` is 1, `dp[1]` is updated to `min(dp[1], costs[1])`, and `j` is 2.**
