To solve this task, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = L`. Each iteration updates `dp[i]` until `vol` exceeds `i`.

2. **Identify Key Variables**: The key variables here are `i` and `L`. The loop continues to update `dp[i]` as long as `vol` does not exceed `i`.

3. **Current State**: We know the following from the end of the previous iteration:
   - The loop is currently at some value of `i`.
   - `vol` has not yet exceeded `i` (since if it had, the loop would have stopped).

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` until `vol` exceeds `i`, we need to determine the new value of `i` and ensure `vol` does not exceed this new value.

5. **Determine New State**:
   - If the loop was at `i` during the previous iteration, the next iteration will start at `i + 1`.
   - `vol` must still not exceed this new value of `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is increased by 1.
- `vol` must still not exceed `i + 1`.

Let's summarize the answer:

State: **`i` is 2, `vol` must be less than 2**.

(Note: Assuming the previous value of `i` was 1, then the next iteration starts with `i = 2`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `vol` must be less than `i + 1`, which is `2` in this case.)
