`costs` is assigned the values from the input split into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `costs` will be a list of integers, and the length of this list will be equal to `L`, which was previously input. The values in `costs` will be the integers provided in the second input. The initial values of `n` and `L` and the list `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the first integer from input, `L` is assigned the second integer from input, `c` is a list of n integers where each `c_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9, `costs` is a list of L integers assigned from the second input**
