`n` and `L` are assigned the values from `input().split()`. Since the input is split into two parts, `n` is assigned the first integer and `L` is assigned the second integer. The list `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is assigned the first integer from input, `L` is assigned the second integer from input, and `c` is a list of n integers where each `c_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the first integer from input, `L` is assigned the second integer from input, and `c` is a list of n integers where each `c_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9.**
