The code `x, y, z = map(float, input().split())` takes three space-separated floating-point numbers as input and assigns them to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, and their values range from 0.1 to 200.0. After executing the code, these values will be updated based on the user's input.

Let's denote the input values as `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are the specific floating-point numbers provided by the user. After the input, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, 0.1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 200.0**
