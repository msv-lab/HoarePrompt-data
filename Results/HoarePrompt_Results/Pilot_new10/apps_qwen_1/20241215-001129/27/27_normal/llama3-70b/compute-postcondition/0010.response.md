The code snippet `a10 = z ** y ** x` calculates `a10` as `c ** b ** a`. Given the initial state where `x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, and `z` is `c`, the value of `a10` is calculated as `c ** b ** a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `a1` is `a`, `a2` is `a`, `a4` is `(a`, `a6` is `b`, `a7` is `(b`, `a8` is `(b`, `a9` is `c`, `a10` is `c ** b ** a**
