Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and calculates 12 different exponentiation expressions involving three real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). It then prints the expression corresponding to the maximum value among these calculations. **

Explanation:
- The function reads three real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) from the user input, where each number has exactly one digit after the decimal point and lies between 0.1 and 200.0.
- It computes 12 different forms of exponentiation using these three numbers.
- Finally, it finds the maximum value among these 12 computed values and prints the corresponding expression from the list of expressions.

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., real numbers with one decimal place in the range 0.1 to 200.0). There is no validation for these assumptions.
- The function does not handle any potential exceptions that might arise during input parsing or arithmetic operations. For example, if the input cannot be parsed as a float, the function would fail.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where all 12 computed values are the same. In such a case, the printed expression will be arbitrary due to the nature of the `max()` function and the `index()` method used.
