`a11` is assigned the value of `z` raised to the power of `x`, and then the result is raised to the power of `y`. Given that `z` is `c`, `x` is `a`, and `y` is `b`, we can calculate `a11` as follows:

1. First, calculate `c ** a`.
2. Then, raise the result of `c ** a` to the power of `b`.

Since `c` is `c`, `a` is `a`, and `b` is `b`, the value of `a11` is `c ** (a ** b)`.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `b`, `z` is `c`, `a1` is `a`, `a2` is `a`, `a4` is `(a`, `a6` is `b`, `a7` is `(b`, `a8` is `(b`, `a9` is `c`, `a10` is `c`, `a11` is `c ** (a ** b)**
