The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to handle real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` with exactly one digit after the decimal point, where `0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0`, but since these constraints are not applied within the function body, we only need to describe the return value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on the internal logic of the function.**
