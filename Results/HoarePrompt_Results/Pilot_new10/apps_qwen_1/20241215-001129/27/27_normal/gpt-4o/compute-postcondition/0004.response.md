The code `print(max_expr)` prints the pair from `expressions` with the maximum first element. However, the values of `max_expr` and the contents of `expressions` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is in the action taken by the code, which is printing the pair with the maximum first element.

Output State: **`x` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number with exactly one digit after the decimal point, `expressions` is a list of pairs, `max_value` is the maximum first element of the pairs in `expressions`, `max_expr` is the pair from `expressions` with the maximum first element; print(max_expr)**
