The function `func_1` reads three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` from standard input, where each number has exactly one digit after the decimal point and lies in the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. It then evaluates twelve different mathematical expressions involving exponentiation and compares them to find the maximum value. Finally, it prints the expression corresponding to the maximum value found.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The function does not accept any parameters.
2. It reads three real numbers from standard input.
3. These numbers are converted to floats.
4. It constructs a list of twelve tuples, each containing an evaluated mathematical expression and its string representation.
5. It finds the tuple with the maximum value from the list.
6. It prints the string representation of the expression with the maximum value.

There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not contain any missing functionality. Therefore, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function reads three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` from standard input, evaluates twelve different mathematical expressions involving exponentiation, and prints the string representation of the expression with the maximum value.**
