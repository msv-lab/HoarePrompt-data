The code creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the result of different mathematical expressions involving the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, and also includes a string representation of each expression. However, the actual values of `x`, `y`, and `z` do not change during this process. The expressions themselves are stored in the list, but no assignments are made to `x`, `y`, or `z`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state: `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, and they lie in the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point, and they lie in the range 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive.**
