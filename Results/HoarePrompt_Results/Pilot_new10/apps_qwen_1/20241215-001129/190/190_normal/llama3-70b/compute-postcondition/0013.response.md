Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`, `cost` is updated to the new sum of the minimum absolute differences, `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is now equal to `cost` and `min_t` is equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.***
