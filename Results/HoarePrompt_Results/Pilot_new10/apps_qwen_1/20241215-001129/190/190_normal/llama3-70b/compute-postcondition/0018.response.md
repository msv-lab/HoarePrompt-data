Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks` and must be greater than 0, `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and its adjacent elements, `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to `cost`; otherwise, `min_cost` remains unchanged.***
