The code `print(min_t, min_cost)` simply prints the values of `min_t` and `min_cost`. It does not change the values of any variables; it only outputs them. Therefore, the values of `min_t` and `min_cost` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the value that minimizes the cost in the range `[mid + 1, 100]`, `min_cost` is the minimum possible sum of the minimum absolute differences for any `i` in the range, and `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum cost, and the values of `min_t` and `min_cost` are printed.**
