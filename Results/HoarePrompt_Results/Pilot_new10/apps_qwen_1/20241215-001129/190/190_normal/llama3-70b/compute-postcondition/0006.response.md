The code assigns the current value of `cost` to `min_cost`. This means `min_cost` is now holding the same value as `cost`. The other variables (`n`, `sticks`, `mid`, `t`, and `cost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`, `cost` is the sum of `abs(x - mid)` for each `x` in `sticks`, `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`**
