The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n // 2 + 1`. The values of `cost` and `min_cost` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (n // 2 + 1)), abs(x - n // 2))` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_cost` is equal to the current value of `cost`, `min_t` is `i`**
