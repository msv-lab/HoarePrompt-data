`min_cost` is assigned the value of `cost`. The value of `cost` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (n // 2 + 1)), abs(x - n // 2))` for each `x` in `sticks`, and `min_cost` is now equal to the current value of `cost`.

Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `cost` is the sum of `min(abs(x - (n // 2 + 1)), abs(x - n // 2))` for each `x` in `sticks`, `min_cost` is equal to the current value of `cost`**
