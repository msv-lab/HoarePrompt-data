`t` is assigned the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`. The values of `n`, `sticks`, and `cost` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`, `cost` is the sum of `abs(x - mid)` for each `x` in `sticks`, `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`**
