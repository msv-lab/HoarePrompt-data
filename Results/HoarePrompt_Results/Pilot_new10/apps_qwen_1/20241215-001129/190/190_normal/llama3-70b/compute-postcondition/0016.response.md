The line `min_cost = cost` assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. The variables `n`, `sticks`, `mid`, and `t` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the `min_cost` variable now holds the value of `cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `sticks` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mid` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks` and must be greater than 0, `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in `sticks` and its adjacent elements, `t` is the element at index `n // 2` in the list `sticks`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`**
