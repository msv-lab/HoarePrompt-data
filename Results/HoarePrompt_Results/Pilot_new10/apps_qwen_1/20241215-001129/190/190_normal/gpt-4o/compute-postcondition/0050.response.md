Postcondition: **`a` is an empty list, `current_cost` is the final cost calculated based on the lengths of elements in `a` following the given conditions, `min_cost` is the minimum `current_cost` encountered during the loop execution, `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost`, `t` is the final value of `t` after the loop execution, and `current_cost` is the final cost calculated. The current value of `current_cost` is lower than `min_cost`.**
