`min_cost` is assigned the value of `current_cost`. Since `current_cost` is less than `min_cost` in the initial state, `min_cost` will take the value of `current_cost`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made according to the conditions in the loop, `min_cost` is the value of `current_cost`, and `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` if any, otherwise it is 99.**
