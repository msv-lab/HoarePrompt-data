The function `func` accepts two inputs: an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, and a list `a` containing `n` integers where each integer represents the length of a stick. The function iterates over possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 to find the value of `t` that minimizes the cost of cutting the sticks. The cost is calculated based on the differences between the stick lengths and the value of `t`.

Hereâ€™s the detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. The function first reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the standard input.
2. It initializes `min_cost` to infinity and `best_t` to -1.
3. It then iterates over possible values of `t` from 1 to 100.
4. For each `t`, it calculates `current_cost` by iterating through each stick length in `a`. If a stick length is less than `t - 1`, it adds the difference `(t - 1) - length` to `current_cost`. If a stick length is more than `t + 1`, it adds the difference `length - (t + 1)` to `current_cost`.
5. After calculating `current_cost` for each `t`, it updates `min_cost` and `best_t` if `current_cost` is smaller than the previous `min_cost`.
6. Finally, it prints the `best_t` and `min_cost`.

Considering the annotations and the code, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, representing the lengths of sticks. It finds the optimal value of `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)) that minimizes the cost of cutting the sticks such that the cost is the sum of the differences between the stick lengths and the closest multiple of `t`. The function then prints the optimal `t` and the corresponding minimum cost.**
