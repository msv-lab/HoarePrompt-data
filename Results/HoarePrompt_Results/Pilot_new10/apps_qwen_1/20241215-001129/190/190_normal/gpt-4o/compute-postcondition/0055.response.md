The code sets `current_cost` to 0, which initializes it to this value. The other variables (`a`, `min_cost`, `t`, and `best_t`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` is the minimum cost encountered, `t` is 99, and `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` (which is equal to `t` if the if condition is true)**
