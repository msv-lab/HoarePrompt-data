The line `best_t = t` assigns the current value of `t` to `best_t`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `t`, we cannot determine the exact value of `best_t` after this assignment. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made according to the conditions in the loop, `min_cost` is the value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is equal to `t`, and `best_t` is 99 if no value of `t` resulted in a lower `current_cost` previously.**
