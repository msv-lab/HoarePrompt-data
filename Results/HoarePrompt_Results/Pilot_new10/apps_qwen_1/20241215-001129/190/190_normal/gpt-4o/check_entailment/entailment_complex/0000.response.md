Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, representing the lengths of the sticks. This matches the input specification.

2. **Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - For each possible value of `t` from 1 to 100, the program calculates the cost of making all sticks' lengths almost good for `t`. The cost is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each stick's length and the nearest multiple of `t` within the range `[t-1, t+1]`.
   - Specifically, if a stick's length `length` is less than `t-1`, the cost is added as `(t-1) - length`. If `length` is greater than `t+1`, the cost is added as `length - (t+1)`.

3. **Optimization**:
   - The program keeps track of the minimum cost (`min_cost`) and the corresponding `t` (`best_t`) that results in this minimum cost.
   - After iterating through all possible values of `t`, the program prints the optimal `t` and the minimum cost.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the value of `t` and the minimum possible cost, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

The program does not have any logical errors or missing parts that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as specified in the problem statement.
