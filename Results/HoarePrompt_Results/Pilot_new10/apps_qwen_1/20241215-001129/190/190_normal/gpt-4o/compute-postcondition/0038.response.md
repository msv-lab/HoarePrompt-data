Postcondition: **`a` contains at least one element, and `current_cost` is updated as follows: if the length of `a` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, and specifically greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is increased by `length - (t + 1)`. Otherwise, the length of `a` remains unchanged and `current_cost` does not change.**
