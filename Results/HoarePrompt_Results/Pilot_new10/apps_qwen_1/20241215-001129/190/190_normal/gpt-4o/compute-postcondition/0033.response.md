`current_cost` is incremented by the value of `t - 1 - length`. Given the initial state where `a` contains at least one element and the length of `a` is less than `t - 1`, the length of `a` is represented as `length`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its current value.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, the length of `a` is less than `t - 1`; `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its current value.**
