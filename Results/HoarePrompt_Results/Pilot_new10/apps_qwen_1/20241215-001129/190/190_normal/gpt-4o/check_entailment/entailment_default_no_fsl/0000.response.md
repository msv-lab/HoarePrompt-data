Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over all possible values of \( t \) from 1 to 100, calculates the cost of making all stick lengths almost good for each \( t \), and keeps track of the minimum cost and corresponding \( t \). This approach ensures that the program considers all potential values of \( t \) and selects the one with the minimum cost, which aligns with the problem requirements. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints, ensuring it meets the problem description for every case.
