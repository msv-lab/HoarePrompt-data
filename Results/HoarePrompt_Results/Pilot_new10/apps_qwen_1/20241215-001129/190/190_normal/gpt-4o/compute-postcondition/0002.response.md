The code initializes `min_cost` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not affect the values of `n` or `a`, but it sets `min_cost` to a specific value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `min_cost` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`)**
