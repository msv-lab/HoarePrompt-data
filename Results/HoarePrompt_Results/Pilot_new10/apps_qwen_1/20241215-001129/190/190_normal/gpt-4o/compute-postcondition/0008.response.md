`current_cost` is incremented by the value of `t - 1 - length`. The initial state tells us that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, and the length of the list `a` is less than `t - 1`. The length of the list `a` is stored in the variable `length`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the only affected variable is `current_cost`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, the length of the list `a` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`**
