`current_cost` is updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to its current value. The value of `length` is the next element in the list `a`, but since the exact value of `length` and `t` is not specified, we can represent the updated `current_cost` as `current_cost + length - (t + 1)`. The state of `length` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `length` is the next element in the list `a` is still valid.

Output State: **`current_cost` is `current_cost + length - (t + 1)`, `length` is the next element in the list `a`**
