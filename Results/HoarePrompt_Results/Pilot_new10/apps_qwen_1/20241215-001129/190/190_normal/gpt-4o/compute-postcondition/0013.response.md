Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element. If the length of `a` is less than `t - 1`, `current_cost` is increased by `t - 1 - length`. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to `t - 1`, `current_cost` is increased by either `0` (if the length is exactly `t - 1`) or `length - (t + 1)` (if the length is greater than `t + 1`).**
