Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `current_cost` is the sum of all adjustments made according to the conditions in the loop, `min_cost` is the minimum value of `current_cost` encountered during the loop, and `best_t` is the value of `t` that gave the minimum `current_cost` if any, otherwise it is 99. The current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
