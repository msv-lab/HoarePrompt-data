Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal value of \( t \) and the minimum cost to make all stick lengths almost good for \( t \). Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation**: The program starts by calculating the median of the sorted stick lengths as a potential \( t \). This choice of \( t \) ensures that half of the sticks are exactly equal to \( t \) and the other half are either \( t-1 \) or \( t+1 \), minimizing the initial cost.
   
2. **Cost Minimization Search**: The program then searches for the optimal \( t \) by checking values just below and above the median, ensuring that the cost is minimized. For each candidate \( t \), it calculates the total cost of making all sticks almost good for that \( t \).

3. **Correct Handling of Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases by iterating through a reasonable range of potential \( t \) values (from 1 to 100) and choosing the one with the minimum cost.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the chosen \( t \) and the corresponding minimum cost, which matches the required output format.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the solution for the described problem and handles all potential cases effectively. Therefore, the program is correct.
