Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always generate valid points that form a triangle with the required area. Specifically, the code fails to handle cases where the calculated area is not an integer. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Area Calculation and Integer Check**: The code correctly checks if the area `n * m / k` is an integer. If it is not, it prints "NO". However, this check alone is insufficient because the area being an integer is necessary but not sufficient to ensure the existence of valid points forming the triangle.

2. **Triangle Formation**: The code attempts to form a triangle based on the area being an integer. However, it does not handle all possible integer areas correctly. For example, consider the input `n = 4`, `m = 4`, and `k = 3`. The area would be `16 / 3`, which is not an integer, so the code correctly prints "NO". However, for `n = 6`, `m = 3`, and `k = 5`, the area is `18 / 5 = 3.6`, which is not an integer, so the code again prints "NO". But for `n = 6`, `m = 3`, and `k = 4`, the area is `18 / 4 = 4.5`, which is not an integer, yet the code incorrectly proceeds to form a triangle.

3. **Triangle Point Calculation**: Even when the area is an integer, the method used to generate the points is flawed. For instance, if `2 * area <= n` or `2 * area <= m`, the code generates points that do not necessarily form a triangle with the required area. The points are chosen in a way that may not satisfy the triangle inequality.

To illustrate, consider the case `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 4`. The area should be `12 / 4 = 3`. The code attempts to generate points, but it might generate points that do not form a valid triangle with area 3. Specifically, the points `(0, 0)`, `(6, 1)`, and `(0, 1)` do not form a triangle with area 3 because the area calculation using the determinant method would not match the required area.

Thus, the code fails to handle all potential cases correctly and hence the correctness is **False**.
