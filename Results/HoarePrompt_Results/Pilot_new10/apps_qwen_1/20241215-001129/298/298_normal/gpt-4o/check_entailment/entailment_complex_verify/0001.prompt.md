You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        print('NO')
    else:
        area = int(area)
        if area == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if 2 * area <= n:
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            elif 2 * area <= m:
                print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                print(f'1 0')
            else:
                print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                print(f'0 {m // 2}')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `area` is an integer but cannot form a valid triangle with the given constraints. Specifically, consider the input:

```
4 4 2
```

For this input:
- \( n = 4 \)
- \( m = 4 \)
- \( k = 2 \)

The required area of the triangle is \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{2} = 8\), which is an integer. However, it is impossible to form a triangle with area 8 using points within the bounds \(0 \le x_i \le 4\) and \(0 \le y_i \le 4\). The maximum possible area of a triangle within these bounds is 8 (for example, a triangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((4,4)\), and \((0,4)\)), but forming such a triangle requires specific coordinates that are not trivially generated by the current logic.

The current implementation only checks if the area is an integer and tries to place points based on a heuristic that may not always result in a valid triangle. It does not exhaustively check all possible configurations to ensure a valid triangle can always be formed. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. If `2 * area <= m`, the output is `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'`. Otherwise, `m` is halved (`m // 2`), and the output is `'0 0'`. Both conditions `2 * area > n` and `2 * area > m` must still hold true after the execution of the if-else block.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. The output depends on the following conditions:
            #- If `2 * area <= n`, the output is `'0 1'`.
            #- If `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`, the output is `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'`.
            #- If `2 * area > m`, `m` is halved (`m // 2`), and the output is `'0 0'`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. The final state of the program is as follows:
        #- If `area` equals 0, the output is determined by the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
        #- If `area` is not 0, the output is:
        #  - `'0 1'` if `2 * area <= n`.
        #  - `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'` if `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`.
        #  - `'0 0'` if `2 * area > m` and `m` is halved (`m // 2`).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, and `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. The overall state of the program is as follows:
    #- If `area` is not an integer, the console prints 'NO'.
    #- If `area` equals 0, the output is determined by the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
    #- If `area` is not 0:
    #  - `'0 1'` if `2 * area <= n`.
    #  - `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'` if `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`.
    #  - `'0 0'` if `2 * area > m` and `m` is halved (`m // 2`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the standard input. It calculates the area as `n * m / k` and checks if this area is an integer. If the area is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If the area is zero, it also prints 'NO'. Depending on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, it prints one of the following outputs:

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
