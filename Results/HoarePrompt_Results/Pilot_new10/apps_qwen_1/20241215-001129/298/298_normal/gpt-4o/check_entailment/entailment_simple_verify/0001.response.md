Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code reveals that the program does not always generate a valid triangle when the area is an integer. Specifically, the program only checks if `2 * area <= n` or `2 * area <= m` and then attempts to generate points based on these conditions. However, this approach does not guarantee that a valid triangle can always be formed. For example, in the case where \( n = 4 \), \( m = 4 \), and \( k = 2 \), the required area is 8, but the program does not handle the scenario where neither condition `2 * area <= n` nor `2 * area <= m` is met, leading to an incorrect solution. The program needs to exhaustively check all possible configurations to ensure a valid triangle can always be formed, which it currently does not do.
