You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.

Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

If there are no such points, print "NO".

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 3

Output
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

Input
4 4 7

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below:  [Image] 

In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    area = n * m / k
    if (area != int(area)) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        area = int(area)
        if (area == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            print('YES')
            print('0 0')
            if (2 * area <= n) :
                print(f'{2 * area} 1')
                print(f'0 1')
            else :
                if (2 * area <= m) :
                    print(f'1 {2 * area}')
                    print(f'1 0')
                else :
                    print(f'{n} {m // 2}')
                    print(f'0 {m // 2}')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. If `2 * area <= m`, the output is `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'`. Otherwise, `m` is halved (`m // 2`), and the output is `'0 0'`. Both conditions `2 * area > n` and `2 * area > m` must still hold true after the execution of the if-else block.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. The output depends on the following conditions:
            #- If `2 * area <= n`, the output is `'0 1'`.
            #- If `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`, the output is `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'`.
            #- If `2 * area > m`, `m` is halved (`m // 2`), and the output is `'0 0'`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. The final state of the program is as follows:
        #- If `area` equals 0, the output is determined by the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
        #- If `area` is not 0, the output is:
        #  - `'0 1'` if `2 * area <= n`.
        #  - `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'` if `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`.
        #  - `'0 0'` if `2 * area > m` and `m` is halved (`m // 2`).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, and `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. The overall state of the program is as follows:
    #- If `area` is not an integer, the console prints 'NO'.
    #- If `area` equals 0, the output is determined by the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
    #- If `area` is not 0:
    #  - `'0 1'` if `2 * area <= n`.
    #  - `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'` if `2 * area > n` and `2 * area <= m`.
    #  - `'0 0'` if `2 * area > m` and `m` is halved (`m // 2`).

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
