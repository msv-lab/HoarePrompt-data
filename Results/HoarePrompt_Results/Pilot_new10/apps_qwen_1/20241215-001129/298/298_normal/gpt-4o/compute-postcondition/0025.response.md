The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the definition `def func():`. The parameter constraints provided (n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) are not used within the function definition itself but might be relevant for understanding the context or potential use cases of the function.

Given the provided output cases are hypothetical since no actual function body is provided, we can still describe the functionality based on the given cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns either an error message if certain conditions are met or performs some unspecified operation based on the conditions provided in the output cases.**
