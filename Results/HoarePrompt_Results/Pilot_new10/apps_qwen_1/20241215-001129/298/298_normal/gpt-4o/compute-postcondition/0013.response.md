The code `print(f'0 1')` prints the string '0 1' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `area`, or the output being set to '0 0'. The only change is in the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`, the output is '0 0', and the printed output is '0 1'**
