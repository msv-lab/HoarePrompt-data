Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `area` is defined as `n * m / k`. If `2 * area <= m`, the output is `'1 2 * (n * m / k)'`. Otherwise, `m` is halved (`m // 2`), and the output is `'0 0'`. Both conditions `2 * area > n` and `2 * area > m` must still hold true after the execution of the if-else block.***
