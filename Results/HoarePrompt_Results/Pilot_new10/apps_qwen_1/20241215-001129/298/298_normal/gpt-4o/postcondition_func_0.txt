The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the standard input. It calculates the area as `n * m / k` and checks if this area is an integer. If the area is not an integer, it prints 'NO'. If the area is zero, it also prints 'NO'. Depending on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, it prints one of the following outputs:
