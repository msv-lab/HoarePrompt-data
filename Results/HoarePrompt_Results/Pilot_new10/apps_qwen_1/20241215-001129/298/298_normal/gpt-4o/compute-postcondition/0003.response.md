The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console but does not affect any variable values. The precondition remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`. The current value of `area` is not an integer, and the console prints 'NO'**
