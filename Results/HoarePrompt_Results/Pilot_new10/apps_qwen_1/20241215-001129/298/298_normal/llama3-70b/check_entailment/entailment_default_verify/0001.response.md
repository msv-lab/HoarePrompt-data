Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as it fails to ensure that the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) form a triangle with the required area \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The output hints confirm that the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correctly implemented for their respective tasks, but they do not address the core issue of ensuring the triangle's area is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\). Therefore, the program may incorrectly output "YES" for cases where no such points exist, leading to an incorrect solution.
