The function `func_2(a, b)` is called with `a` and `b` as arguments, but the definition of `func_2` is not provided. Since the function's implementation is not given, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y`. However, we know that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\), and after calling the function, the variables `x` and `y` are assigned the return values of `func_2`.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\); `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\); `x` is equal to the first return value of `func_2(a, b)`, and `y` is equal to the second return value of `func_2(a, b)`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le a \le 10^9\); `b` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\); `x` is equal to the first return value of `func_2(a, b)`, and `y` is equal to the second return value of `func_2(a, b)`**.
