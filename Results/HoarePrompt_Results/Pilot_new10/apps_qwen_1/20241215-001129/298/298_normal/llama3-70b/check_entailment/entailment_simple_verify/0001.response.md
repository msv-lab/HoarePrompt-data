Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly ensure that the points \((0, 0)\), \((0, n1 * m // g)\), and \((m1 * m // g, 0)\) form a triangle with the required area \(\frac{nm}{k}\). The program assumes that these points will always form a valid triangle, which is not guaranteed. For instance, as shown in the example \(n = 5\), \(m = 5\), \(k = 3\), the calculated points do not form a triangle with the exact required area. Therefore, the program's logic is flawed, and the original assessment correctly identifies this issue.
