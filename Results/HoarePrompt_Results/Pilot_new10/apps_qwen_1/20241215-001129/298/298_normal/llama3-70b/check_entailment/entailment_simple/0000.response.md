Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to use a GCD-related approach to generate valid points for the triangle but does not actually ensure that the area of the triangle formed by these points is exactly \(\frac{nm}{k}\).

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Area Calculation Check**: The program checks if `n * m % k == 0` to determine if a solution exists. However, this check alone is not sufficient to guarantee that the generated points will form a triangle with the desired area. The logic for generating points is flawed and does not necessarily produce points that satisfy the area condition.

2. **Point Generation**: The function `func_3` attempts to generate points using a GCD-related approach, but it does not ensure that the generated points form a triangle with the required area. The points generated might not even be valid for forming a triangle with the specified area.

3. **Triangle Area Condition**: The program assumes that the points generated by `func_3` will always form a triangle with the desired area, but this is not guaranteed. The area calculation for the triangle formed by the points is not verified or enforced within the program.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Verify if a solution exists by checking if \(\frac{nm}{k}\) is an integer.
2. Generate three points that form a triangle with the exact area \(\frac{nm}{k}\). One possible approach is to use the formula for the area of a triangle and ensure that the points satisfy the area condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
def solve(n, m, k):
    area = n * m / k
    if area != int(area):
        return 'NO'
    
    x1, y1 = 0, 0
    x2, y2 = n, 0
    x3, y3 = 0, m
    
    # Ensure the area of the triangle is exactly nm/k
    if x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2) + x1 * (y2 - y3) == int(area) * 2:
        return 'YES\n' + '\n'.join(map(str, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)]))
    else:
        return 'NO'

# Read input
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
print(solve(n, m, k))
```

This corrected version verifies the area condition and ensures that the points form a triangle with the exact area \(\frac{nm}{k}\). If the points do not satisfy the area condition, it returns 'NO'. If they do, it prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the points.
