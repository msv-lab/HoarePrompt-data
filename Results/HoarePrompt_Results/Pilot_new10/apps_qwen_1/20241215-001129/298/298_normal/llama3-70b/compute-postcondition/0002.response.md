The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b \le 10^9\). After executing the function body, the function returns three values: `x`, `y`, and `x*a + y*b`, where `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(a, b)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return three values: `x`, `y`, and `x*a + y*b`, where `x` and `y` are the results from calling `func_2(a, b)`.
