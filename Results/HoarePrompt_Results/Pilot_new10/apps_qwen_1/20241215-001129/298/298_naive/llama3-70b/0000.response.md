Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the calculated `g` from `func_3` might not lead to valid points that form a triangle with the required area. Specifically, the program checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g` to determine if there are valid points, which may not always be true. 

For example, consider the input `n=5`, `m=5`, and `k=8`. The area required is \( \frac{5*5}{8} = 3.125 \). The program calculates `n1`, `m1`, and `g` using the extended Euclidean algorithm, but it does not ensure that the calculated points actually form a triangle with the required area. In this case, the program incorrectly prints "YES" and provides points that do not form a triangle with the correct area.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the points provided form a triangle with the exact required area. This can be done by ensuring that the area formula is satisfied precisely, and checking the points' coordinates to form a valid triangle.
