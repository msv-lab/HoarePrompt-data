Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `area` is an integer but cannot form a valid triangle with the given constraints. Specifically, consider the input:

```
4 4 2
```

For this input:
- \( n = 4 \)
- \( m = 4 \)
- \( k = 2 \)

The required area of the triangle is \(\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{2} = 8\), which is an integer. However, it is impossible to form a triangle with area 8 using points within the bounds \(0 \le x_i \le 4\) and \(0 \le y_i \le 4\). The maximum possible area of a triangle within these bounds is 8 (for example, a triangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((4,4)\), and \((0,4)\)), but forming such a triangle requires specific coordinates that are not trivially generated by the current logic.

The current implementation only checks if the area is an integer and tries to place points based on a heuristic that may not always result in a valid triangle. It does not exhaustively check all possible configurations to ensure a valid triangle can always be formed. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
