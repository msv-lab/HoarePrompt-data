`k` and `l` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `f`, and `days` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is now `[ (k, l) ]`, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
