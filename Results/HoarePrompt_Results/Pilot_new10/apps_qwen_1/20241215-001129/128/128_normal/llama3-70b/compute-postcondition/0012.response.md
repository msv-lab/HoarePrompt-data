The code sorts the list `days` based on the difference between the second element and the first element of each tuple in descending order. This means that the list `days` will be sorted such that the tuple with the largest difference between its elements comes first, and so on.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\)
- `days` is a list containing `n` tuples \([(k_1, l_1), (k_2, l_2), \ldots, (k_n, l_n)]\), where each \((k_i, l_i)\) is a tuple of integers entered by the user.

After sorting `days` based on the criteria given, the output state will include:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` remains the same integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `f` remains the same integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\)
- `days` is now a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the difference \(l_i - k_i\) for each tuple \((k_i, l_i)\).

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is an integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the difference \(l_i - k_i` for each tuple \((k_i, l_i)`**.
