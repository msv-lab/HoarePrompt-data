`n` and `f` are assigned the values from `input().split()`. Since `input().split()` returns a list of strings, these values need to be converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. After this operation, `n` and `f` will hold the integer values provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `f` is an integer such that 0 ≤ f ≤ n**
