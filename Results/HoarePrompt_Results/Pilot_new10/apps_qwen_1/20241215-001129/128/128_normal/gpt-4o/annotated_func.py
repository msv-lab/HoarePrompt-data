#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and f are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ f ≤ n. days is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for the i-th day, respectively.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), `days` is an empty list, `regular_sales` is a list of length `n`, where each element is `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for \(0 \leq i < n\), `potential_sales_increase` is a list of length `n`, where each element is `min(2 * days[i][0], days[i][1]) - min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for \(0 \leq i < n\).
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #`The program returns total_sales which is the sum of list 'regular_sales' and the sum of the first 'f' elements of list 'potential_sales_increase'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `f` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq f \leq n\), and `days` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers `k_i` and `l_i` such that \(0 \leq k_i, l_i \leq 10^9\). The function calculates `total_sales` as the sum of `regular_sales` and the sum of the first `f` elements of `potential_sales_increase`. `regular_sales` is computed as the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each day, while `potential_sales_increase` is computed as the difference between the minimum of twice `k_i` and `l_i` and the minimum of `k_i` and `l_i` for each day. The function returns `total_sales`.
