The code initializes an empty list called `regular_sales`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `f`, or the contents of the `days` list. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `regular_sales` list.

Output State: **`n` and `f` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ f ≤ n; `days` is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers k_i and l_i such that 0 ≤ k_i, l_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of products on the shelves and the number of clients for the i-th day, respectively; `regular_sales` is an empty list**
