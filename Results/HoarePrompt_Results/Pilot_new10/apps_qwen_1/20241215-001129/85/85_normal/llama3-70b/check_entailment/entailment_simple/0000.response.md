Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Objective of the Problem**: The problem requires finding the number of pairs of shovels such that the sum of their costs ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The solution should focus on identifying pairs \((i, j)\) where \(i + j\) ends with the maximum number of nines.

2. **Current Implementation**: The program iterates over each possible first shovel \(i\) from 1 to \(n/2\), checks if \(i + (n - i)\) ends with the maximum number of nines, and increments the count accordingly. However, this approach is flawed because it only considers pairs where the second shovel is \(n - i\).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: For \(n = 7\), the pairs that meet the condition are (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5). But the current program does not check other valid pairs like (1, 8), which also form valid pairs ending with 9 (e.g., 1+8=9, 1+18=19, etc.).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the maximum number of trailing nines in the sum \(i + j\).
   - Iterate through all possible pairs and count those whose sum ends with the maximum number of nines.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the sum and find the number of trailing nines
        total_cost = i + (n - i)
        while total_cost % 10 == 9:
            max_nines += 1
            total_cost //= 10
    
    # The number of valid pairs is the number of nines plus one
    # because we can form pairs (i, n-i) for each valid i
    num_pairs = max_nines * (max_nines + 1) // 2
    print(num_pairs)
```

This corrected version ensures that all valid pairs are considered, ensuring the output matches the problem description accurately.
