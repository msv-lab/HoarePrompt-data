The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some condition related to the integer `n` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.

However, since no specific output logic is provided, I can only describe what the function should accept and return in terms of its parameter (even though no parameter is actually passed).

Given the constraints, the function might return something based on the value of `n`, but without additional details, the most accurate description is as follows:

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the integer `n` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, although no parameters are accepted by the function.**
