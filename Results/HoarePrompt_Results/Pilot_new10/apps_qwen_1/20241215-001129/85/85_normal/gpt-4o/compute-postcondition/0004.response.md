`n` is divided by 10 using integer division (//). The value of `n` originally ends in 9 and is between 2 and \(10^9\), so after dividing by 10, the last digit of `n` will no longer be 9. The value of `max_9s` remains unchanged at 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input from the user, ending in a digit other than 9, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, ending in a digit other than 9, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 1**
