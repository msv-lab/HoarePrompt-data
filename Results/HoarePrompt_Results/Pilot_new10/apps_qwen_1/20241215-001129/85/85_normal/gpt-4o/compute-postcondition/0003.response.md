`max_9s` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `max_9s` is 0, so now `max_9s` is 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it was the integer input from the user and ends in 9, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user and ends in 9, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 1**
