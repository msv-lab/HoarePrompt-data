The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. Given that `n` must end in 9, dividing `n` by 10 will remove the last digit (which is 9) from `n`. After the division, `max_9s` is increased by 1, but the exact value of `max_9s` is not specified in the initial state.

Since `n` ends in 9, after performing the operation `n //= 10`, `n` will no longer end in 9. The value of `max_9s` will be increased by 1, but its specific value is not given, so we only know it has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` does not end in 9; `max_9s` is increased by 1**
