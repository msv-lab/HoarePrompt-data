The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. Since `n` must end in 9, when we divide `n` by 10, the last digit (which is 9) will be removed. The precondition that `n` must end in 9 remains true for the new value of `n`.

Let's represent the initial value of `n` as `10k + 9`, where `k` is an integer. After executing the code, `n` becomes `k`.

The precondition that `max_9s` is increased by 2 is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is `k` (where `n` originally ended in 9); `max_9s` is increased by 2**
