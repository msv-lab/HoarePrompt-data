According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`. For the loop to execute, the value of `(n + 1) % 10` must be equal to 0. 

Right before the loop, `n` is the integer input from the user, and `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. For `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` to be true, `n + 1` must end in a 0. This means that `n` must end in a 9. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` ends in a 9.

State: **`n` is the integer input from the user and ends in 9, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `max_9s` is 0**
