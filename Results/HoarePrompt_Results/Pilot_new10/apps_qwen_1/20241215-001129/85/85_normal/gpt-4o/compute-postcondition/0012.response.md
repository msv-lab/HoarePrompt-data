The code calculates `pairs` as `(n + 1) * max_9s`. Here, `n` is the integer input from the user and does not end in a 9, meaning it is not divisible by 10. `max_9s` is the count of consecutive trailing 9s in the original value of `n`, which is 0 because `n` does not end in 9.

Therefore, `pairs` is calculated as `(n + 1) * 0`, which results in 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input from the user, `max_9s` is 0, `pairs` is 0**
