Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used to check if the sum of the two shovels' costs ends with the maximum number of nines is flawed. Specifically, the condition `(i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0` checks if the sum ends with a certain number of zeros, not nines.

For example, consider `n = 50`. According to the problem description, the optimal pair should be (49, 50) since their sum is 99, which ends with two nines. However, the program will not correctly identify this pair because it checks for trailing zeros instead of nines.

To fix this, the condition should check for trailing nines instead of zeros. This would involve using modulo operation with a power of 10 corresponding to the number of nines required.
