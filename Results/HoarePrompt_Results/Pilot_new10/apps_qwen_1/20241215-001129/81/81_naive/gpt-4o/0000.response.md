Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `z` (which is `y // x`) is a perfect square and both `a` and `b` are equal. Specifically, the program checks if `a` and `b` are different and counts each pair twice. However, if `a` and `b` are the same, the program should only count it once. 

For example, consider the input `(l, r, x, y) = (1, 10, 1, 10)`. The value of `z` will be `10`, and the factors of `10` are `1` and `10`. When `i = 1`, `a = 1` and `b = 10`, and when `i = 10`, `a = 10` and `b = 1`. The program correctly identifies these pairs, but since `a` and `b` are not equal in these cases, it counts each pair twice. However, if `a` and `b` are the same (which happens when `i = sqrt(10)`), the program should only count it once.

To fix this, we need to ensure that when `a` and `b` are the same, we increment the count by 1 instead of 2. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func_1(l, r, x, y):
    if y % x != 0:
        return 0
    z = y // x
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(z)) + 1):
        if z % i == 0:
            a = i * x
            b = z // i * x
            if l <= a <= r and l <= b <= r and (math.gcd(a, b) == x) and (a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y):
                if a == b:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count += 2
    # Ensure to check the middle case separately
    if int(math.sqrt(z))**2 == z and l <= int(math.sqrt(z)) * x <= r:
        count += 1
    return count
```

This ensures that if `a` and `b` are the same, the count is incremented only once.
