Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function ensures that after the loop, `a` contains the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. This function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are negative, although the input constraints ensure non-negativity.**
