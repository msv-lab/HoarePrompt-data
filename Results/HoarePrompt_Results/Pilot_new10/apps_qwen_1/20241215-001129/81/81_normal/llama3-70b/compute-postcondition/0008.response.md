The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq 10^9\). The function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. After executing the function body, the function returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which corresponds to the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.**
