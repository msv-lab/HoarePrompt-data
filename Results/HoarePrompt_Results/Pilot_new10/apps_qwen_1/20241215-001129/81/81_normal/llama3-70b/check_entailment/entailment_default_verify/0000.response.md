Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a pair (a, b) is good. While `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, `func_2` incorrectly calculates the LCM. The LCM should be calculated as `a * b // gcd(a, b)`, but the current implementation does not correctly handle all cases, especially when `a` and `b` are not coprime. The output hints confirm that `func_1` and `func_2` do not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results for all inputs.
