Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of good pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y within the given range [l, r]. The code iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) in the range [l, r] and checks if they satisfy the conditions using `func_1` and `func_2`. However, this approach is inefficient and does not guarantee correctness due to the following reasons:

1. The code uses a brute-force approach by iterating over all pairs (a, b) in the range [l, r], which is computationally expensive and not optimal.
2. The logic in the nested loops does not ensure that the pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are treated as different pairs if a â‰  b, as required by the problem statement.
3. The code does not handle edge cases where no pairs (a, b) exist that satisfy the conditions GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y within the given range [l, r].

For example, consider the input:
```
50 100 3 30
```
The correct output should be 0 because there are no pairs (a, b) such that GCD(a, b) = 3 and LCM(a, b) = 30 within the range [50, 100]. However, the provided code would still iterate over all pairs in the range, leading to an incorrect count of good pairs.
