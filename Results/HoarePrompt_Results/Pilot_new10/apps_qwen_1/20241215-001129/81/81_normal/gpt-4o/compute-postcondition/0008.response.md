`b` is assigned the value `z // i * x`. Given the initial state, `z % i == 0`, which means `z` is divisible by `i`. So, `z // i` is an integer. Let's denote this integer as `k`, where `k = z // i`. Therefore, `b = k * x`, and since `a = i * x`, we can substitute `x` in the expression for `b` as `a / i`. Thus, the output state is: `z` is at least 1, there exists an integer `i` such that `z % i == 0`; `a` is `i * x`; `b` is `(z // i) * x`, which simplifies to `a / i`.

Output State: **`z` is at least 1, there exists an integer `i` such that `z % i == 0`; `a` is `i * x`; `b` is `a / i`**
