Postcondition: ***`z` is at least 1; \( z \% (i + 1) == 0 \); \( a \) and \( b \) are integers such that \( a = i \times x \) and \( b = z // i \times x \); both \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy \( l \leq a \leq r \) and \( l \leq b \leq r \); \( \mathit{math.gcd}(a, b) == x \); \( a \times b // \mathit{math.gcd}(a, b) == y \); the count is updated to count + 1 if \( a \) equals \( b \), otherwise the count is updated to count + 2; \( z \% (i + 1) == 0 \) remains true.***
