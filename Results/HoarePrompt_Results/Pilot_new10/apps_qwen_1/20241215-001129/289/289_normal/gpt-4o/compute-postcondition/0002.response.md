The code `print(max_games)` simply prints the value of `max_games`. Since the initial state of `max_games` is defined as `n.bit_length() - 1`, and this value does not change by printing it, the output of the print statement will be the value of `max_games` from the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State remains:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{18}\) inclusive; `max_games` is `n.bit_length() - 1`**
