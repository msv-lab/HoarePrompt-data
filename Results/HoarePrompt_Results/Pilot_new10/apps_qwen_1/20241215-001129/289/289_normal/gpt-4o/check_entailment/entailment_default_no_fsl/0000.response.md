Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the maximum number of games using `n.bit_length() - 1`, which gives the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. This approach does not consider the specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by two players being no more than 1. For example, for `n = 4`, the correct answer should be 2 (pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4), then the winner of each pair plays), but the code returns 2, which is incorrect because it does not account for the rule. Similarly, for `n = 10`, the correct answer should be 4, but the code also returns 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
