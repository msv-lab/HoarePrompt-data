Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the grasshopper can jump over obstacles but needs to land on an empty cell. Specifically, the program only checks if the grasshopper can reach the target position `T` without considering the possibility of intermediate cells being empty. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
7 3
T..#..G
```

In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 3 and needs to reach position 6. Although the direct path involves jumping over an obstacle at position 4, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not account for the fact that the grasshopper can jump over the obstacle and land on an empty cell. The correct output should be "YES" since the grasshopper can jump over the obstacle and reach the target.
