Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to check if the starting position `G` and the target position `T` are within the bounds of the line and if the grasshopper can reach the target considering the direction of jumps. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
6 2
..#T#G
```

- The grasshopper starts at position 5 (`G`).
- The target is at position 3 (`T`).
- The jump length `k` is 2.

The program will attempt to start from position 5 and check positions 3, 7, etc., but since position 7 is out of bounds, it will not correctly determine that the grasshopper cannot reach the target. 

To fix this, the program should ensure that the grasshopper can stay within the bounds of the line during its jumps. Here is a modified version that checks for the bounds correctly:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    
    # Ensure G_pos is less than T_pos
    if G_pos > T_pos:
        (G_pos, T_pos) = (T_pos, G_pos)
    
    # Check if the grasshopper can reach T from G within bounds
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    if reachable:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This modification ensures that the program checks each possible position within the bounds of the line and correctly determines if the grasshopper can reach the target.
