Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`.
- `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
- `line` is the input string.
- `reachable` is `False`.
- If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, `G_pos` is set to the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line` and `T_pos` is set to the index of the original position of 'G' in `line`, otherwise the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with a step size of `k`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
1. **Range Validity**: The loop will only execute if there are elements in the range specified by `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with a step of `k`.
2. **Initial Values of `G_pos` and `T_pos`**: Both `G_pos` and `T_pos` should be valid indices within the bounds of the string `string` (i.e., between 0 and `n-1`).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`G_pos` and `T_pos` Values**:
   - For the loop to execute, `G_pos` and `T_pos` must both be valid indices within the string `string` (0 ≤ `G_pos` < `n` and 0 ≤ `T_pos` < `n`).
   - Additionally, the condition for updating `G_pos` and `T_pos` must be met. This means either `G_pos` is initially greater than `T_pos` or the positions are already correct.

2. **Range Validity**:
   - The range `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` should contain at least one element. This means `G_pos` should be less than or equal to `T_pos + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states such that the loop condition is satisfied:

- `G_pos` and `T_pos` should be valid indices.
- If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, `G_pos` should be updated to the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line`, and `T_pos` should be updated to the index of the original position of 'G' in `line`.
- Otherwise, `G_pos` and `T_pos` should already be in the correct order and valid.

### Final State:
- `G_pos` and `T_pos` should be valid indices within the string `string`.
- `G_pos` and `T_pos` should satisfy the condition for updating their values if necessary.
- The range `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` should contain at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `False`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, and the range `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element**.
