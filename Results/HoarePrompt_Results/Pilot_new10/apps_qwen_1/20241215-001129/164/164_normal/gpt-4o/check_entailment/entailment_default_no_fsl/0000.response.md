Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not account for the possibility that the grasshopper can jump both to the left and to the right. The current implementation only checks jumps to the right, which is insufficient. For example, consider the following input:

```
5 2
G#T#.
```

In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 0, and the insect is at position 3. The grasshopper can jump to the right (k=2) to position 2, but then it needs to jump left (k=2) to position 3 to reach the insect. The current code would incorrectly print "NO" because it only checks jumps to the right.

To fix this, the code should check both directions (left and right) and ensure that the grasshopper can reach the insect within the allowed number of jumps. Here is an improved version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')

    # Check both directions (left and right)
    for direction in [-1, 1]:
        pos = G_pos
        reachable = True
        while 0 <= pos < n and pos != T_pos:
            pos += direction * k
            if pos < 0 or pos >= n or line[pos] == '#':
                reachable = False
                break
        if reachable and pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
    
    print('NO')

func()
```

This updated code checks both left and right directions, ensuring that the grasshopper can reach the insect within the allowed number of jumps.
