Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`.
- `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
- `line` is the input string.
- `reachable` is `False`.
- If `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`, `G_pos` is set to the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line` and `T_pos` is set to the index of the original position of 'G' in `line`. Otherwise, the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain unchanged.

### Loop Code
```python
for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
    if line[pos] == '#':
        break
    if pos == T_pos:
        reachable = True
        break
```

### Analysis
1. **Initialization**: Initially, `reachable` is `False`. `G_pos` and `T_pos` are set based on the condition provided in the initial state.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with a step size of `k`.
   - If `line[pos]` is `'#'` at any point, the loop breaks.
   - If `pos` equals `T_pos` during the iteration, `reachable` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.

### Key Observations
- The loop will only set `reachable` to `True` if `pos` reaches `T_pos` without encountering `'#'`.
- If `line[pos]` is `'#'` at any point, the loop will break and `reachable` will remain `False`.

### Final State Analysis
- **Case 1**: If the loop does not execute (e.g., `G_pos > T_pos` initially or the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` is empty), then `reachable` remains `False`.
- **Case 2**: If the loop executes and sets `reachable` to `True`, this means `pos` reached `T_pos` without encountering `'#'`.

### Output State
The final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations can be summarized as follows:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`.
- `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.
- `line` is the input string.
- `reachable` is `True` if `pos` reaches `T_pos` without encountering `'#'`; otherwise, `reachable` is `False`.
- `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string.
- The range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` is checked during the loop, and if `line[pos]` is `'#'` at any point, the loop breaks.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `True` if `pos` reaches `T_pos` without encountering `'#'`; otherwise, `reachable` is `False`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` is checked during the loop, and if `line[pos]` is `'#'` at any point, the loop breaks.**
