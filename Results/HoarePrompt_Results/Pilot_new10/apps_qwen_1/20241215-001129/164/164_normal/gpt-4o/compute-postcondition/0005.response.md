The code swaps the values of `G_pos` and `T_pos`. Initially, `G_pos` is greater than `T_pos`. After swapping, `G_pos` will take the value of `T_pos`, and `T_pos` will take the value of `G_pos`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, the string is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `G_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the original position of 'G' in `line`.**
