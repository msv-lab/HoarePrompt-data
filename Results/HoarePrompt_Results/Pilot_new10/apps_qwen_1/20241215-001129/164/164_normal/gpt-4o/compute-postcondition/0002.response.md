`G_pos` is assigned the index of the character 'G' in the string `line`. The value of `G_pos` will be an integer between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, depending on the position of 'G' in the string. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), the string is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), the string is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`**
