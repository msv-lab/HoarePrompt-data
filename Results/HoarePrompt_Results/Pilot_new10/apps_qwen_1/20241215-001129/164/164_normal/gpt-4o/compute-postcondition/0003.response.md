The code `T_pos = line.index('T')` finds the index of the character 'T' in the string `line`. This affects the value of `T_pos` while keeping the other variables unchanged. Since `line` is an input string and its contents are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `T_pos`. However, we know that `T_pos` will be assigned the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, the string is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `line`**
