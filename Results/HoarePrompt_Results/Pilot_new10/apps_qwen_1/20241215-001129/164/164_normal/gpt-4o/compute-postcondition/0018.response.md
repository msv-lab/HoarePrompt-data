Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `True` if `(pos + k)` equals `T_pos`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element, and if `line[pos]` is '#', the condition remains as is, otherwise no change to the variables.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and is effectively doing nothing (no changes to variables), the postcondition remains the same as the precondition when the if condition is not met. Therefore, the overall postcondition combines the conditions of the if part and the fact that no changes occur in the else part.
