The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq n - 1 \), and a string of length \( n \) containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. It then determines if the grasshopper can reach the insect within \( k \) moves, where each move can either be to the left or to the right, and prints 'YES' if the grasshopper can reach the insect within \( k \) moves, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function checks the positions of the grasshopper ('G') and the insect ('T'), sorts their positions if necessary, and iterates through the range from the grasshopper's position to the insect's position in steps of \( k \), checking for obstacles ('#'). If an obstacle is found or the grasshopper cannot reach the insect within \( k \) moves, the function prints 'NO'. If the grasshopper reaches the insect's position, the function prints 'YES'.
