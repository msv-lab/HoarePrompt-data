`n` and `k` are assigned the values of `map(int, input().split())`, which means they are converted from strings to integers. The initial string remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), the string is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'**
