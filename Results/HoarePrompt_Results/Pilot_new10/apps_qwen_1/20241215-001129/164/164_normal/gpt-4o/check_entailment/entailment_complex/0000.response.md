Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input and the string representing the line with obstacles, grasshopper, and insect.

2. **Position Identification**: The program identifies the positions of the grasshopper ('G') and the insect ('T') accurately using the `index` method.

3. **Adjusting Positions**: If the initial position of the grasshopper (`G_pos`) is greater than the position of the insect (`T_pos`), the positions are swapped to ensure the grasshopper's position is less than the insect's position. This simplifies the logic for the subsequent check.

4. **Range Check**: The program uses a for loop to iterate through possible positions in steps of \( k \) from the grasshopper's position to the insect's position. This ensures that the grasshopper's movement is in accordance with the problem's constraints.

5. **Obstacle Detection**: Within the loop, the program checks for obstacles ('#'). If an obstacle is encountered, the loop breaks, indicating the grasshopper cannot move further.

6. **Target Reaching**: If the loop reaches the insect's position without hitting an obstacle, the variable `reachable` is set to `True`, and the program prints 'YES'. If the loop ends due to an obstacle or naturally (reaching the end of the range), the program prints 'NO'.

The logic of the program matches the problem description perfectly. It handles all edge cases, such as when the grasshopper's starting position is greater than the insect's position, and it correctly checks for the presence of obstacles and the ability to reach the target within the allowed jumps. Therefore, the program is correct.
