Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1`, `string` is a sequence of length `n` containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', `line` is the input string, `reachable` is `True`, `G_pos` and `T_pos` are valid indices within the string, the range from `G_pos` to `T_pos + 1` with step `k` contains at least one element, and `pos` is `G_pos + k`. If `line[pos]` is '#', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `line[pos]` is not '#`, the program continues without any specific action defined in the else part.***
