Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
   - `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive.
   - `s` is a string input from the user.
   - `g` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1.
   - `t` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1.
   - `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 and must be less than `n`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `s[i] == 'G'`, then `g` is updated to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `g` remains the same.
   - If `s[i] == 'T'`, then `t` is updated to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

5. **New State After Incrementing `i`:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `g` and `t` remain as they were unless `s[i]` matches 'G' or 'T'.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `g` and `t` remain unchanged unless `s[i + 1]` matches 'G' or 'T'.
   - `n`, `k`, `s`, `g`, and `t` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1, `t` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.
