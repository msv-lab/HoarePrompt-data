The function reads two integers `n` and `k` and a string `s` of length `n` from standard input, where `s` contains characters representing cells in a grid (empty, obstacles, grasshopper, and target). It then checks if the grasshopper can jump to the target insect in exactly `k` jumps, where each jump covers a distance that is a multiple of `k` cells. If the grasshopper cannot reach the target due to the presence of obstacles or the invalid starting or target positions, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
