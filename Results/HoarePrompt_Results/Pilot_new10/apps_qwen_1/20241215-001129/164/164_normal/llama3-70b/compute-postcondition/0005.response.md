The code assigns the value of the index `i` (where `s[i]` is 'G') to the variable `g`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the index `i` (where `s[i]` is 'G'), `t` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the index `i` (where `s[i]` is 'G'), `t` is -1**
