`g` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, which means `g` now holds that specific value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration, `t` is the index `i` of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 and must be less than `n`**
