#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The second line of input is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a cell with an obstacle, 'G' represents the grasshopper's starting position, and 'T' represents the target insect's position. It is guaranteed that both 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.

Otherwise, 'NO' is printed to the console.

Otherwise, 'NO' is printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` and a string `s` of length `n` from standard input, where `s` contains characters representing cells in a grid (empty, obstacles, grasshopper, and target). It then checks if the grasshopper can jump to the target insect in exactly `k` jumps, where each jump covers a distance that is a multiple of `k` cells. If the grasshopper cannot reach the target due to the presence of obstacles or the invalid starting or target positions, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
