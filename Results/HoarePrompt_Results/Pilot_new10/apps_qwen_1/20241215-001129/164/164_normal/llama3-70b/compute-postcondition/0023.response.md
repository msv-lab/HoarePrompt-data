The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `s` is a string input from the user, `g` is the index of the first occurrence of 'G' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `g` is -1, `t` is the index of the first occurrence of 'T' in `s` if such an occurrence exists; otherwise, `t` remains -1, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
