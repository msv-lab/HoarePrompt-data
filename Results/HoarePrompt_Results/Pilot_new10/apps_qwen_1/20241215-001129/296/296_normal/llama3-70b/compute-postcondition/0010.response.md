The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a value based on some condition involving a positive integer `n` within the range 2 to \(10^9\), but since no specific condition or output logic is provided in the prompt, we can only describe the parameter constraint.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on a condition involving a positive integer `n` where 2 <= n <= \(10^9\).**
