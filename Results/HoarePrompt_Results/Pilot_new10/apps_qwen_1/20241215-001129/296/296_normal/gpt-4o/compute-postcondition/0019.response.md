Postcondition: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 4, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is either `[2, 3, n // 3, 3, n // 3, 4]` if `n % 3 == 0` or `[2, 3, n // 3, 4]` if `n % 3 != 0`. In both cases, the list `divisors` is appended with the value 4.**
