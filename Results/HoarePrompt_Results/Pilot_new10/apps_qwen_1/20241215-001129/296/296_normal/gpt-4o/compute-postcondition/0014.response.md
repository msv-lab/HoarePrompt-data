Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is `[2, 3, n // 3, 3, n // 3]`***

Explanation: Since there is no else part in the code, the overall postcondition is simply the postcondition of the if part. According to the if part, if `i != n // i`, then `n // i` (which is `n // 3`) is appended to the list `divisors`. Thus, the final state of `divisors` becomes `[2, 3, n // 3, 3, n // 3]`. All other variables (`total`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states as per the precondition.
