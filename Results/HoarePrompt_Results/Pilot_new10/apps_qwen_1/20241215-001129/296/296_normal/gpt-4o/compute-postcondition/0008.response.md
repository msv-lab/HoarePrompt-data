The code `divisors.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `divisors`. Given the initial state, `divisors` is `[2, i]` and `i` is not equal to `n // i`. After executing the code, the value of `divisors` will be updated to include `n // i`.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and given that `i` is not equal to `n // i`, the value of `n // i` is a specific integer that is neither 2 nor `i`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is `[2, i, n // i]`, and `i` is not equal to `n // i`.**
