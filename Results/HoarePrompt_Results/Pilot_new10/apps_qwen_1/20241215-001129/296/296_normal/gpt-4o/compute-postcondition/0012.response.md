The code `divisors.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `divisors`. The initial value of `divisors` is `[2, 3, n // 3]` unless the condition `3 != n // 3` fails. Since `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `n // 3` will be less than `n` and thus the condition `3 != n // 3` will always be true. Therefore, the initial value of `divisors` is `[2, 3, n // 3]`.

After appending `i` (which is 3) to `divisors`, the list `divisors` becomes `[2, 3, n // 3, 3]`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is greater than 2, `divisors` is `[2, 3, n // 3, 3]`**
