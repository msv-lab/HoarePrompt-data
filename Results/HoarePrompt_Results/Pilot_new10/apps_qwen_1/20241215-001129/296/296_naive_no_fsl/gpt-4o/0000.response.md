Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not ensure that the sum of the fractions equals \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). Here's a case where the program fails:

For \(n = 4\), the correct output should be:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 4
```
because \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{4}\).

However, the current implementation only generates fractions with denominators that are divisors of \(n\), but it does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions will equal \(1 - \frac{1}{n}\). For \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
NO
```
This indicates that the program fails to find a valid sequence of fractions for \(n = 4\), which is incorrect since such a sequence does exist. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
