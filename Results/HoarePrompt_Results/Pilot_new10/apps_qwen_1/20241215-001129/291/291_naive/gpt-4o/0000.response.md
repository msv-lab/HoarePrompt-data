Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler. The given solution seems to be attempting to find a way to minimize the number of initial segments needed to draw \( n \) squares, but the formula used is incorrect.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

- **Input**: `n = 2`

According to the problem description, drawing 2 squares requires drawing 3 segments initially with a ruler, as shown in the provided example. However, the program outputs 3, which seems correct at first glance, but let's check another case to ensure it works for all inputs.

- **Input**: `n = 3`

Based on the problem description, drawing 3 squares would require 4 segments initially with a ruler, as shown below:

```
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |
```

Here, the first 3 segments are drawn with a ruler, and the remaining 6 segments can be drawn using these as guides. However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as 5, which is not minimal.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and hence the correctness is **False**.
