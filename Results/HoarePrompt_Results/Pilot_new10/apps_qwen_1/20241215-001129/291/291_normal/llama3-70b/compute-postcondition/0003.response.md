Let's break down the code step by step to determine its functionality:

1. The function `func()` does not accept any parameters.
2. Inside the function, `n` is assigned the value obtained from `input()`. This means the function expects user input.
3. The function then prints the value of `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.

To understand the logic, let's analyze the expression `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`:

- `n.bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent the integer `n` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.
- Subtracting 1 from `n.bit_length()` gives the number of bits minus one.
- Multiplying by 2 doubles this value.
- Adding 2 to the result gives the final output.

Given the return postconditions and the code, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts user input `n` (an integer), and prints the value `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.**
