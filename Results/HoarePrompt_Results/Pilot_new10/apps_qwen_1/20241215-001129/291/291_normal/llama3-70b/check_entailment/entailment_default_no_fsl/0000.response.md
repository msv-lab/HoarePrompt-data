Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` does not accurately calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler for all values of \( n \).

Let's analyze a few cases:

1. **Case \( n = 1 \):**
   - According to the problem description, drawing one square requires drawing two segments initially and then two more guided segments, totaling 4 segments.
   - However, the code outputs `2 * (1.bit_length() - 1) + 2 = 2 * (1 - 1) + 2 = 2`, which is incorrect.

2. **Case \( n = 2 \):**
   - Drawing two squares requires drawing three segments initially and then four more guided segments, totaling 7 segments.
   - The code outputs `2 * (2.bit_length() - 1) + 2 = 2 * (2 - 1) + 2 = 4`, which is also incorrect.

3. **General Case:**
   - The problem description suggests a recursive pattern where each additional square often reuses previously drawn segments.
   - The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` does not capture the correct pattern. For example, for \( n = 4 \), the correct answer is 4, but the code outputs `2 * (4.bit_length() - 1) + 2 = 6`, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, a different approach is needed, possibly involving dynamic programming or a more detailed analysis of the segment reuse pattern. The current implementation does not accurately reflect the logic required to minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler.
