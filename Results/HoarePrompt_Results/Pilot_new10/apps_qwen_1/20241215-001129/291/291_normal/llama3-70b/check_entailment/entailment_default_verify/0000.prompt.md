You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler. According to the problem description, for each additional square added, only one new segment needs to be drawn with a ruler. This is because after the first two segments, each subsequent square can share sides with previously drawn segments.

Let's analyze the provided solution:
- The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` seems to be attempting to calculate the number of segments needed.
- However, this formula does not accurately reflect the logic required.

For example, consider the following cases:

1. **Input: 1**
   - According to the problem, to draw 1 square, 2 segments are needed.
   - Output: `2`
   - This is correct.

2. **Input: 2**
   - To draw 2 squares, 3 segments are needed.
   - Output: `3`
   - This is correct.

3. **Input: 4**
   - To draw 4 squares, 4 segments are needed.
   - Output: `4`
   - This is correct.

However, consider the general case:
- For \( n \) squares, the number of segments drawn with a ruler should be \( 2 + (n - 1) \). This is because the first two segments are drawn with a ruler, and each subsequent square shares sides with previously drawn segments.

For example:
- For \( n = 5 \):
  - The correct number of segments drawn with a ruler should be \( 2 + (5 - 1) = 6 \).
  - But the program outputs: `2 * (5.bit_length() - 1) + 2 = 2 * (3 - 1) + 2 = 6`, which seems correct initially, but let's check another case to ensure accuracy.

- For \( n = 8 \):
  - The correct number of segments drawn with a ruler should be \( 2 + (8 - 1) = 9 \).
  - But the program outputs: `2 * (8.bit_length() - 1) + 2 = 2 * (4 - 1) + 2 = 8`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the number of segments drawn with a ruler for all potential cases. Hence, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts user input `n` (an integer), and prints the value `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
