Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum number of segments needed by iterating over possible values of `a` and calculating `b` as `(n + a - 1) // a`. However, the formula used to calculate the number of segments needed is incorrect. According to the problem description, the minimum number of segments needed is actually `2 * (a + b)` where `a` and `b` are dimensions of the grid formed by the squares. 

To illustrate why the current implementation is incorrect, consider the following example:

- **Input**: `n = 4`

According to the problem description, the optimal way to draw 4 squares would be to draw a 2x2 grid, which requires drawing 4 segments horizontally and 4 segments vertically, totaling 8 segments. However, the current implementation calculates `a` and `b` such that `a * b = 4`. Possible pairs are `(1, 4)` and `(2, 2)`.

- For `a = 1` and `b = 4`:
  - Segments needed: `2 * (1 + 4) = 10`

- For `a = 2` and `b = 2`:
  - Segments needed: `2 * (2 + 2) = 8`

The correct minimum is 8, but the code incorrectly returns 10. This is because the formula used to calculate the number of segments is not appropriate for the problem.

The correct approach should be to directly calculate the dimensions `a` and `b` such that `a * b = n` and then compute the minimum number of segments needed as `2 * (a + b)`. The current implementation fails to accurately reflect this logic, hence the code is incorrect.
