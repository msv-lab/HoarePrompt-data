Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of \( n \) digits where \( 2 \le n \le 100 \), `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is the number of segments found such that the sum of digits in each segment equals `target_sum`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ticket` is a string consisting of \( n \) digits where \( 2 \le n \le 100 \).
   - `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even.
   - `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
   - `curr_sum` is 0.
   - `segments` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each digit in `ticket`.
   - For each digit, `curr_sum` is incremented by the value of the digit.
   - If `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`, `segments` is incremented by 1, and `curr_sum` is reset to 0.

3. **After Loop Execution**:
   - After all iterations, `curr_sum` will be 0 because any remaining `curr_sum` would have been reset to 0 when `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`.
   - `segments` will be the number of segments found such that the sum of digits in each segment equals `target_sum`.

Thus, the final values of the variables after the loop completes all iterations are:
- `ticket`: remains the same.
- `total_sum`: remains the same (since it's a property derived from `ticket`).
- `target_sum`: remains the same (since it's derived from `total_sum`).
- `curr_sum`: 0 (since it gets reset to 0 after finding a segment).
- `segments`: the number of segments found such that the sum of digits in each segment equals `target_sum`.
