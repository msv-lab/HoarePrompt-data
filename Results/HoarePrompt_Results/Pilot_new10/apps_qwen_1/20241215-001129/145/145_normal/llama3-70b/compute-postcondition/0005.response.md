The code initializes `curr_sum` to 0. The value of `curr_sum` is updated, but the exact value depends on the digits in `ticket`. The other variables (`ticket`, `total_sum`, and `target_sum`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of $n$ digits where $2 \le n \le 100$ and each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even; `target_sum` is total_sum // 2; `curr_sum` is 0.**
