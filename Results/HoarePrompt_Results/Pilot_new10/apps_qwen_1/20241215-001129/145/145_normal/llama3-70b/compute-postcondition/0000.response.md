The code `total_sum = sum(ticket)` calculates the sum of the digits in the `ticket` string and assigns it to the variable `total_sum`. Since `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits, the `sum()` function will convert each character (digit) in the string to an integer and add them up. The `ticket` string remains unchanged, and `total_sum` is assigned the sum of its digits.

Output State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of $n$ digits where $2 \le n \le 100$ and each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`.**
