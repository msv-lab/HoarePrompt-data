Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `ticket` is a string consisting of \( n \) digits where \( 2 \le n \le 100 \).
   - `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even.
   - `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`.
   - `curr_sum` is the original `curr_sum` plus the value of the current digit from `ticket`.
   - `segments` is 1 if `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`. Otherwise, `segments` remains 0.

2. **Understand the for loop structure:**
   ```python
   for digit in ticket:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the changes needed at the start of the next iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each digit in `ticket`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `digit` would be the last digit processed, and `curr_sum` would be updated based on this digit.
   - `segments` will remain 0 unless `curr_sum` equals `target_sum` during this iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `digit`: This will be the next digit in `ticket` that hasn't been processed yet.
   - `curr_sum`: This will be the previous `curr_sum` plus the value of the current `digit`.
   - `segments`: This will remain 0 unless `curr_sum` equals `target_sum`.

Given these points, the states to adjust at the start of the next iteration are:
- `digit` is the next digit in `ticket`.
- `curr_sum` is the previous `curr_sum` plus the value of the current `digit`.
- `segments` remains 0.

Since we don't know the exact value of the next digit (`digit`), we can only say it is the next digit in `ticket`. However, we can represent it as `next_digit`.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `ticket` remains the same.
- `total_sum` remains even.
- `target_sum` remains `total_sum // 2`.
- `curr_sum` is updated to include the value of `next_digit`.
- `segments` remains 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`ticket` is a string consisting of \( n \) digits where \( 2 \le n \le 100 \), `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is the previous `curr_sum` plus the value of the next digit in `ticket`, and `segments` remains 0.**
