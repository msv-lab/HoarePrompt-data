`curr_sum` is updated by adding the value of `digit` to it. The value of `digit` is added to the original value of `curr_sum`. Therefore, the new value of `curr_sum` is the original value of `curr_sum` plus the value of `digit`. The variable `digit` and the variable `segments` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_sum` is the original value of `curr_sum` plus the value of `digit`, `digit` is the next digit in `ticket`, and `segments` remains unchanged.**
