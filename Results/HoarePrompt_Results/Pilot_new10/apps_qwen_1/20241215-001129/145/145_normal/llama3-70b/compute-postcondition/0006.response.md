The code `segments = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `segments`. This initializes `segments` to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ticket` is a string consisting of $n$ digits where $2 \le n \le 100$ and each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive; `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even; `target_sum` is total_sum // 2; `curr_sum` is 0; `segments` is 0.
