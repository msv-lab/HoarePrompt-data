The line `current_sum = 0` assigns the value 0 to `current_sum`. This overrides the previous value of `current_sum`, which was `0 + int(ticket[0])`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `ticket`, `target_sum`, `segment_count`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0])`, `segment_count` is 0**.
