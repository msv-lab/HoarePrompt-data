Initially, `current_sum` is 0, and the code snippet sets `current_sum` to 0 again. This means that `current_sum` does not change from its initial value.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0])`, and `segment_count` is 2 if `current_sum` equals `target_sum`. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.**
