The value of `segment_count` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `segment_count` is 2.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and n > 3, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 2**
