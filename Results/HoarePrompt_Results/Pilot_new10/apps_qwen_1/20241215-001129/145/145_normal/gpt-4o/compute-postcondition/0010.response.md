According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `i` and the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`. At the end of the last iteration, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is an integer within the specified range, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

Since there are no other conditions or changes mentioned for `n`, `ticket`, `target_sum`, `current_sum`, and `segment_count`, these variables remain unchanged.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`**.
