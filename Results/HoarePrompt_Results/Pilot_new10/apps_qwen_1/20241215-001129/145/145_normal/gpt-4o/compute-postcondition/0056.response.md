`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The value of `segment_count` was initially 0, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0])`, `segment_count` is 1**
