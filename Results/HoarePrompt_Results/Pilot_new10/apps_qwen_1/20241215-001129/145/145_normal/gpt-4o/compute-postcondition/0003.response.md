The variable `segment_count` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`n`, `ticket`, `target_sum`, and `current_sum`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and `n` must be greater than 1, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive; `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0**
