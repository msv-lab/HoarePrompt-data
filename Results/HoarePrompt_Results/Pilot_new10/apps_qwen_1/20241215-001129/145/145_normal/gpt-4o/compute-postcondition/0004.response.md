According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `n-1`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the initial values and conditions of the variables involved.

1. **Variable `i`:** The loop will start with `i` being 0 and will increment by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n`. Therefore, initially, `i` should be set to 0.
   
2. **Variable `n`:** It is already given that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `n` must be greater than 1. This condition is already met as per the problem statement, so no adjustment is needed here other than acknowledging its value within the specified range.

3. **Variables `ticket` and `segment_count`:** These variables are not directly affected by the loop itself but are relevant for the context of the problem. `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits, and `segment_count` is a variable that may be updated during the loop's execution. Since the question asks us to adjust the states necessary for the loop to execute, we do not need to specify these explicitly unless they affect the loop's continuation or the loop body.

4. **Variables `current_sum` and `target_sum`:** Initially, `current_sum` is set to 0, and `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`. The value of `target_sum` does not affect the loop's execution, but `current_sum` should remain 0 before entering the loop.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` must be 0.
- `n` must be within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and greater than 1 (this is already given).

The final state before the loop is:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 0**
