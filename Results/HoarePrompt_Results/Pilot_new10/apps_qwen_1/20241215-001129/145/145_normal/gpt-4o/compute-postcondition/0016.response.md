`current_sum` is incremented by the integer value of `ticket[i]`. Since `i` is 4, we need to find the value of the 5th character in the string `ticket` (remember, indexing starts from 0). However, the exact value of `ticket` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `current_sum`. But we know that `current_sum` is increased by the integer value of the 5th digit in `ticket`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and n > 3, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is increased by the integer value of the 5th digit in `ticket`, `segment_count` is 1**
