Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `current_sum` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
   - `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive
   - `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`
   - `segment_count` is 2
   - `segment_length` is `n`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **What Changes in Each Iteration:**
   - `i` increases by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 3.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
   - There is no indication that `n`, `ticket`, `target_sum`, `segment_count`, or `segment_length` change within the loop based on the given information.
   - `current_sum` remains unchanged unless there is a loop body that modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume it does not change.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - Therefore, `n` must remain within its range \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`current_sum` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `segment_length` digits of `ticket`, `segment_count` is 2, and `segment_length` is `n`.**
