`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The original value of `segment_count` was 1, so it is now 2. The states of the other variables (`current_sum`, `i`, `n`, `ticket`, and `target_sum`) are not affected.

Output State: **`current_sum` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0])`, and `segment_count` is 2**
