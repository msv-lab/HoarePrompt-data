Postcondition: `current_sum` is either the sum of all digits in `ticket` or 0 depending on whether any segment sum matches `target_sum`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, and `segment_count` is the number of segments where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`. Additionally, `current_sum` is not 0 or `segment_count` is not greater than 1.
