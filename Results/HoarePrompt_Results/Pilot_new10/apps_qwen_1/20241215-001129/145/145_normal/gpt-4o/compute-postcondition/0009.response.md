Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, `current_sum` is reset to the first digit of `ticket` and `segment_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_sum` remains unchanged and `segment_count` remains unchanged.***
