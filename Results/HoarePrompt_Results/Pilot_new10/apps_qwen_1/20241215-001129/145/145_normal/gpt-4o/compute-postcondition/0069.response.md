Postcondition: **`current_sum` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0])`, `segment_count` is greater than 1, and `current_sum` equals `target_sum` more than once during the loop execution**
