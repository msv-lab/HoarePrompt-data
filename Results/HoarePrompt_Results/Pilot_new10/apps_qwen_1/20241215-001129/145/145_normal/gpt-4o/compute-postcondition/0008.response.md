`segment_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `segment_count` is 0, so it is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ticket` is a string consisting of `n` digits where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `target_sum` is the result of the function `segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1**
