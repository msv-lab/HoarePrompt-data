`queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the string `new_state_str` to the list `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 0 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`, `new_state_str` is added to the set `visited`, `queue` contains `new_state_str`.**
