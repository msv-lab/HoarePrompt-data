The code swaps the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list. From the initial state, we know:

- `empty_row` is 0
- `empty_col` is 1
- `new_row` is `dr`
- `new_col` is `dc + 1`
- `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`

Since `empty_pos` is determined by the position of the empty tile (which is at `(empty_row, empty_col)`), it would be `0 * 2 + 1 = 1` (since the list index starts from 0). Therefore, `empty_pos` is 1.

Given `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, the new state swaps the elements at index 1 (which was `empty_pos`) and index `new_pos`.

Let's summarize the updated values:

- `new_state[1]` and `new_state[dr * 2 + dc + 1]` are swapped.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is not in `visited`.**
