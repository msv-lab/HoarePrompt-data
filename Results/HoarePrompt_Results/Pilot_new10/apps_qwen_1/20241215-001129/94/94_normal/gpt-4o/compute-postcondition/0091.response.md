Postcondition: ***`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list containing at least one pair of values, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, the `new_state` is updated to move the empty position to `(new_row, new_col)`, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, which is now updated, `visited` contains `new_state_str`, and `queue` contains `new_state_str`. If `new_state_str` is in `visited`, the program does nothing.***
