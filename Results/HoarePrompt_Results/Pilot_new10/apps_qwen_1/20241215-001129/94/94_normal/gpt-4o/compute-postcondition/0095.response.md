The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` updates the value of `new_pos`. According to the initial state, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. The calculation for `new_pos` is directly dependent on these values. Since the values of `dr` and `dc` are not specified, they remain as they are.

The updated value of `new_pos` is calculated as follows:
- `new_pos = (empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`

Therefore, the `new_pos` is updated to this expression, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the first pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`**
