Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a string `start` representing a 2 × 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle, where the positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', and the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible moves of the empty tile and keeps track of all unique states encountered. The function returns a set containing all these unique states.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
- The function accepts a specific format of a string representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 puzzle.
- It uses a breadth-first search approach to explore all possible moves of the empty tile.
- It maintains a set of visited states to ensure no state is revisited.
- It returns a set containing all unique states encountered during the exploration process.
