The line of code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This operation does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`current` is the next element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the next pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state`, and `visited` contains the string representation of `new_state`.**
