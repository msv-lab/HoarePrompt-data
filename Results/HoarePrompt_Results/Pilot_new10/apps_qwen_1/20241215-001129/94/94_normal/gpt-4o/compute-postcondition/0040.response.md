Let's break down the given while loop and the current state step by step to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given:
- The loop condition: `while queue:` 
- Current state:
  - `current` is the final state of the puzzle
  - `queue` is an empty deque
  - `visited` is a set containing all unique states visited during the process
  - `directions` is `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`
  - `empty_pos` is the index of the 'X' in `current`
  - `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2
  - `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `queue` is not empty.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `queue` is an empty deque.

### Conclusion:
Since `queue` is currently empty, the condition `while queue:` is false, meaning the loop cannot execute again unless `queue` is no longer empty.

### Adjustment Needed:
To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `queue` is non-empty at the start of the next iteration.

### Final State:
- Ensure `queue` is non-empty.
- Other states (`current`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`) do not need adjustment because they are not relevant to the loop condition.

**State:** **`queue` must contain at least one element**
