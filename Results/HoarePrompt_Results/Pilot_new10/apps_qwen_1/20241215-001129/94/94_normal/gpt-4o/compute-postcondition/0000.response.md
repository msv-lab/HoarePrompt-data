The code initializes a queue with the `start` value, which is a string representing a 2 × 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The `queue` is a deque (double-ended queue) data structure that contains the `start` state.

Output State: **`start` is a string representing a 2 × 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle; `queue` is a deque containing the single element `start`.**
