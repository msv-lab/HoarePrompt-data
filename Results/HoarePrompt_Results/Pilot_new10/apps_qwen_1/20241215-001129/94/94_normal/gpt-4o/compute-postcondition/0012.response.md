Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `current` is `start`
   - `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed
   - `visited` is a set containing the element `start`
   - `directions` must be non-empty
   - `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`
   - `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2
   - `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2
   - `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`
   - `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`
   - `new_state` is a list copy of `current`

2. The code snippet:
   ```python
   new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos]
   ```

   This line swaps the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `new_state`.

3. The `new_pos` is calculated as `dr * new_row + dc * new_col`, where `dr` and `dc` are the direction row and column respectively.

4. After the swap, the values of `current`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_state` remain unchanged, except for `new_state` which now has the swapped values.

5. The output state is:
   - `current` is `start`
   - `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed
   - `visited` is a set containing the element `start`
   - `directions` must be non-empty
   - `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2
   - `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2
   - `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`
   - `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`
   - `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped

Output State: **`current` is `start`; `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed; `visited` is a set containing the element `start`; `directions` must be non-empty; `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
