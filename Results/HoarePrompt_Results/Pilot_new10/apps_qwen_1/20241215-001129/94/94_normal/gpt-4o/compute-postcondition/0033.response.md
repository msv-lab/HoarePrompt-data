Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `current` is the current state
   - `queue` contains the elements of the previous queue
   - `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far
   - `directions` must be non-empty
   - `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2
   - `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2
   - `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`
   - `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`
   - `new_pos` is `2 * empty_row + 2 * dr + empty_col + dc`
   - `new_pos` is also `new_row * 2 + new_col`
   - `new_state` is a list of `current`

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos]
   ```

   This line swaps the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `new_state` list.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The value at `new_state[empty_pos]` is moved to `new_state[new_pos]`.
   - The value at `new_state[new_pos]` is moved to `new_state[empty_pos]`.

4. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
   - The `new_state` list is updated with the swapped values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` contains the elements of the previous queue, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `2 * empty_row + 2 * dr + empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is also `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of `current` with the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.**
