Postcondition: ***`current` is `start`, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, and `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far. If `new_row` and `new_col` are within bounds (0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2), and the new state represented by `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`, and `visited` includes `new_state_str`. Otherwise, the program continues without updating `queue` or `visited`. `directions` must be non-empty; `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.***
