The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` concatenates the elements of the list `new_state` into a single string, using no delimiter. This operation does not change the elements of `new_state` but creates a new string from its contents. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions `1` and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`.**
