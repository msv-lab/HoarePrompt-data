The code assigns the new row and column positions based on the `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` values. The variables `current`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` remain unchanged.

Let's denote the changes:
- `new_row = empty_row + dr`
- `new_col = empty_col + dc`

The output state will reflect these new values for `new_row` and `new_col`, while the other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.**
