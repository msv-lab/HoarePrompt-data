Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was accurate because the program indeed contains an error in how it processes the puzzle states. The function `func_1` incorrectly merges the rows of the puzzle into a single string, which results in losing the column information. This flawed representation leads to incorrect state tracking in the breadth-first search performed by `func_2`. As a result, the program cannot accurately determine if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration.

The annotated version of the code confirms this issue, showing that `func_1` returns a single string rather than a tuple of strings representing the rows. This misrepresentation of the puzzle state causes the program to fail in its goal of determining if the puzzles can be brought to the same configuration. Therefore, keeping the original assessment of **False** is justified.
