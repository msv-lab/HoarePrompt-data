The function `func_2` accepts a string `start` representing a 2 Ã— 2 grid configuration of Bessie's puzzle, where the positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', and the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It uses a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible moves of the empty tile and keeps track of all unique states encountered. The function returns a set containing all these unique states.
