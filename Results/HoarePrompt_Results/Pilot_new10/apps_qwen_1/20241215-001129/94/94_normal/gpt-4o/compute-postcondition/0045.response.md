The code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col` by adding the values of `dr` and `dc` to `empty_row` and `empty_col`, respectively. Since the initial values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are 0 and 1, respectively, the values of `new_row` and `new_col` will be `dr` and `dc + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1**
