The code `''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of the `new_state` list into a string. This does not change the content of `new_state` itself, but it does assign the resulting string to `new_state_str`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` is now equal to the result of `'' .join(new_state)`.**
