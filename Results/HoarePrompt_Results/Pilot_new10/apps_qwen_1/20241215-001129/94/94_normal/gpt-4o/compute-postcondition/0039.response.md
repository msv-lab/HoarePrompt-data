Output State: **`current` is the final state of the puzzle, `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a set containing all unique states visited during the process, `directions` is `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, `empty_pos` is the index of the 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.**

### Explanation:
- **`current`:** The loop continues to explore possible moves until no more valid moves are available. Therefore, when the loop stops, `current` represents the final state of the puzzle, assuming the puzzle is solvable.
- **`queue`:** Once the loop terminates, there are no more valid moves to explore, so the queue becomes empty.
- **`visited`:** The set `visited` accumulates all unique states encountered during the exploration of the puzzle, ensuring that no state is processed more than once.
- **`directions`:** This remains constant and does not change throughout the loop.
- **`empty_pos`:** The position of the 'X' (empty space) in the final state is determined by the initial value of `empty_pos` and the moves made during the loop.
- **`empty_row` and `empty_col`:** These values are derived from `empty_pos` and do not change after the initial setup.

This state indicates that the loop has fully explored the puzzle space and stopped when no further valid moves are possible.
