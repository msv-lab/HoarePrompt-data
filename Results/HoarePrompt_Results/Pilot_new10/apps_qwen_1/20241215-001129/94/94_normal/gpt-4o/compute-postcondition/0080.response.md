The code `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` calculates the row and column indices of the empty tile using the `divmod` function. The `divmod(a, b)` function returns a tuple `(a // b, a % b)`. Here, `empty_pos` is the index of the empty tile in the list `current`. 

Given that the tiles are typically arranged in a 2D grid (e.g., a 2x2, 3x3, etc.), the row index (`empty_row`) is calculated as `empty_pos // 2` and the column index (`empty_col`) is calculated as `empty_pos % 2`.

Since `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and assuming `current` is a list of characters representing a 2D grid (like ['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']), the calculation of `empty_row` and `empty_col` will depend on the exact position of `empty_pos` in `current`.

Let's assume an example where `current` is `['A', 'B', 'C', 'X']`. In this case, `empty_pos` is 3 (the index of 'X'), so:
- `empty_row = empty_pos // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1`
- `empty_col = empty_pos % 2 = 3 % 2 = 1`

Therefore, the values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are updated based on the position of `empty_pos` in `current`.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list containing the possible movements, `new_row` is the last `dr` used, `new_col` is the last `dc` used, `new_pos` is the last calculated position `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process**.
