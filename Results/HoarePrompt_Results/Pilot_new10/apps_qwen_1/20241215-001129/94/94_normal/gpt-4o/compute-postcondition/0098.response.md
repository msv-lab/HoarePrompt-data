The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` concatenates the elements of the list `new_state` into a single string `new_state_str`. This operation does not change the elements of `new_state` but creates a new string representation of `new_state`.

- The original `current` remains unchanged as it was only used to create `new_state`.
- `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `empty_pos`, `directions`, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` also remain unchanged.
- `new_state` is updated to its new configuration, but `new_state_str` is a new string representation of this state.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and the newly created string representation.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the first pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`.**
