The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of `new_state` to the set `visited`. This does not change the values of any variables except `visited`, which gains the new element `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a copy of `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is the string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `new_state_str` is now equal to the result of `'' .join(new_state)`, `visited` contains `new_state_str`.**
