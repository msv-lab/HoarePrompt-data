The code `empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)` divides `empty_pos` by 2 and assigns the quotient to `empty_row` and the remainder to `empty_col`. Since `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and assuming `current` is a list with even-indexed positions, `divmod(empty_pos, 2)` will give the row and column indices of the 'X' position.

Given that `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and assuming `current` is a 2D list where each element's index is calculated as `row * 2 + col` (since `divmod` is used with base 2), the value of `empty_pos` will determine the exact row and column.

For example, if `current` is a 2D list represented as a 1D list, and `empty_pos` is 2, then:
- `divmod(2, 2)` would yield `(1, 0)`, meaning `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 0.

However, without the actual content of `current`, we can only express the output state in terms of the operations performed:

Output State: **`current` is `start`, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`, `directions` is `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.**
