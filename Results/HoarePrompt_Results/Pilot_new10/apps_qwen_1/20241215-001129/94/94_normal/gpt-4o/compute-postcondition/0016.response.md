The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. No other variables are affected. 

- `current` remains `start`.
- `queue` is updated by appending `new_state_str` to the deque.
- `visited` remains a set containing `start` and `new_state_str`.
- `directions` remains non-empty.
- `empty_row` remains the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `empty_col` remains the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `new_row` remains `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` remains `empty_col + dc`.
- `new_state` remains a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped.
- `new_state_str` remains a string representation of the list `new_state`.

Output State: **`current` is `start`; `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed plus `new_state_str`; `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str`; `directions` must be non-empty; `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state`.**
