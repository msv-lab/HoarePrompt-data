To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to follow the given logic step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `current` is the current state.
   - `queue` contains the elements of the previous queue.
   - `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far.
   - `directions` must be non-empty.
   - `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
   - `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
   - `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
   - `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.
   - `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\).
   - If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` contains the previous elements plus `new_state_str`, and `visited` includes `new_state_str`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Body Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each direction `(dr, dc)` in `directions`.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `directions` must still be non-empty. This means there must be at least one direction left to process.

Given these points, let's analyze the states:

- `current`: This state does not change within the loop; it remains as the current state.
- `queue`: This set could potentially change if a new state is added to it during the loop execution.
- `visited`: This set could also change if a new state is added to it during the loop execution.
- `directions`: This must remain non-empty for the loop to continue.
- `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`: These values depend on the `directions` and the current state but do not change the condition for the loop to continue.
- `new_state_str`: This is determined based on the `directions` and other state values, and its inclusion in `visited` affects the `queue`.

Since the only condition for the loop to continue is that `directions` must be non-empty, and assuming that the loop body does not modify this condition, the only thing that needs to be ensured for the loop to continue is that `directions` is non-empty.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` contains the elements of the previous queue, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\)**.
