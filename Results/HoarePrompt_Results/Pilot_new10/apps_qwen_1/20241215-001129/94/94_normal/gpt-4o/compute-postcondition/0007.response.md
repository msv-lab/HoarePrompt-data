To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `current`: This is the current grid or configuration, starting from the position `start`.
- `queue`: A deque containing elements after the leftmost element is removed.
- `visited`: A set containing the element `start`.
- `directions`: A list of possible directions for movement: `[(−1, 0), (1, 0), (0, −1), (0, 1)]`.
- `empty_pos`: The index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row`: The quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `empty_col`: The remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.

### For Loop:
```
for (dr, dc) in directions:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each direction in `directions`. There is no explicit condition given in the for loop that depends on the state of `queue`, `visited`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, or `empty_col`.

2. **Dependencies**: The loop itself does not depend on `queue`, `visited`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, or `empty_col` for its execution. It only iterates over the pre-defined list `directions`.

3. **Initialization and Execution**: Since the loop will always iterate over all directions in `directions`, as long as `directions` is non-empty, the loop will execute.

4. **Adjustments Needed**: The states `queue`, `visited`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are part of the overall state of the problem but are not conditions for the loop to execute. They remain unchanged within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The loop will always execute as long as there are directions to iterate over. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for these states to ensure the loop executes.

### Final Answer:
State: **No adjustments needed. The loop will execute as long as `directions` is non-empty.** 

However, if we strictly follow the format requested, we would state:

State: **`current` is `start`, `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2**.
