The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the `new_state_str` to the set `visited`. This means that the string representation of the new state is now included in the `visited` set. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` has at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions 1 and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, `new_state_str` is in `visited`**
