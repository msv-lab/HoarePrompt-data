The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of the list `new_state` into a single string. Since the elements of `new_state` are characters, this operation will create a string representation of `new_state`. The original values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list containing at least one pair of values, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current`, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` (now updated), `visited` is a set containing all unique states encountered during the process, and `(0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2)` is true.**
