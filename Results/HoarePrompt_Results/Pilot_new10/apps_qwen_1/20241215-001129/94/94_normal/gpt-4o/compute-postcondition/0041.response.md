`current` is assigned the value that was at the front of the queue (removed using `popleft()`), which means the first element in the queue is now assigned to `current`. The length of the queue is reduced by one. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`current` is the value that was at the front of the queue; the queue's length is reduced by one.**
