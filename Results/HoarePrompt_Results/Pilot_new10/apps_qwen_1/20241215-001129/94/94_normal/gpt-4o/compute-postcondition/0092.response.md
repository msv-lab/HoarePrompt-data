Postcondition: ***`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list containing at least one pair of values, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, `new_pos` is `(new_row) * 2 + new_col`, and the program updates `new_state` to move the empty position to `(new_row, new_col)`, sets `new_state_str` to a string created by joining the elements of `new_state`, adds `new_state_str` to `visited`, and adds `new_state_str` to `queue` if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`. If `new_row` or `new_col` is out of bounds, the program does nothing.***
