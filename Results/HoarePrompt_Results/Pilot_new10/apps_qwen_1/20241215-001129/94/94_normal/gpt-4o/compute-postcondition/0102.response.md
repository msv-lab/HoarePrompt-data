Postcondition: ***`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the first pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`. If `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of the 2x2 grid (i.e., 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2), then the function checks if the new state (`new_state_str`) created by swapping the empty tile with the neighboring tile does not exist in `visited`. If it doesn't exist, `new_state_str` is added to both `visited` and `queue`. If it already exists, the state remains unchanged.***
