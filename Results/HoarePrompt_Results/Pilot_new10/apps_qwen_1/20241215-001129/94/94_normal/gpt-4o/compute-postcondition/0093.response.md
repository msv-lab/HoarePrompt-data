Let's analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `current` is the first element of the queue.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `directions` is a list containing at least one pair of values.
- `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for (dr, dc) in directions:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `directions` list. Since `directions` contains at least one pair of values, it means the loop can execute at least once.
2. **Variables Updated Inside the Loop**:
   - `new_row` is updated to `empty_row + dr`.
   - `new_col` is updated to `empty_col + dc`.
   - If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then:
     - `new_pos` is calculated as `(new_row) * 2 + new_col`.
     - A new state (`new_state`) is created by moving the empty position to `(new_row, new_col)`.
     - `new_state_str` is created by joining the elements of `new_state`.
     - `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` if it is not already in `visited`.

### State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- Since the loop can execute again as long as `directions` contains at least one pair of values, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the current state of `directions`. Specifically, we need to remove the first pair of values from `directions` since it has been used in the previous iteration.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `current` remains the same as it is part of the queue and not modified inside the loop.
- `empty_row` remains the same as it is derived from `empty_pos` which is unchanged.
- `empty_col` remains the same for the same reason.
- `empty_pos` remains the same.
- `directions` should now be the list of remaining pairs after removing the first one.

### Final Answer:
State: **`current` is the first element of the queue, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `directions` is a list of pairs excluding the first pair, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`.**

Note: The exact value of `new_row` and `new_col` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `dr` and `dc` from the first pair of `directions`.
