The code snippet `queue.append(new_state_str)` appends the `new_state_str` to the `queue`. This operation modifies the `queue` by adding the `new_state_str` to its end. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`current` is the current state, `queue` contains the elements of the previous queue plus `new_state_str`, `visited` is a set containing the elements seen so far including `new_state_str`, `directions` must be non-empty, `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is \(2 \times empty_row + 2 \times dr + empty_col + dc\), `new_state` is a list version of `current` where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, `new_state_str` is a string created by joining the elements of `new_state` with no separator, `queue` contains the previous elements plus `new_state_str`.**
