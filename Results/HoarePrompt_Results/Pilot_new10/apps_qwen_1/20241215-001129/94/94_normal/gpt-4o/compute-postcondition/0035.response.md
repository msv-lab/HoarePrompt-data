`visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the string `new_state_str`, which is formed by joining the elements of the `new_state` list, to the set `visited`. The set `visited` is updated with this new string, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states; `new_state_str` is the string formed by joining the elements of the `new_state` list; `visited` contains the new string `new_state_str`**
