The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the elements of the list `new_state` into a string. Since `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped, the actual content of `new_state` is not specified in the initial state, but we know that `new_state` is different from `current` only at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current` is `start`; `queue` is a deque containing the elements after the leftmost element is removed; `visited` is a set containing the element `start`; `directions` must be non-empty; `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`; `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`; `new_state` is a list copy of `current` but with the elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` swapped; `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state` obtained by joining its elements.**
