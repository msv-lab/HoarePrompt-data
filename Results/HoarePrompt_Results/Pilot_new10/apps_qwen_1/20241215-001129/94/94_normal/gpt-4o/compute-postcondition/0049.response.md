The code swaps the values at `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]`. Given the initial state:

- `current` is a list with a reduced length by one.
- `empty_row` is 0.
- `empty_col` is 1.
- `directions` must have at least one element.
- `new_row` is `dr`.
- `new_col` is `dc + 1`.
- `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`.
- `new_state` is a list equal to `current`.

Let's determine the values of `empty_pos` and `new_pos`:
- `empty_pos` should be `empty_row * 2 + empty_col`, which is `0 * 2 + 1 = 1`.
- `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, which is `dr * 2 + (dc + 1)`.

The code swaps `new_state[1]` and `new_state[dr * 2 + dc + 1]`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `current` remains unchanged (a list with a reduced length by one).
- `empty_row` remains 0.
- `empty_col` remains 1.
- `directions` remains having at least one element.
- `new_row` remains `dr`.
- `new_col` remains `dc + 1`.
- `new_pos` remains `dr * 2 + dc + 1`.
- `new_state` is now the list `current` with the elements at positions `1` and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped.

Output State: **`current` is a list with a reduced length by one, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `directions` must have at least one element, `new_row` is `dr`, `new_col` is `dc + 1`, `new_pos` is `dr * 2 + dc + 1`, `new_state` is a list equal to `current` with the elements at positions `1` and `dr * 2 + dc + 1` swapped.**
