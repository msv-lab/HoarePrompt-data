The function accepts two parameters `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, which are strings representing the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. It finds the index of the empty cell ('X') in both puzzles, swaps the contents of these positions, and returns `True` if the sorted versions of the two puzzles are equal, otherwise it returns `False`.
