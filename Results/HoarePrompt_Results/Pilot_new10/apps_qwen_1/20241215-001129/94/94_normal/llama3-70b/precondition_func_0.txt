puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings representing the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles, respectively. Each string consists of four characters, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' represent tiles, and 'X' represents the empty cell. Each string guarantees exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.
