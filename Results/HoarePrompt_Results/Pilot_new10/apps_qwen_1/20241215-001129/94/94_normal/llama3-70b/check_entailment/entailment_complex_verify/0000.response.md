Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` only swaps the positions of the empty cell ('X') between the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted representations of the puzzles are equal. This approach is indeed flawed because it only considers a single swap and does not account for all possible sequences of moves. As explained in the original assessment, this leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios, such as the examples provided. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.
