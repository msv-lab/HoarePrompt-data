Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles can reach the same configuration. The function `func_1` simply swaps the positions of the empty cells in both puzzles and checks if the resulting configurations are lexicographically the same. This approach does not consider the actual movements of the tiles, which are crucial for determining if the puzzles can be brought to the same state through valid moves.

To illustrate why the code is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
AB
XC
XB
AC
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the code incorrectly determines that the puzzles cannot be brought to the same configuration because it only checks if the sorted configurations are the same, ignoring the movement constraints. The correct solution would involve checking all possible sequences of valid moves to see if the puzzles can reach the same configuration.

The provided code fails to account for the fact that certain configurations may not be reachable due to the constraints of the puzzle (i.e., tiles can only slide into the empty space). Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
