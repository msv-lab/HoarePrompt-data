#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are strings representing the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles, respectively. Each string consists of four characters, where 'A', 'B', and 'C' represent tiles, and 'X' represents the empty cell. Each string guarantees exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 3, `x1` is 3, `x2` is 3.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True if the sorted values of puzzle1 and puzzle2 are equal, given that both puzzle1 and puzzle2 initially contain [3, 3, 3]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, which are strings representing the initial configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. It finds the index of the empty cell ('X') in both puzzles, swaps the contents of these positions, and returns `True` if the sorted versions of the two puzzles are equal, otherwise it returns `False`.
