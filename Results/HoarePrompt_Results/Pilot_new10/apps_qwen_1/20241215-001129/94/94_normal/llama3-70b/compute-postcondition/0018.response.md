The code swaps the values of `puzzle1[x1]` and `puzzle2[x2]`. Given the initial state where `x1` is 3 and `x2` is 3, this means that `puzzle1[3]` and `puzzle2[3]` are swapped. However, since the values of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` at index 3 are not provided, we cannot specify what those values are. The only variables that are affected are `x1` and `x2`, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `x1` is 3, `x2` is 3**
