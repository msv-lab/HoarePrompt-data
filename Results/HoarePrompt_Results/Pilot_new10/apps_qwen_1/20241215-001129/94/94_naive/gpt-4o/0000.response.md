Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by generating all reachable states from the initial configurations for both Bessie and Elsie using breadth-first search (BFS). However, there is a critical issue with the `func_1` function, which concatenates the rows of the puzzle into a single string. This approach fails to preserve the grid structure, leading to incorrect state representations.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
AB
XC
AC
XB
```

- For Bessie's puzzle, `func_1` will convert `["AB", "XC"]` to `"ABXC"`.
- For Elsie's puzzle, `func_1` will convert `["AC", "XB"]` to `"ACXB"`.

These strings cannot be used to accurately represent the grid states, as the relative positions of the tiles are lost. Therefore, the reachable states generated by `func_2` will not correspond to valid grid configurations, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should keep the state representation as a 2x2 grid rather than a single string. This way, the relative positions of the tiles are preserved, and the BFS can correctly explore all possible configurations.
