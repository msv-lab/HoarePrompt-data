Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the number itself is already divisible by \(10^k\) but has leading zeros that need to be removed. Specifically, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1000 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

The program attempts to repeatedly divide `n` by 10 until it is divisible by \(10^k\), incrementing the count `w` each time. However, it does not account for the scenario where `n` is already divisible by \(10^k\) but has leading zeros. In the example above, `1000` is divisible by \(10^3 = 1000\), but the program incorrectly counts three divisions, effectively removing all digits, instead of just one division to remove the leading zeros.

To fix this, the program should check if the number is already divisible by \(10^k\) and count only the trailing zeros that need to be removed. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n > 0 and n % 10 == 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    if n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += len(str(n)) - len(str(n).rstrip('0')) + k - 1
    print(w)
```

This version correctly handles cases where the number is already divisible by \(10^k\) and only counts the necessary trailing zeros.
