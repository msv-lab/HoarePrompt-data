The code `n //= 10` divides `n` by 10 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 20,000,000 inclusive and is not divisible by \(10^k\) (where \(k\) is some integer), after dividing `n` by 10, `n` will still be an integer within the range but will be reduced by a factor of 10. Additionally, `w` is increased by 1.

Given that `n` was initially between 0 and 20,000,000 and not divisible by \(10^k\), after the operation, `n` will be between 0 and 2,000,000 and will also not be divisible by \(10^k\) (since it's just divided by 10). The variable `w` will now be increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 2,000,000 inclusive and still not divisible by \(10^k\); `w` is increased by 1**
