The code reads two space-separated integers `n` and `k` from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `n` and `k` are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial state does not specify the actual values of `n` and `k`, but they are guaranteed to meet the given conditions: `0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 9`.

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` are known integers that satisfy the specified conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive; `k` is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.**
