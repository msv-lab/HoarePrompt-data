The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on input from standard input (stdin) in the form of two space-separated integers `n` and `k`, where `0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 9`, and guarantees that the answer exists. 

Based on the input values of `n` and `k`, the function processes the input and returns a value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept input from standard input in the form of two space-separated integers `n` and `k`, and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts input from standard input in the form of two space-separated integers `n` and `k`, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
