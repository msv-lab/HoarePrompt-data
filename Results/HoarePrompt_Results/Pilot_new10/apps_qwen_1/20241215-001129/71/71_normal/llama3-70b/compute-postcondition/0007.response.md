`n` is divided by 10 using integer division, reducing its value by a factor of 10. The original condition is that `n` is an integer between 0 and 200,000,000 inclusive and not divisible by 10. After the operation, `n` will still be within the range but will no longer be guaranteed to not be divisible by 10 because it has been divided by 10. However, since `n` was not divisible by 10 before the operation and is now divided by 10, it still won't be divisible by 10 (since dividing by 10 once removes the last digit which was non-zero).

`w` is incremented by 1 in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 20,000,000 inclusive and still not divisible by 10; `w` is increased by 1**
