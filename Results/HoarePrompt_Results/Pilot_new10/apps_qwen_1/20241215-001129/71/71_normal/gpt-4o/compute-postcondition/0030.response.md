Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`, `to_remove` is the number of digits removed from the string `n` up to the point where either `count_zeros` reaches `k` or the loop does not execute, and if `count_zeros` equals `k`, the function prints the value of `to_remove`; otherwise, the function outputs `len(n) - 1`.***
