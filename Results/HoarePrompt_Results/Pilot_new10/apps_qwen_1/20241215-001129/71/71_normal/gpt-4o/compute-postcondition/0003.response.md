The variable `to_remove` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `count_zeros`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0**
