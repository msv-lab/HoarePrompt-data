Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program focuses on counting zeros and determining the number of digits to remove to get at least `k` zeros, rather than ensuring the resulting number is divisible by \(10^k\).

#### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program checks for the presence of `k` zeros in the number and prints the number of digits removed to achieve this. However, the goal is to make the number divisible by \(10^k\), not just contain `k` zeros.
   
2. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle cases where no zeros are present in the number. For instance, in the example `10203049 2`, the number of zeros is less than 2, and the program incorrectly prints `3` instead of handling it according to the rules.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Zeros**: The program assumes that having `k` zeros will make the number divisible by \(10^k\). This is not necessarily true. For example, in the number `1000000001`, there are more than 2 zeros, but removing them does not make the number divisible by \(10^2\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the resulting number ends with at least `k` zeros. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    
    # Remove all characters except the last k zeros and count the number of digits to remove
    for i in range(len(str(n)) - 1, -1, -1):
        if str(n)[i] == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
            if count_zeros == k:
                break
        else:
            to_remove += 1
    
    # If we have at least k zeros, print the number of digits to remove
    if count_zeros >= k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        # If not, remove all but the last k zeros and count the digits to remove
        for i in range(len(str(n)) - 1, -1, -1):
            if str(n)[i] == '0':
                count_zeros += 1
            else:
                to_remove += 1
            if count_zeros == k:
                break
        print(to_remove)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Counting Zeros**: We iterate from the end of the number to find the first `k` zeros.
2. **Count Digits to Remove**: We count the digits to remove to achieve the desired condition.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the number does not have enough zeros, we continue to remove digits until we reach the desired condition.

By following these steps, the program ensures that the resulting number is divisible by \(10^k\) and prints the minimum number of digits to remove.
