Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string with the rightmost digit removed, `k` is an integer, and `count_zeros` is either 2 or 3 depending on the initial value and the new rightmost digit. `to_remove` is either 1 or 2 based on the new rightmost digit. If `count_zeros == k`, then the condition holds true as per the if part. Otherwise, no change occurs since there is no else part provided.***
