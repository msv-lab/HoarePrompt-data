To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can run. Specifically, the loop will execute if the string `n` is not empty.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for digit in reversed(n)` iterates over each character in the string `n` in reverse order.
2. For the loop to execute, the string `n` must contain at least one character. If `n` is an empty string, the loop will not execute because there are no characters to iterate over.
3. The variables `k`, `count_zeros`, and `to_remove` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute based on the given condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` should be a non-empty string.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 0, `to_remove` is 0**
