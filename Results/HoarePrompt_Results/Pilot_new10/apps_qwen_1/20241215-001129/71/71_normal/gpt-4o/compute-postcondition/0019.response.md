Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each digit in the reversed string `n`. The loop condition depends on whether there are still digits left to process.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is a non-empty string without its rightmost digit.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `count_zeros` is either 2 or 1, depending on the new rightmost digit being '0'.
   - `to_remove` is 2 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', otherwise it is 1.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but since the loop processes the digits of `n` from right to left, the next iteration will process the next digit to the left of the current one.

4. **State Adjustment**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that there is still at least one digit left in `n`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `n` must still be a non-empty string (it currently isn't empty, but it might become empty after processing all digits).
   - `k` remains an integer.
   - `count_zeros` remains either 2 or 1.
   - `to_remove` remains either 2 or 1.

Since the loop will process the next digit to the left, `n` must still contain at least one digit. Therefore, `n` should not be an empty string anymore, meaning it must still have at least one digit left.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is a non-empty string with the rightmost digit removed, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 2 or 1, and `to_remove` is 2 if the new rightmost digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` is 1.**
