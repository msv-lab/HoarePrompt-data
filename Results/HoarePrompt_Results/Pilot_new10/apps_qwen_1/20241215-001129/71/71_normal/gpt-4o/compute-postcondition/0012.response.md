Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the current digit is '0', and `to_remove` is 1 if the current digit is not '0', otherwise `to_remove` remains 0. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.***
