Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the number of zeros in the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`, and `to_remove` is the number of digits removed from the string `n` up to the point where `count_zeros` reaches `k`. If the loop does not execute, `count_zeros` remains 0 and `to_remove` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the digits of the string `n` in reverse order.
- It increments `count_zeros` for each '0' encountered.
- It increments `to_remove` for each non-zero digit encountered.
- The loop breaks when `count_zeros` equals `k`.
- After the loop, `count_zeros` will be the number of zeros encountered until it reached `k`, and `to_remove` will be the number of digits removed (non-zero digits) up to that point.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `k` is 0 or the string `n` does not contain enough zeros), `count_zeros` and `to_remove` will remain 0.
