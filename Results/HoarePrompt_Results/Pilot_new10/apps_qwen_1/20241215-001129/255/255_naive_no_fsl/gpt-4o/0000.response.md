Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Consider the input string `aaabba`. According to the problem description, the optimal way to delete the string is to delete the substring `aaa` first (which takes 1 operation), and then delete the remaining `bba` (which takes 2 more operations). Therefore, the total number of operations should be 3.

However, the program will count the number of different consecutive characters as operations. For the string `aaabba`, the program would count the following:
- From `a` to `a`: no operation needed.
- From `a` to `a`: no operation needed.
- From `a` to `b`: 1 operation (deleting `aaa`).
- From `b` to `b`: no operation needed.
- From `b` to `a`: 1 operation (deleting `bb`).

This results in a total of 2 operations, which is incorrect. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
