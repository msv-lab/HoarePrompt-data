The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 1. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is 2. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is 2. The second character of the string `s` is not equal to the first character of the string `s`.**
