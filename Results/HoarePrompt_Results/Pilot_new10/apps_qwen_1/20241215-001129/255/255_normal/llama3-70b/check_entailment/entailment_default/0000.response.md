Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code simply counts the number of positions where consecutive characters in the string `s` are different. However, this approach does not account for the requirement to delete contiguous substrings where all characters are the same. For example, consider the input "aaaaa". According to the problem description, the correct number of operations needed to delete the entire string is 1 (by deleting the entire substring "aaaaa"). However, the provided code would incorrectly count this as 4 operations because it only checks for consecutive different characters. Therefore, the code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for certain cases.
