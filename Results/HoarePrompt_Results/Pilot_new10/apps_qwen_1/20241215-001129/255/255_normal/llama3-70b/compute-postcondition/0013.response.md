Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided code and initial conditions.

### Initial State
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `n` is the integer length of the string `s`.
- `ans` is 1.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
        ans += 1
```

### Understanding the Loop
- The loop iterates over the characters of the string `s` from index 1 to `n-1`.
- For each character `s[i]`, it checks if it is different from the previous character `s[i-1]`.
- If they are different, `ans` is incremented by 1.

### Analyzing the Output States
#### Output State After the Loop Executes 1 Time
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `ans` is 2 (if `s[1]` is not equal to `s[0]`).

This means the loop has checked whether the second character is different from the first character and incremented `ans` accordingly.

#### Output State After the Loop Executes 2 Times
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `ans` is 3 if `s[2]` is not equal to `s[1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2.

This indicates that the loop has checked the third character against the second character and updated `ans` accordingly.

#### Output State After the Loop Executes 3 Times
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `i` is 4.
- `ans` is 4 if `s[3]` is not equal to `s[2]`. Otherwise, `ans` is 3.

This shows that the loop has checked the fourth character against the third character and updated `ans` accordingly.

### Generalizing the Output State
From the above observations, we can generalize the output state after the loop completes all its iterations:

- The loop will iterate until `i` reaches `n-1`.
- `ans` will be the count of positions where consecutive characters in the string `s` are different.

### Final Output State
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `ans` is the count of positions where consecutive characters in the string `s` are different.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `ans` is the count of positions where consecutive characters in the string `s` are different.**
