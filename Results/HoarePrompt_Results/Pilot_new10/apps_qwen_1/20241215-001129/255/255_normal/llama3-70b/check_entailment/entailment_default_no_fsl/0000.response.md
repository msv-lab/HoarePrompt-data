Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The code simply counts the number of positions where consecutive characters in the string are different. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for contiguous substrings of identical characters that can be deleted. For example, consider the input "aaaaa". The code would output 4, but the correct answer is 1, as we can delete the entire string in one operation. The code fails to handle cases where multiple contiguous substrings of identical characters exist, and it does not perform the required deletion operations.
