Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is the string input by the user.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `ans` is 3 if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive), meaning it starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Hence, `i` will become 4.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, we only need to ensure that `n` remains unchanged or is greater than 4 (since `i` will now be 4).

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the condition `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]` was not specified to change anything else in the current context.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, and `ans` remains 3 if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2.**
