`operations` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]` is also not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]; operations` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i - 1]; operations` is incremented by 1**
