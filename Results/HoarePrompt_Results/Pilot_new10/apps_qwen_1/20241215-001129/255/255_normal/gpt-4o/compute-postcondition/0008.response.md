The code `operations += 1` increments the value of the variable `operations` by 1. Since `operations` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After the operation, `operations` is now 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `operations` is 1**
