The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the given constraints, it implies that the function should inherently handle the parameters `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500) and `s` (a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters), even though they are not explicitly mentioned in the function definition.

Given the output cases described, the function does not return anything directly from the function body but seems to process the parameters internally and might return a value or perform some action based on the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500) and `s` (a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters), and processes them to produce an output.**
