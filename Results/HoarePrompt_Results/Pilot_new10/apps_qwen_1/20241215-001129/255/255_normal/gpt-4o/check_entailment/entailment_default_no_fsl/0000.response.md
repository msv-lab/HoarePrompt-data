Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The code only counts the number of positions where consecutive characters in the string differ, which is not the same as the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string by removing contiguous substrings of identical characters.

For example, consider the string "aaaaa". The provided code would output 1 because there are four positions where consecutive characters differ (i.e., between each pair of 'a' characters). However, the minimum number of operations required to delete the entire string "aaaaa" is actually 1, because we can delete the entire substring "aaaaa" in one operation.

Similarly, for the string "abaca", the code outputs 3, but the correct answer is 3 because we can delete "b", "c", and "a" in three operations, but we cannot achieve the result in fewer operations as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the code does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases.
