`operations` is incremented by 1, changing its value from the initial state. The value of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, and `operations` is incremented by 2.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, and `operations` is incremented by 2**
