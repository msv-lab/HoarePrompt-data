Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the entire string. The logic in the program only counts the number of distinct adjacent characters, which does not account for contiguous substrings of identical characters that span multiple characters.

For example, consider the input:
```
s = "aaabbbccc"
```
The program will output `3` because it sees three distinct adjacent characters (`a`, `b`, and `c`). However, the correct answer should be `3` operations: delete `"aaa"`, then `"bbb"`, and finally `"ccc"`.

The program fails to handle cases where multiple contiguous identical characters exist. To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to identify and count such contiguous substrings.
