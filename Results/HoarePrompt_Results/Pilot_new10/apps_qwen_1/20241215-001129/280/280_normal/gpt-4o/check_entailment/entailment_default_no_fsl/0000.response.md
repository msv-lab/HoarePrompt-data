Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the way the `speeds` list is filled does not guarantee that the speed changes between adjacent seconds do not exceed the given `d` in absolute value. The current implementation uses a simple linear interpolation which may result in speed changes exceeding `d`.

For example, consider the following input:
- `v1 = 5`, `v2 = 9`, `t = 5`, `d = 2`

The correct sequence of speeds should be something like `[5, 7, 9]` or `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` to ensure the speed change between adjacent seconds does not exceed `2`. However, the current implementation might produce a sequence like `[5, 7, 9, 11, 9]`, which violates the constraint since the speed change between the third and fourth seconds is `2` but the speed in the fourth second is `11`, which is greater than `9 + 2`.

To fix this, you would need to use a more sophisticated approach to ensure that the speed changes between adjacent seconds do not exceed `d`. One possible solution could involve using dynamic programming or a similar method to find the optimal sequence of speeds that maximizes the total distance while adhering to the constraints.
