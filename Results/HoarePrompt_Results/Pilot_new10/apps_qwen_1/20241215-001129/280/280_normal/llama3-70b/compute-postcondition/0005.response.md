The code assigns `min_length` the value of `min_speed * t`. Given that `t` is an integer input and `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, the value of `min_length` will be `min_speed * t`.

The other variables (`v1`, `v2`, `d`, `max_speed`, and `max_length`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `v1` is `a`
- `v2` is `b`
- `t` is an integer input
- `d` is an integer input
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b`
- `max_length` is `max_speed * t`
- `min_length` is `min_speed * t`

Output State: **`v1` is `a`, `v2` is `b`, `t` is an integer input, `d` is an integer input, `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `max_length` is `max_speed * t`, `min_length` is `min_speed * t**
