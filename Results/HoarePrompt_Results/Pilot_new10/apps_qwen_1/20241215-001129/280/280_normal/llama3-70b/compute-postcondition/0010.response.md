`min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`. The value of `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, and the value of `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`; `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`**
