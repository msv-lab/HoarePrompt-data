The function accepts four parameters: `v1` and `v2` (integers between 1 and 100), `t` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `d` (an integer between 0 and 10). It calculates the maximum and minimum speeds based on `v1` and `v2`, and then iteratively updates the maximum and minimum speeds over `t-1` iterations. During each iteration, the maximum length covered is updated based on the current maximum speed, and the minimum length covered is updated based on the current minimum speed. After the loop, the function prints the maximum length covered.
