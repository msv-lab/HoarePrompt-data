Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `max_length`: Either 3M or 2M + m
- `max_speed`: Either M or m
- `min_speed`: min(m + d, max_speed)
- `min_length`: original_min_length + m + min(m + d, max_speed)

### Loop Analysis
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop starts from `t-1` and goes down to 1 (not including 0). The loop variable `i` is being decremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the Value of `i` at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - If the loop just completed an iteration, then `i` would have been decremented by 1 from its value in the previous iteration.
   - For example, if `i` was 2 before the current iteration, it would now be 1.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `t-1` down to 1.
   - Therefore, the loop can continue as long as `i` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will be 0 at the start of the next iteration, and the loop will terminate.
   - If `i` was greater than 1, then the loop can continue, and we need to adjust the state accordingly.

Given the loop starts from `t-1` and goes down to 1, let's assume the loop just completed an iteration where `i` was 1. This means the loop can still execute one more time if `i` is 2 at the start of the next iteration.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration
- Since the loop can continue as long as `i` is greater than 0, `i` should be adjusted to 2.
- The other variables (`max_length`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, and `min_length`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting these variables are specified.

### Final State
State: **`max_length` is either 3M or 2M + m; `max_speed` is either M or m; `min_speed` is min(m + d, max_speed); `min_length` is original_min_length + m + min(m + d, max_speed); `i` is 2**
