`min_length` is increased by `min_speed`. The value of `min_speed` is `min(m + d, max_speed)`. The initial value of `min_length` is increased by this expression.

Therefore, the updated value of `min_length` is the original value of `min_length` (which is increased by `m`) plus `min(m + d, max_speed)`.

Since the initial state of `min_length` is increased by `m`, we can express the new value of `min_length` as follows:

- Initial `min_length` = `original_min_length + m`
- New `min_length` = `original_min_length + m + min(m + d, max_speed)`

Given the initial conditions:
- `max_length` is either `3M` or `2M + m`
- `max_speed` is either `M` or `m`
- `min_speed` is `min(m + d, max_speed)`

Output State: **`max_length` is either 3M or 2M + m; `max_speed` is either M or m; `min_speed` is min(m + d, max_speed); `min_length` is original_min_length + m + min(m + d, max_speed)**
