To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the loop variable `i` changes.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`.
   - `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.
   - `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.
   - `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `t - 1` down to `1` (since `range(t - 1, 0, -1)` starts from `t - 1` and goes down to `1`).

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - Let's assume `i` is currently some value `k` where `k` is between `t - 1` and `1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.
   - Since the loop starts from `t - 1` and goes down to `1`, the loop will continue as long as `i > 0`.

5. **Variables Update:**
   - We need to adjust the values of `max_length`, `max_speed`, `min_speed`, and `min_length` based on the current value of `i`.

Given the loop runs in reverse order, let's assume the current value of `i` is `k` (where `k` is the current value of `i`), and the loop will run for `i = k - 1` in the next iteration.

### Adjusted States:

- `max_length`: No direct change here, but it will depend on the new values of `max_speed` and `min_speed` after the loop updates.
- `max_speed`: Updated based on the previous value of `max_speed` and `min_speed`.
- `min_speed`: Updated based on the previous value of `max_speed` and `min_speed`.
- `min_length`: Increased by the previous value of `min_speed`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

- `max_length` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `max_speed` is updated to the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed` from the previous iteration.
- `min_speed` is updated to the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed` from the previous iteration.
- `min_length` is increased by the previous value of `min_speed`.

Since the loop variable `i` decreases by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `k - 1`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

- `max_length` is `max_length + max_speed` (from the previous iteration).
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed` (from the previous iteration).
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed` (from the previous iteration).
- `min_length` is increased by `min_speed` (from the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`max_length` is `max_length + max_speed`, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`, `min_length` is increased by `min_speed`**
