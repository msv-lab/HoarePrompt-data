Output State: **`max_length` is the sum of `min_length` and `t * max_speed`, `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b` decreased by `d * (t - 1)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b` increased by `d * (t - 1)`, `min_length` is the sum of `min_speed` multiplied by `t`, `i` is 0 if the loop does not execute, otherwise `i` is 0.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b`.
   - `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
   - `max_length` is `max_speed * t`.
   - `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t - 1` times, decrementing `i` from `t - 1` to `1`.
   - In each iteration:
     - `max_speed` is updated to be the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.
     - `min_speed` is updated to be the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.
     - `max_length` is incremented by `max_speed`.
     - `min_length` is incremented by `min_speed`.

3. **Final Values After Loop Execution**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be 0 since the loop condition `i > 0` will no longer hold.
   - The final value of `max_length` will be the sum of `min_length` and `t * max_speed` because each increment adds `max_speed` to `max_length`.
   - The final value of `max_speed` will be the maximum of `a` and `b` decreased by `d * (t - 1)`.
   - The final value of `min_speed` will be the minimum of `a` and `b` increased by `d * (t - 1)`.
   - The final value of `min_length` will be the sum of `min_speed` multiplied by `t` because each increment adds `min_speed` to `min_length`.

4. **Case Where the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values remain as they were initialized:
     - `max_length` is `max_speed * t`.
     - `max_speed` is the maximum of `a` and `b`.
     - `min_speed` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
     - `min_length` is `min_speed * t`.
     - `i` is `0`.
