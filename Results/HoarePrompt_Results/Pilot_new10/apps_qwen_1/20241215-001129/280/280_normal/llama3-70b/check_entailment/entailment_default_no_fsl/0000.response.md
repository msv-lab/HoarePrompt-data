Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code calculates the maximum and minimum lengths based on the initial speeds and updates these values iteratively, but it does not correctly handle the constraints of the speed changes between adjacent seconds. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 6
4 2
```
The correct approach would involve ensuring that the speed changes between adjacent seconds do not exceed `d` in absolute value. However, the current implementation simply updates the maximum and minimum speeds without considering the constraint that the difference in speeds between any two adjacent seconds should not exceed `d`. This leads to incorrect results. For instance, the correct sequence of speeds could be `5, 7, 8, 6`, but the code might produce incorrect sequences that violate the speed change constraint.

To fix this, the code should ensure that the speed at each step does not deviate from the previous speed by more than `d`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize the list of speeds
    speeds = [v1]
    for i in range(1, t):
        next_speed = max(v2, min(v1 + d, v2 - d))
        speeds.append(next_speed)
        v1 = next_speed
    
    # Calculate the total length
    total_length = sum(speeds)
    
    print(total_length)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the speed changes between adjacent seconds do not exceed `d` in absolute value, and it calculates the total length correctly.
