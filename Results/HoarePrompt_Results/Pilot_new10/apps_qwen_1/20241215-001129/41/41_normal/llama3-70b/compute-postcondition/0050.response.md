Postcondition: ***`unrated` remains `False`, `j` is `i + 3`, and there exists an index `j > i + 3` such that `ratings_before[i + 3] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i + 3] > ratings_after[j]`. Additionally, if `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, no additional changes occur.***
