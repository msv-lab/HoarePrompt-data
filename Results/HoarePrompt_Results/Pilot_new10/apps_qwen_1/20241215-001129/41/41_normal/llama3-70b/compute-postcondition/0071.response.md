The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution simply ends here without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n`, and we break out of the nearest enclosing loop (if any).**
