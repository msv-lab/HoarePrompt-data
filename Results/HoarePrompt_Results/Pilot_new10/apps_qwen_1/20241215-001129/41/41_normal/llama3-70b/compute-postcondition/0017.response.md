The code sets `unrated` to `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers; `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers; `rated` is False; `unrated` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 1000; `ratings_before` is a list of `n` integers; `ratings_after` is a list of `n` integers; `rated` is False; `unrated` is True.**
