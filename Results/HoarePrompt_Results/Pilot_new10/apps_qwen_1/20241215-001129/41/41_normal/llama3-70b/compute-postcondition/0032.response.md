Postcondition: ***`ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of integers, `i` is the same as the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 3`. If `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `False`. There is no additional change in the value of `unrated` if the condition is not met.***
