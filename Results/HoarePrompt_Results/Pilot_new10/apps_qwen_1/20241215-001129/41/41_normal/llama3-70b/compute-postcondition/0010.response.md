The code appends the value of `b` to the list `ratings_after`. Initially, `ratings_after` is a list containing one element `[b]`. After appending `b`, the list `ratings_after` will contain two elements, both being `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 999; `ratings_before` is `[a, a]`; `ratings_after` is `[b, b]`**
