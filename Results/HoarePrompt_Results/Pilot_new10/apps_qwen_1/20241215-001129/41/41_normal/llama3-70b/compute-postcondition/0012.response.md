The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 0 and 998, and `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists with each element being `a` and `b` respectively, these lists remain unchanged. However, `a` and `b` are now assigned the values of the integers input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 0 and 998; `ratings_before` is `[input_value_of_a, input_value_of_a]`; `ratings_after` is `[input_value_of_b, input_value_of_b]; a` is the first integer input by the user; `b` is the second integer input by the user.**
