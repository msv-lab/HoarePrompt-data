The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the definition `def func():`. The problem description provides constraints and relationships for the input parameters but does not specify where these parameters are passed to the function. Based on the given information, the function itself does not have any parameters.

Since the function does not accept any parameters, we cannot determine its return value without additional context regarding what the function should do with the provided constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and therefore does not return anything based on the provided constraints and relationships.**
