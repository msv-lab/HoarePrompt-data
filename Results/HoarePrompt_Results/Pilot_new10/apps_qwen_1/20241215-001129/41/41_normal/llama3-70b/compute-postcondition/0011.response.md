According to the code, the loop runs `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 999.
- `ratings_before` is `[a, a]`.
- `ratings_after` is `[b, b]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. The value of `n` decreases by 1 after each iteration because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
2. Since `n` is initially a positive integer between 1 and 999, after one iteration, `n` will be a positive integer between 0 and 998.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 999. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` will be reduced by 1, making it a positive integer between 0 and 998.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must now be a positive integer between 0 and 998.
- `ratings_before` remains `[a, a]`.
- `ratings_after` remains `[b, b]`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 0 and 998; `ratings_before` is `[a, a]`; `ratings_after` is `[b, b]`**
