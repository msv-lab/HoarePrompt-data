`rated` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `unrated` is `False`, `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, and the current value of `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`; `rated` is `True`.

Output State: **`unrated` is `False`, `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, and the current value of `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`; `rated` is `True`**
