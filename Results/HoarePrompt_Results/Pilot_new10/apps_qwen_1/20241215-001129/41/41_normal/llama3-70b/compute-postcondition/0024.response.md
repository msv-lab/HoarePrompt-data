Postcondition: **`ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of integers, for indices `i` and `j`, if `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then the condition `unrated` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition is not met, the `unrated` status remains unchanged.**
