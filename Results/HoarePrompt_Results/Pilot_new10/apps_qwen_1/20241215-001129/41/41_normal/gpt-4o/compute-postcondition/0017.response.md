`ratings` is appended with the tuple `(a, b)`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the state of `is_unrated` and `is_rated` is also not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `ratings` contains the initial tuples \((a, b)\) plus the new tuple \((a, b)\), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True` if \(a \neq b\), otherwise `True`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `ratings` contains the initial tuples \((a, b)\) plus the new tuple \((a, b)\), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True` if \(a \neq b\), otherwise `True`.**
