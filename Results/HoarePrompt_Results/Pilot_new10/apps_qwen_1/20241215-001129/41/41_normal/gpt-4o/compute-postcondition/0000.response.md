The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This input is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000. After this line of code executes, the variable `n` will hold the value of the input integer, and the other variables (`a_i` and `b_i`) are not yet defined.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined**
