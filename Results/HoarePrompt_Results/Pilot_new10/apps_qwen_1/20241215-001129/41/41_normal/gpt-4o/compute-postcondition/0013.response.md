The code sets `is_rated` to `True`. Since `is_rated` was already `True` if `a` was not equal to `b`, and it remains `True` even if `a` equals `b`, the value of `is_rated` does not change. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n - 1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is a list containing two tuples (`a`, `b`), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True`**
