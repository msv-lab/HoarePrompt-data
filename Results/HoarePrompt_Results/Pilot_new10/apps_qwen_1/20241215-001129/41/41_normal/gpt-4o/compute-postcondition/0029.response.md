The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `ratings`, `is_unrated`, and `is_rated`. It simply breaks out of the current loop or conditional block, but does not change the values of the variables.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples, `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`**
