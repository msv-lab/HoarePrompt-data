The code prints 'unrated', which does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `ratings`, `is_unrated`, or `is_rated`. The precondition that `is_unrated` is `True` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`, and the program prints 'unrated'**
