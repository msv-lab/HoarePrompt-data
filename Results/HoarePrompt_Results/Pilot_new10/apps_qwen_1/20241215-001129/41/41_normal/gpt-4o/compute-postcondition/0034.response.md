Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples, `is_unrated` remains `True`, `is_rated` remains `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]` is true. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
