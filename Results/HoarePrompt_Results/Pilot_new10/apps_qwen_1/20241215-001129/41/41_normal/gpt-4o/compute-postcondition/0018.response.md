The variable `is_rated` is set to `True`. The initial state of `is_rated` being `True` if \(a \neq b\) and `False` otherwise does not change because the assignment directly sets `is_rated` to `True`. The values of `a`, `b`, `ratings`, and `is_unrated` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `ratings` contains the initial tuples \((a, b)\) plus the new tuple \((a, b)\), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True`.**
