The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The previous values of `a` and `b` are replaced by these new inputs. The other variables remain unchanged.

Here's the updated state:
- `n` is within the range 2 ≤ n - 1 ≤ 1000
- `a` is an input integer (updated to the value of the first input)
- `b` is an input integer (updated to the value of the second input)
- `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined
- `ratings` is a list containing one tuple `(a, b)`
- `is_unrated` is `False`
- `is_rated` is `True` if `a` is not equal to `b`, otherwise it remains `True` (since the condition for `is_rated` is based on the original values of `a` and `b` before the input)

Output State: **`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n - 1 ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_i` and `b_i` are not yet defined, `ratings` is a list containing one tuple (`a`, `b`), `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True` if `a` is not equal to `b`, otherwise `True`**
