Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\)
   - `is_unrated` is `True`
   - `is_rated` is `False`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (since the range is `range(1, n)`).

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but it contains a condition: `if ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` followed by a `break`.

4. **Postconditions**:
   - If the condition `ratings[i-1][0] < ratings[i][0]` is met, the loop breaks, and the states do not change further in the loop body.
   - If the condition is not met, the states remain unchanged as well.

5. **Current State Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, meaning the first element of `ratings` has been compared with the second element.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

Given this analysis, we can adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `ratings` remains a list containing exactly `n` tuples.
- `is_unrated` and `is_rated` states depend on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, these states remain the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body, which they aren't here.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples, `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`**
