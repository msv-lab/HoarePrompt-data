You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".

2246 2246
1699 1699

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings.append((a, b))
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
    if not is_rated:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
    if is_rated:
        print('rated')
    elif is_unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines whether the round is unrated. Specifically, the program checks if the round is rated by looking for any change in ratings, but it incorrectly determines the round as unrated if it finds any pair of consecutive participants where the previous participant has a lower rating than the next participant. This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility that the round could be rated but no participant's rating would have changed due to the specific ranking order of the participants.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
5
3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699
```
In this case, no one's rating has changed, and the participants are ranked in a non-increasing order of their ratings. However, the program will incorrectly mark this as "unrated" because it finds a pair where the previous participant (1699) has a lower rating than the next participant (2246).

A correct approach would be to check both conditions: whether any ratings have changed and whether the participants are ranked in non-increasing order of their ratings. Only if both conditions fail should the program output "maybe".

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings = []
    is_rated = False
    is_unrated = False
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        ratings.append((a, b))
        
        if a != b:
            is_rated = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `False`, and `is_rated` is `True` if at least one of the tuples \((a_i, b_i)\) satisfies \(a_i \neq b_i\), otherwise `is_rated` is `False`.
    if (not is_rated) :
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i - 1][0] < ratings[i][0]:
                is_unrated = True
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` is `False`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), `is_unrated` is `True`, and `is_rated` remains unchanged. If the condition inside the if statement is true, `i` is set to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\). If the condition inside the if statement is false, `i` is set to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\).
    if is_rated :
        print('rated')
    else :
        if is_unrated :
            print('unrated')
        else :
            print('maybe')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), and either 'unrated' or 'maybe' is printed to the console. `is_unrated` is `False` and `is_rated` is `False`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `ratings` is a list containing exactly `n` tuples \((a_i, b_i)\), and either 'rated', 'unrated', or 'maybe' is printed to the console. `is_unrated` and `is_rated` are both set to `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of \(n\) tuples \((a_i, b_i)\) where \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 4126\). It checks if any \(a_i \neq b_i\) to determine if the ratings are rated. If not, it checks if the first elements of consecutive tuples are strictly increasing to determine if the ratings are unrated. If neither condition is met, it prints 'maybe'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
