The code reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) from input using `input().split()` and then converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that \(a\) and \(b\) will take on the values of these two integers. The values of other variables such as `ratings`, `is_unrated`, and `is_rated` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `ratings` contains the initial tuples \((a, b)\) from the previous iterations, `is_unrated` is `False`, `is_rated` is `True` if \(a \neq b\), otherwise `True`.**
