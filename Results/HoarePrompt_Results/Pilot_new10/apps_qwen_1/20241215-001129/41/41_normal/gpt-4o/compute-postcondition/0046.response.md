The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates on inputs that are part of its execution context, specifically, it takes a single integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\)) followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers \(a_{i}\) and \(b_{i}\) (where \(1 \leq a_{i}, b_{i} \leq 4126\)). Based on these inputs, the function does not return a specific value but processes the data according to the given constraints.

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined in the problem statement, we can infer that the function might perform some kind of processing or computation on the provided inputs. However, since no specific output cases are mentioned, we focus on the input parameters and their constraints.
