`curr_start` and `curr_end` are assigned the values from `segments[i]`. Since `i` is 3, it refers to the fourth segment, so `curr_start` becomes `segments[3][0]` and `curr_end` becomes `segments[3][1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `prev_start` is the start value of the third segment, `prev_end` is the end value of the third segment, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`**
