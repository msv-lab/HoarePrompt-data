Output State: **`segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, starting from the first 'G' found and ending just before the next 'S' or the end of the string, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.**

Explanation:
1. The loop starts with `i` set to 0.
2. It searches for the first 'G' in `trophies` starting from index 2 (or 3 if the first two characters are 'G').
3. For each segment of consecutive 'G's, it records the start and end indices in the `segments` list.
4. When a 'S' is encountered, the loop stops and increments `i` to the index of the 'S'.
5. After all possible segments of 'G's have been identified, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop exits when `i` reaches the end of the string.
6. The `segments` list will contain all segments of consecutive 'G's found in `trophies`.

Since the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, and it only increments `i` when it encounters a 'S', `i` will eventually be equal to `n` after processing all elements in `trophies`.
