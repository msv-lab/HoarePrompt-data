`max_length` is assigned the value of the maximum between `max_length` and the expression `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. Given the initial states, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`, `prev_start` is the start value of the third segment, and `prev_end` is the end value of the third segment. Since no specific values for `curr_start`, `curr_end`, `prev_start`, and `prev_end` are given, we cannot simplify the expression further without those values. However, we know the structure of the expression.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `prev_start` is the start value of the third segment, `prev_end` is the end value of the third segment, `curr_start` is `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is `segments[3][1]`, `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`.**
