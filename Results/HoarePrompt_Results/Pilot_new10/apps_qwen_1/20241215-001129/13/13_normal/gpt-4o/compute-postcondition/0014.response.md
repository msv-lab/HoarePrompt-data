The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial value of `i` is 2. After executing the code, `i` will be 3. The states of the other variables (`segments`, `n`, `trophies`) are not affected.

Output State: **`segments` is an empty list `[]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is 3, and `trophies[i]` is not 'G'**
