Output State: **`segments` is either `[('2', 'i - 1')]` or `[]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed and must satisfy `i < n`, and `i` is the smallest index starting from 2 where `trophies[i]` is not 'G'.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`.
- After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be the smallest index starting from 2 where `trophies[i]` is not 'G', or `i` will be `n` if no such index exists.
- The `segments` list remains unchanged unless it was initialized with `[('2', 'i - 1')]` when `i` was set to 2 initially.
- The value of `start` is always one less than the final value of `i` because `start` is initialized to `i` at the start of the loop and remains unchanged.
- The conditions `n` and `trophies` do not change within the loop and remain as they were in the initial state.
