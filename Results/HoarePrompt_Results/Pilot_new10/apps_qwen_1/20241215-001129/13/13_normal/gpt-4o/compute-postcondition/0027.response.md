`i` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `segments` and `trophies` remains unchanged since the code does not affect these variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `segments` is either `[('2', 'i - 1')]` where `i` is the smallest index starting from 2 where `trophies[i]` is not 'G', or an empty list `[]`; `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', and `trophies[i]` is not 'G'; variable `i` is increased by 1.
