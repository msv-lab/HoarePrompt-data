`prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the values of `segments[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `segments[i - 1]` refers to `segments[0]`. Therefore, `prev_start` is assigned the start value of the first segment, and `prev_end` is assigned the end value of the first segment. The length of `segments` is still greater than 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `prev_start` is the start value of the first segment in `segments`, `prev_end` is the end value of the first segment in `segments`, `len(segments)` is greater than 1**
