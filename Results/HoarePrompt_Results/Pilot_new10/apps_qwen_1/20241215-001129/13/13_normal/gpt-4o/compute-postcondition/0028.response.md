Postcondition: ***`segments` is either `[('2', 'i - 1'), ('2', 'i - 1')]` or `[('None', 'i - 1')]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `i` is the smallest index starting from 2 where `trophies[i]` is not 'G', and `i` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed. If `trophies[i]` is not 'G', `segments` remains as `[('2', 'i - 1')]` or becomes an empty list `[]`, and `i` is increased by 1.***
