`i` is incremented by 1. Given the precondition, `i` must satisfy `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`. The values of `segments`, `n`, and `trophies` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `segments` is either `[('2', 'i - 1')]` or `[]`; `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `i` is incremented by 1 and must satisfy `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`.

Output State: **`segments` is either `[('2', 'i - 1')]` or `[]`; `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `i` is incremented by 1 and must satisfy `i < n and trophies[i] == 'G'`.**
