You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, starting from the first 'G' found and ending just before the next 'S' or the end of the string, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, starting from the first 'G' found and ending just before the next 'S' or the end of the string, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. The list `segments` is not empty
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns the maximum length of the segment containing consecutive 'G's in the list 'segments', which is the length of the single segment present
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `segments` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive 'G's in `trophies`, starting from the first 'G' found and ending just before the next 'S' or the end of the string, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `max_length` is the maximum length of the segments in `segments`; `len(segments)` is greater than 1
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `len(segments)`, `prev_start` is the start value of the last segment in `segments`, `prev_end` is the end value of the last segment in `segments`, `curr_start` is undefined, `curr_end` is undefined, and `max_length` is the maximum value of `max_length` updated during the loop iterations based on the condition `curr_start - prev_end == 2`.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #`The program returns the minimum value between max_length + 1 and n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' (golden) and 'S' (silver). The function processes the string to find segments of consecutive 'G's and calculates the maximum length of these segments. If no segments are found, it returns 0. If there is only one segment, it returns its length. If there are multiple segments, it checks for specific conditions where the segments can be combined to form longer segments and updates the maximum length accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum value between the updated maximum length plus one and the length of the string `trophies`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
