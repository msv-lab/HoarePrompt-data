`beauty` is incremented by 1 because the code `beauty += 1` adds 1 to the current value of `beauty`. The value of `j` is `i + 2`, which remains unchanged, and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`. The string `s` is not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[i+2:i+3]` plus 1, `j` is `i + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
