The code updates `max_beauty` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. Since `curr_beauty` is not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `max_beauty` is updated to be at least as large as `curr_beauty`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `left`, `right`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is the same as the previous iteration, `right` is `n - 1`**
