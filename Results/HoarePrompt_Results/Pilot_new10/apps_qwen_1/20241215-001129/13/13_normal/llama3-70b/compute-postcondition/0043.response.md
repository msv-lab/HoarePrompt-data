The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Given that `left` was an index where `s[left]` is not 'G', and now it is incremented by 1, the new value of `left` will be one more than its previous value. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1, `left` is `left + 1`, `right` is `n - 2`, and `curr_beauty` is 0.**
