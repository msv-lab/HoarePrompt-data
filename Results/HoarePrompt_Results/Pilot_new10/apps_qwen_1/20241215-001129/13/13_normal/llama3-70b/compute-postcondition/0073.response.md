Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `s` is a string where the current value of `s[n - 1]` is 'G' and the current value of `s[n]` is 'S', and `beauty` is `n` if all characters from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]` are 'G'. Otherwise, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G' characters starting from `s[0]` up to the first 'S'.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates backward from `i - 1` to `-1`.
- For each iteration, if `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[j]` is not 'G', the loop breaks, and `beauty` retains its current value.
- The loop starts from `i - 1` (which is initially 0) and continues until it reaches `-1`.
- If the entire substring from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]` consists only of 'G' characters, `beauty` will be equal to `n` because it will increment by 1 for each character.
- If there is any 'S' before reaching the end of the string, `beauty` will be the count of consecutive 'G' characters starting from the beginning of the string up to the first 'S'.

This output state covers all possible scenarios based on the loop's behavior and the conditions specified in the problem.
