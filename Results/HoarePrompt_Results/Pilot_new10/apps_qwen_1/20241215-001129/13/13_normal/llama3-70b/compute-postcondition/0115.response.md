`beauty` is incremented by 1. Initially, `beauty` is at most 3. After adding 1, the new value of `beauty` is at most 4 (since it cannot exceed 3). The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `max_beauty_one_swap`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `j` is 5, `beauty` is at most 4, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration.**
