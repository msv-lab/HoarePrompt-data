`left` is incremented by 1. Since `left` was the same as the previous iteration, its new value is the previous value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is the previous value of `left` + 1, `right` is `n - 1`, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
