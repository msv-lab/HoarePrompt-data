Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `j` is determined based on the condition `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`
   - `beauty` is either 2 or 1
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to 'G', the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = i-1` to `j = -1` (inclusive), with a step of `-1`.

3. **Iteration Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been decremented from its initial value.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be within the range defined by the loop condition.

Given that the loop starts at `i-1` and decrements `j` until it reaches `-1`, let's consider the possible values for `j` at the start of the next iteration:

- Initially, `j` is set based on the condition `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`.
- If `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`, then `j` would be 1 initially.
- The loop runs as follows:
  - First iteration: `j = 1`
  - Second iteration: `j = 0`
  - Third iteration: `j = -1`

Since the loop stops when `j` reaches `-1`, the loop will only run for a maximum of 3 iterations (from `j = 1` to `j = -1`).

At the end of the previous iteration (the second iteration), `j` would be 0.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `-1`.
   - Therefore, we need to set `j` to `-1` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 2.
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` are updated but their values are not specified to change in the next iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is -1, `beauty` is either 2 or 1, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary.**
