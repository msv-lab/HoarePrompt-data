To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states step by step.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over indices starting from `i + 2` (which is `n - 1 + 2 = n + 1`) to `n`. This means the loop will only execute if there are elements in `s` beyond index `n - 1` and `n`.

The loop checks each element in this range:
- If `s[j] == 'G'`, it increments `beauty` by 1.
- If `s[j] != 'G'`, it breaks out of the loop.

### Understanding the Loop Execution
Given the output states for a few iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `j` is `n`.
- After 2 iterations, `j` is `n + 1`.
- After 3 iterations, `j` is `n + 2`.

From these, we can infer that the loop will continue until it finds an element that is not 'G' or reaches the end of the string `s`.

### Determining the Final State
- **If the loop executes and `s[j]` is never 'S':**
  - `j` will eventually reach `n` (since the loop stops when `j` is `n` and `s[j]` is not 'G').
  - `beauty` will be the count of consecutive 'G's from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]`.

- **If the loop executes and `s[j]` is 'S':**
  - The loop will break out of the loop as soon as it encounters an 'S'.
  - `beauty` will be the count of consecutive 'G's from `s[0]` to the last 'G' before `s[j]`.

- **If the loop does not execute:**
  - This would mean that `s[n+1]` (which is out of bounds) would need to be checked, indicating an empty string or an invalid state.
  - However, since `j` starts from `n + 1`, the loop will not execute at all if `s` is too short or invalid.

### Final Output State
Considering all possible scenarios, the final output state after the loop has finished executing (or not executing) is:

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n` if the loop does not execute, otherwise `j` is the first index `k` such that `s[k] != 'G'` or `n` if no such index exists, `beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's from `s[0]` to `s[n-1]` if the loop does not break early, otherwise the count of 'G's from `s[0]` to the last 'G' before `s[j]`.**
