The code snippet sets `curr_beauty` to 0. This means that `curr_beauty` is no longer equal to its previous value (which was not specified but could have been something other than 0), and is now explicitly set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is unchanged, `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G', `right` has incremented by 1 on each iteration since the start of the loop**
