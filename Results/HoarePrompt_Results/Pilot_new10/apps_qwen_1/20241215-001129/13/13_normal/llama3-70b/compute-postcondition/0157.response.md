The code snippet updates `max_beauty_one_swap` with the maximum value between its current value and `beauty`. The value of `beauty` is determined by finding the largest index `j` such that `s[j] == 'G'` and `j >= i + 2`, or it is 0 if no such `j` exists. Since the code only updates `max_beauty_one_swap` without changing the values of `s` or `beauty`, and does not provide new information about `i` or `n`, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the values of these variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `beauty` is the number of 'G' characters in the substring `s[j:j+1]` where `j` is the largest index such that `s[j] == 'G'` and `j >= i + 2`, or `beauty` is 0 if no such `j` exists; `j` is the index where the loop last checked, which is `n - 1` if the loop did not break early, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`.**
