The code `beauty += 1` increments the value of `beauty` by 1. Given the initial state, `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string `s` that is one less than its previous value, and `beauty` is increased by 1 if `s[j]` is 'G'. Otherwise, `beauty` remains unchanged. Since the code only affects `beauty`, it increases by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string `s` that is one less than its previous value, and `beauty` is increased by 1**
