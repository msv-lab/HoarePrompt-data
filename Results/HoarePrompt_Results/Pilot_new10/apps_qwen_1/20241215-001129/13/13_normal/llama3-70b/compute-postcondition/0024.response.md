The code `curr_beauty += 1` increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. Since `curr_beauty` was not initialized in the given initial state, we assume it was initialized to 0 before this line of code was executed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the same as the previous iteration, `left` is the same as the previous iteration, `right` is `n - 1`, `curr_beauty` is 1**
