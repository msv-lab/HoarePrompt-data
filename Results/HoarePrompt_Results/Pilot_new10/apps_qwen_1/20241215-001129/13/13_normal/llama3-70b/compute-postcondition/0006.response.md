According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `right`, which ranges from 0 to \(n-1\). For the loop to execute, `right` must take values from 0 to \(n-1\).

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Initial Value of `right`:** The initial value of `right` should be 0 because the loop starts with the first iteration where `right` is 0.
2. **Final Value of `right`:** After the loop completes, `right` should be \(n-1\) because the loop iterates until `right` reaches \(n-1\).
3. **Range of `right`:** Since the loop iterates through all possible values from 0 to \(n-1\), we need to ensure that `right` takes on each value in this range.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `right` should start at 0.
- `right` should increment by 1 on each iteration.
- The loop should continue as long as `right < n`.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0 initially and must increment by 1 on each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `right < n`**.
