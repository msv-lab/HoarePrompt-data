The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Given the conditions and states described:

1. `left` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration.
2. `right` was also incremented by 1 in the previous iteration.
3. The condition `s[left] != 'G'` must be satisfied for the loop to continue.

Since `left` and `right` were both incremented by 1, and `right` was not 'G', `s[left]` (which is now `s[right-1]`) must be 'S' for the loop to continue. Therefore, `left` is incremented by 1 again, and the new value of `left` is `left + 1`.

The output state after this code execution is:
- `left` is incremented by 1, so it is now `left + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged: `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is `left + 1`, `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G'**
