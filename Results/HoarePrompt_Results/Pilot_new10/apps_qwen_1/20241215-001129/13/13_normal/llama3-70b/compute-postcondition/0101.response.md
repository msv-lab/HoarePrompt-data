The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code, the only effect is that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block it is inside. However, since the initial state does not specify which loop or conditional block this is inside, we assume it is exiting the most internal loop or conditional block.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 2
- `j` is -1
- `beauty` is either 2 or 1
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary

The `break` statement does not change these values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is -1, `beauty` is either 2 or 1, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary.**
