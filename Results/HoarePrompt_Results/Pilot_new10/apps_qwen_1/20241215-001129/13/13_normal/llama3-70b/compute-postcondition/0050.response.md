`curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of `left`, `right`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and the condition `left < right` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the index where `s[left] == 'G'` (or `left == right` if no more 'G' is found), `right` is `n - 2`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` retain their original values, and the condition `left < right` remains true.
