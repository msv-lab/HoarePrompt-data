The code `break` does not affect any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a string where the current value of `s[0]` is 'G' and the current value of `s[1]` is 'S', `beauty` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
