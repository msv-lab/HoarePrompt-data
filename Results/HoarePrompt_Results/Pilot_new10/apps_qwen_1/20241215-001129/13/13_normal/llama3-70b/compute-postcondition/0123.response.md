The code snippet `max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)` updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`. Since no new information about `beauty` is given in the snippet, `beauty` remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is at most 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration, which now includes the current value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `beauty` is at most 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty`**.
