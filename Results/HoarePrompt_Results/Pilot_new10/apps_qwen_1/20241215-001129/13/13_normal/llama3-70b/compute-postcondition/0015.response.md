`left` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `left` was less than `right`, and since `right` is such that `s[right]` is not 'G' and `right` has incremented by 1, the condition `left < right` still holds. The value of `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, as the only affected variable is `left`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `right`, `right` is a value such that `right < n` and `s[right]` is not 'G', `right` has incremented by 1.
