You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where there are isolated golden trophies (not part of a contiguous segment of golden trophies) that could potentially be swapped to increase the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGS
Output
Expected: 8
Actual: 7
```

In this case, the program only considers swapping the first 'S' with a 'G' to its left, resulting in "GGGGGGGSGS" with a maximum subsegment length of 7. However, a better approach would be to swap the last 'S' with the 'G' immediately before it, resulting in "GGGGGGGGSG" with a maximum subsegment length of 8.

To fix this, the program needs to check both ends of the sequence for isolated golden trophies and calculate the potential increase in the length of the longest subsegment by making these swaps.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and the second line of input is a string consisting of n characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for i, x in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum beauty found during the traversal of `s`, `curr_beauty` is the beauty at the last position `right` where `s[right]` is 'G' or 0, `left` is the index of the last 'G' character in `s` or `n` if no 'G' characters are present.
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is the largest index such that `s[j] == 'G'` and `j >= i + 2`, or `n` if no such index exists, `beauty` is the maximum value of `beauty` calculated for all valid pairs, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value of `beauty` across all iterations.
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and a string `s` consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', representing golden and silver trophies respectively. It calculates the maximum beauty of the trophies by either keeping them as they are or by swapping one silver trophy for a golden one. The maximum beauty is defined as the maximum number of consecutive golden trophies. The function returns the higher of the original maximum beauty and the maximum beauty after one possible swap.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
