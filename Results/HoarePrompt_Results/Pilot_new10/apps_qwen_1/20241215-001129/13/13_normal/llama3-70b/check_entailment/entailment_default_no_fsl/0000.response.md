Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum beauty after one possible swap is flawed. Hereâ€™s an example where the code fails:

Consider the input:
```
6
GSGGGS
```

The expected output should be 4 because we can swap the first 'S' with the last 'G' to get "GGGGGS", which has a maximum beauty of 4.

However, the current implementation does not consider this scenario correctly. It only checks for a single 'S' followed by a 'G' and does not account for other possible swaps that could increase the beauty. For instance, it does not check for the possibility of swapping the 'S' with a 'G' that is further away from the initial position of the 'S'.

To fix this, a more comprehensive approach is needed to consider all possible swaps and their effects on the maximum beauty. This would involve iterating through all possible pairs of positions for the swap and checking the resulting beauty.
