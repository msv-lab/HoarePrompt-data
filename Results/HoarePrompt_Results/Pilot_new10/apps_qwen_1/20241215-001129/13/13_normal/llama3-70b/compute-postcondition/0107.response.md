Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is -1, `beauty` is at most 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The initial state sets `i` to 1, `n` to be at least 2, and `j` is determined based on the condition `s[1] == 'G' and s[2] == 'S'`. `beauty` is initialized to 1, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated if necessary.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs in reverse from `i-1` down to 0 (since `i` is set to 2 in the initial state, the loop will run from 1 to 0).
   - For each iteration, if `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` increments by 1. If `s[j]` is not 'G', the loop breaks.
3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` remains 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `j` will be -1 because the loop stops when it encounters a character other than 'G' (or reaches the end of the string if all characters are 'G').
   - `beauty` will be the maximum possible value it reached during the loop, which is at most 3 (since the initial `beauty` is 1 and it can increment by 1 for each 'G' found, but the loop stops at the first non-'G' character, so the maximum is 3 if the first two characters are 'G' and the third one is anything other than 'G').
   - `max_beauty_one_swap` will hold the maximum value between its current value and the final value of `beauty`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all iterations is as described above.
