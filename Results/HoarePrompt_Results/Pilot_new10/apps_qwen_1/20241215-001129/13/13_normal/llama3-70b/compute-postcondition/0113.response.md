Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `beauty` is at most 3, and `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum value between its current value and `beauty` after the last iteration. If the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is updated to 4. Otherwise, the character at index `j` of `s` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
