To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following aspects:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `right` from 0 to `n-1`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S'.
   - `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
   - `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
   - `left` is the index where `s[left] == 'G'` (or `left == right` if no more 'G' is found).
   - `right` is `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s[right] == 'G'` (or `s[right] == 'S'` if no 'G' is found).
- `curr_beauty` is 1 if `s[right] == 'G'`.
- `max_beauty` is updated accordingly.
- `left` is adjusted to point to the next 'G' in `s`.
- `curr_beauty` remains 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `right` must be decreased by 1 to continue iterating through the string `s` from the end towards the beginning.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `right` decreases by 1, so the new value of `right` is `n - 2`.
- `left` remains as the index of the next 'G' in `s` found during the previous iteration.
- `curr_beauty` remains 1 since it was reset in the previous iteration when `s[right]` was checked.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters, each being either 'G' or 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `max_beauty` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`, `left` is the index where `s[left] == 'G'` (or `left == right` if no more 'G' is found), `right` is `n - 2`, and `curr_beauty` remains 1.**
