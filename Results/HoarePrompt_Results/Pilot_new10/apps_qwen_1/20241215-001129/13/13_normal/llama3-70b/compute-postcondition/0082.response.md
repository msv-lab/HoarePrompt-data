The code `break` does not affect the values of `i` and `j`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is inside, but since there is no loop or if statement specified in the initial context, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n + 1`**
