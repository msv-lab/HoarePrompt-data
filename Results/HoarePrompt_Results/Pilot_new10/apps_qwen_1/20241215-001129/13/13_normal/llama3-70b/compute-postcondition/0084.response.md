Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `j` is `n + 1`
   - If `s[j] == 'G'`, then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made to `beauty`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 2` to `n` (inclusive). This means:
   - The loop starts with `j = i + 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` would be incremented by 1.

3. **Current Value of `j`**: Since `i` is `n - 1`, the starting value of `j` would be `n + 1`. Therefore, `j` must increment from `n + 1` to the next value, which is `n + 2`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range `[i + 2, n]`. Given `i = n - 1`, the condition becomes `[n + 1, n]`. However, since `j` is currently `n + 1`, it needs to be `n + 2` to enter the loop.

5. **Adjusting States**: If `j` is `n + 1`, it needs to be incremented to `n + 2` for the loop to execute. Also, if `s[j] == 'G'`, `beauty` should be increased by 1, but since `j` is just about to be incremented, this check will happen in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `j` becomes `n + 2`.
- `beauty` will either remain the same or increase by 1 depending on the value of `s[n + 2]`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, `beauty` may be increased by 1 if `s[n + 2] == 'G'`**
