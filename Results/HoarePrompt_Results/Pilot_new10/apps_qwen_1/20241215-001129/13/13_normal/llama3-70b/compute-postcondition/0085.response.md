The `beauty` variable is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `beauty` may be increased by 1 if `s[n + 2] == 'G'`. However, since the code simply increments `beauty` without checking the condition, `beauty` is increased by 1 regardless of the value of `s[n + 2]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, `beauty` is `beauty + 1`**
