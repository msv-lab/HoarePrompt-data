Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
8
GGSGGGGS
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Program Output:**
```
5
```

The program fails to account for the optimal swap between the second and eighth trophies, which would result in the sequence "GGGGGGGGS" and a maximum subsegment length of 6. The current implementation only checks for adjacent swaps, but does not consider non-adjacent swaps like this one. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this and potentially other inputs where a non-adjacent swap could provide a better solution.
