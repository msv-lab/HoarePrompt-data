Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly decode the genome under the given constraints. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization and Counting**: The program initializes a dictionary `count` to keep track of the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides, excluding the '?' characters.
2. **Average Calculation**: It calculates the average number of each type of nucleotide needed (`avg = n // 4`).
3. **Decoding Loop**: For each '?' character in the string, it replaces it with the first available nucleotide from 'ACGT' that has a positive count in the `count` dictionary.
4. **Validation**: After the loop, it checks if any nucleotide count is still above zero. If so, it prints "===" indicating it's impossible to decode; otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

Given the examples provided and the general logic of the program, it handles all valid cases correctly. The program ensures that each nucleotide type ends up with an equal count, and it handles the scenario where decoding is impossible by checking the final counts. Since no counterexample was found, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
