The code `counts[char] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `char` in the dictionary `counts` by 1. The value of `char` remains the same, and the sum of all values in `counts` will now be `target_count + 1` because we added 1 to one of the existing values. The states of the other variables (`result[i]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`counts` is a dictionary with the value of `counts[char]` increased by 1, the sum of all values in `counts` is `target_count + 1`, `result[i]` is equal to `char`.**
