Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary with at least one element, and there is at least one key `char` in `counts` where `counts[char] < target_count`. If `counts[char] + 1 < target_count`, then `result[i]` is set to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `counts` or `result`.***
