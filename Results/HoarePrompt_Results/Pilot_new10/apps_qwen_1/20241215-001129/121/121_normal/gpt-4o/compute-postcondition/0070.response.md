`counts[char]` is incremented by 1, which means the count for the character `char` in the dictionary `counts` is increased by 1. However, the provided code snippet does not specify the exact character `char`. Since an `IndexError` is raised, it implies that `char` is not a valid key in the `counts` dictionary at the time of the increment operation.

Given the initial state:
- `counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all values is exactly `target_count - 1`.
- `result` is a list containing each character of `s` where the corresponding `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`.
- `i` is 2.

Since an `IndexError` is raised, `char` is not a valid key in `counts`. This means the output state remains the same as the initial state because no valid key was found to increment, and no new keys were added.

Output State: **`counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all values is exactly `target_count - 1`, `result` is a list containing each character of `s` where the corresponding `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, and `i` is 2. An IndexError is raised.**
