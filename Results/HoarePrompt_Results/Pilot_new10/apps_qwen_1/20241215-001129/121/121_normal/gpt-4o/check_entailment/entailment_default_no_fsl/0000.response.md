Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description for every potential case:

1. **Handling of '?' Characters**: The code attempts to replace '?' characters with the appropriate nucleotide to balance the counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. However, it does not ensure that after replacing the '?' characters, the final counts of each nucleotide are exactly `n // 4`. Instead, it only checks if the initial counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are less than or equal to `n // 4` before making replacements. This means it may not always achieve the required balance after replacements.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle cases where the genome cannot be balanced after replacing '?' characters. For example, consider the input "????G?". According to the problem description, this should result in "===" because it is impossible to balance the counts of nucleotides. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify such cases.

3. **Multiple Solutions**: The code does not ensure that the solution is unique. It simply replaces '?' characters one by one without checking if other combinations could also satisfy the conditions. This might lead to incorrect outputs for some cases.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case "????G?":
- The initial counts of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' are 0, 0, 1, and 0 respectively.
- The target count for each nucleotide is 2 (since \(8 // 4 = 2\)).
- The code will attempt to replace the '?' characters, but since the count of 'G' is already 1, it might incorrectly produce a valid output like "ACGGTTAT" instead of printing "===".

Therefore, the code does not meet the problem description for every potential case, leading to **False**.
