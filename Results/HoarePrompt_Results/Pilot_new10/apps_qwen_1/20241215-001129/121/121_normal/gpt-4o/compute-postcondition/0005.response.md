The code `print('===')` prints the string '===' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `s`, `data`, or `input`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `s` is the second element of the `data` list, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `input` is the concatenated string of the input values, and the current value of `n` is not divisible by 4**
