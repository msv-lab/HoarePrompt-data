Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary where the value of `counts[char]` is increased by 1, the sum of all values in `counts` is `target_count + 1`, and `result[i]` is equal to `char`. The operation is performed and the loop or statement is broken out of if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `counts` or `result`.***
