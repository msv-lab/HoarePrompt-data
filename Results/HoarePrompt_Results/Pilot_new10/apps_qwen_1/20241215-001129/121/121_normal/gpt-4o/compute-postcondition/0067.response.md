Postcondition: ***`counts` is a dictionary where the sum of all values is exactly `target_count - 1`, `result` is a list containing each character of `s` where the corresponding `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, and `i` is 1. This holds whether `counts[char] < target_count` is true or false.***
