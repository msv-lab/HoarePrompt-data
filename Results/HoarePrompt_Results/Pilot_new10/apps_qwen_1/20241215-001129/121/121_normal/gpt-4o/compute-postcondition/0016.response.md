Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 255\) and `n` is still divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string starting with the second character of the original `s`, `data` is the same list, `input` is the same concatenated string, `target_count` is \(n // 4\). If the first character of `s` (`char_1`) is found in `counts`, then `counts[char_1]` is incremented by 1. No other changes occur in the program state if the condition is not met.***
