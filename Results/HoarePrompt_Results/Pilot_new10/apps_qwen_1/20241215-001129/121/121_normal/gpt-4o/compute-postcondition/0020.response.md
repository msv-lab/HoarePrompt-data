Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 255\) and `n` is still divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string that is completely exhausted (i.e., `s` becomes an empty string), `data` is the same list, `input` is the same concatenated string, `target_count` is \(n // 4\), and `counts` is a dictionary with the count of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') found in the string `s`.**
