Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 255\) and `n` is divisible by 4, `s` is a non-empty string that is completely exhausted, `data` is the same list, `input` is the same concatenated string, `target_count` is \(n // 4\), `result` is a list containing each character of `s`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `result[i]` is `'?'`.**
