The given code reads input from standard input and assigns it to a variable named `input`. However, since no specific operations are performed on the input, the values of the genome length `n` and the genome string `s` remain unchanged. The `input` variable will contain the concatenated string of the input values.

Given the initial state:
- The genome length `n` is an integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 255).
- The genome string `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

After executing the code:
- The input is read into the `input` variable as a single concatenated string.

Output State: **The genome length `n` is an integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 255); the genome string `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `input` is the concatenated string of the input values.**
