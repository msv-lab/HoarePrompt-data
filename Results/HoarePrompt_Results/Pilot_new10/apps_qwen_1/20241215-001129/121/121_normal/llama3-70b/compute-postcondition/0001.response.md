`s` is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255. The code `s = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The previous value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the input string from the user, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255**
