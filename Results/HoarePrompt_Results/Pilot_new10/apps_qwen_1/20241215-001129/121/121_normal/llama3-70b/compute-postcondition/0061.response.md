Postcondition: ***`ACGT` must not be empty, `c` is no longer modified, `res` is either `(count['A'] + 'C') + (nc - 1)` if `count[nc] > 0`, or remains as `(count['A'] + 'C')` if `count[nc] <= 0`, `count['A']` remains unchanged, `count['C']` is further decremented, and `count['G']` and `count['T']` remain unchanged.***
