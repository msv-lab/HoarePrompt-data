Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly decodes the genome by replacing '?' characters with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each nucleotide appears exactly `n // 4` times. The output hints are consistent with the program's functionality, indicating that the program handles both valid and invalid cases appropriately. The program checks if it's possible to decode the genome by ensuring all nucleotide counts are equal and prints '===' if not. Otherwise, it prints the modified string `s`. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
