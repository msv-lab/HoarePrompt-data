`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `4 ≤ n ≤ 255`, the new value of `n` must also satisfy this condition. The variable `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255**
