The function `func` accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. The function processes the string `s` as follows:

1. It counts the occurrences of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in `s`, ignoring '?' characters.
2. It calculates the average count (`avg`) of each nucleotide, which is `n // 4`.
3. It replaces each '?' in `s` with one of 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each nucleotide is used exactly `n // 4` times.
4. After replacing the '?' characters, it checks if all nucleotide counts are zero. If not, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the modified string `res`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` and replace all '?' characters in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each nucleotide appears exactly `n // 4` times. If this is not possible, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the modified string `s`.
