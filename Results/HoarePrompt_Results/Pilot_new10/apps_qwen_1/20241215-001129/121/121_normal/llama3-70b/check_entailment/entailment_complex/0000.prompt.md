You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and s is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, `count` is a dictionary where `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, and `count['T']` are non-negative integers, and for every character `c` in the string `s` that is not '?', `count[c]` is incremented by 1.
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 255\), `avg = n // 4\), `count['A']` is `n // 4 - count['A']`, `count['C']` is `n // 4 - count['C']`, `count['G']` is `n // 4 - count['G']`, and `count['T']` is `n // 4 - count['T']`.
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a string where every '?' in `s` is replaced by one of 'ACGT' such that each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') is used exactly `n // 4` times, `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are all 0, and `res` contains all other characters from `s` as they appear.
    if any(count.values()) :
        print('===')
    else :
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `res` is a string where every '?' in `s` is replaced by one of 'ACGT' such that each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') is used exactly `n // 4` times, and `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are all 0. The string `res` contains all other characters from `s` as they appear.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` and replaces all '?' in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T' such that each nucleotide appears exactly `n // 4` times. If this is not possible, it prints '==='; otherwise, it prints the modified string `s`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
