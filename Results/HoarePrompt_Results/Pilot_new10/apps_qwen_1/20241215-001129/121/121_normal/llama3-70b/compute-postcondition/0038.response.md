`nc` is assigned the value 'T', and `count` is a dictionary that contains the count of nucleotides. The line `count[nc] -= 1` decrements the count of 'T' by 1. Since `nc` is 'T', this means the count of 'T' in the dictionary `count` is decreased by 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`c` is an integer or character with the current value being '?', `'ACGT'` must exist and be non-empty, `nc` is 'T', `res` is 'CT', `count['T']` is decreased by 1**
