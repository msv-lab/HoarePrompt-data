Postcondition: ***`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` must have at least one count greater than 0. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, `res` is incremented by `nc` and `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. No changes occur if the else part is executed since there is no else part provided.***
