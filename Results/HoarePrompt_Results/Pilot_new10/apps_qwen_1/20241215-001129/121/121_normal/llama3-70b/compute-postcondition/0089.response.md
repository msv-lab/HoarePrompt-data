The code `print('===')` prints the string '===' to the console. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `res`, `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']`, and the condition `any(count.values())` remains true since the print statement does not modify these variables.

Output State: **`res` is a string where every '?' in `s` is replaced by one of 'ACGT' such that each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') is used exactly `n // 4` times, `count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` are all 0, and `res` contains all other characters from `s` as they appear. The condition `any(count.values())` is true.**
