Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. The program correctly decodes the genome by ensuring that each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') appears exactly `n // 4` times, replacing '?' characters as necessary. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points, confirming that the logic is sound. The original assessment of correctness being True is accurate because the provided code handles all valid cases as per the problem statement.
