Postcondition: **`c` is an integer or character with the current value being '?', `'ACGT'` must exist and be non-empty. If `nc` is greater than 0, `res` is its current value plus `nc_val`, and `count[nc]` is decreased by 1. If `nc` is not greater than 0, no changes occur to `res` and `count[nc]` remains unchanged.**
