Postcondition: **`count['A']`, `count['C']`, `count['G']`, `count['T']` must have at least one count greater than 0. If `count[nc]` is greater than 0, then `res` is the original value of `res` plus `nc`, `count[nc]` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or switch statement.**
