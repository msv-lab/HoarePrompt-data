Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the original assessment. The program correctly decodes the genome by ensuring that each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') appears exactly `n // 4` times, replacing '?' with appropriate nucleotides. The logic in the program is sound and covers all necessary steps as per the problem description. The annotations also support this by detailing the state of the program at various points, confirming that the program behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
