Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0
   - `dp[n]` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through all possible `j` such that `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` and updating `dp[i]` accordingly
   - `cakes` remains unchanged

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented from `n` to `n+1` but since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, `i` cannot be `n` anymore.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` should be `1` (the first iteration) if it was `n` at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - Since `i` changes, `j` will still range from `0` to `n-1` as it is not directly dependent on `i`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is a constant for the loop.
   - `dp[n]` will be updated based on the new `i` value in the next iteration.
   - `cakes` remains unchanged.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` should be `1` (the first iteration of the loop).
   - `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `n` is still a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `dp[n]` will be updated in the next iteration based on the new `i` value.
   - `cakes` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[n]` is the maximum value obtained by iterating through all possible `j` such that `(cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2])` and updating `dp[i]` accordingly, and `cakes` remains unchanged.**
