The code `dp[i] = volumes[i]` assigns the value of `volumes[i]` to `dp[i]`. This means that the value of `dp[i]` is now the same as `volumes[i]`. However, the values of other variables such as `volumes` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, the values of `volumes` and `i` remain unchanged.**
