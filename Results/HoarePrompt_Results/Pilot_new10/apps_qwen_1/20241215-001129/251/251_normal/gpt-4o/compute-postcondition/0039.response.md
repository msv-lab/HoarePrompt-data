Postcondition: ***`total` is [previous total], `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`, assuming `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`. Since there is no else part, the value of `dp[i]` remains unchanged if the condition `volumes[j] < volumes[i]` is not met.***
