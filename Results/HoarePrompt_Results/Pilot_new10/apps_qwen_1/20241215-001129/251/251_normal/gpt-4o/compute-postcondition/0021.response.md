Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`.
   - `i` must be greater than 0.
   - If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1` (inclusive).

3. **Loop Body:**
   - For each `j` in the range, the loop updates `dp[i]` if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`. Otherwise, no change occurs.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value greater than 0.
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is incremented by 1, making the new `i` value `i+1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must iterate from `0` to `i` (new value of `i`).

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` must be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Since there is no condition that changes `dp[i]` unless `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, `dp[i]` remains as it was before the loop.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` must be greater than 1 (since the previous `i` was greater than 0 and we increment it).
- The condition for updating `dp[i]` remains the same, but since we are moving to the next `i`, `dp[i]` is still equal to `volumes[i]` if no update occurred during the previous iteration.

**State: **`dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, `i` must be greater than 1**.
