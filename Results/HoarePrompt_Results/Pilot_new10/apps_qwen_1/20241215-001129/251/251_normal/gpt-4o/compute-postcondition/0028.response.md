Let's break down the problem step by step.

Given:
- The for loop is defined as: `for i in range(n):`
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by `1` with each iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume the current values are `total` (which remains unchanged), `i` is some value `k`, and `n` is known but unspecified.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - The `total` remains the same.
   - `i` is now `k + 1`.
   - `n` must remain the same and must be greater than `k + 1` for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
State: **`total` is [previous total], `i` is [previous i + 1], `n` must be greater than [previous i + 1]**.

Since the specific values of `total` and `n` were not provided, we use placeholders.

Final Answer:
State: **`total` is [previous total], `i` is [previous i + 1], `n` must be greater than [previous i + 1]**.
