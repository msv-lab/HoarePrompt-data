Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem description, the cake stacking should be done in such a way that the volume of the cake being placed on top must be strictly greater than the volume of the cake below it. However, the code simply calculates the volume of each cake and uses dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of volumes without considering the volume constraints for stacking.

The `func_1` function calculates the maximum possible volume that can be achieved by selecting a subset of the given cakes, but it does not ensure that the volume of the current cake is strictly greater than the volume of the previous cake in the stack. This violates the requirement specified in the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 1
9 7
1 4
```
The correct output should be the maximum volume of the cake that can be formed by stacking cakes with volumes 63π and π, which is approximately 197.920337. However, the current implementation would incorrectly calculate the maximum sum of volumes, which is the sum of all three cakes, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the code needs to implement a stack-based approach to ensure that the volume of the current cake is strictly greater than the volume of the previous cake in the stack.
