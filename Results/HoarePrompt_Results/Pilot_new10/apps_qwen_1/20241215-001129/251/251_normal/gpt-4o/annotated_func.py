    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the list 'dp'
#Overall this is what the function does:Let's analyze the provided annotated code and the return postconditions step by step:

1. **Parameters and Input**:
   - The function `func_1` accepts two parameters:
     - `n`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\).
     - `cakes`: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius (\(r_i\)) and height (\(h_i\)) of a cake. Specifically, \(1 \leq r_i, h_i \leq 10000\).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The first line calculates the volume of each cake using the formula \( \pi r^2 h \) and stores these volumes in a list called `volumes`.
   - A dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with zeros.
   - For each cake (indexed by `i`), the volume of the current cake is added to `dp[i]`.
   - For each previous cake (indexed by `j`), if the volume of the previous cake is less than the current cake, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the sum of `dp[j]` and the volume of the current cake.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the maximum value among the elements in the list `dp`.

4. **Annotations vs. Actual Code**:
   - The annotations suggest that the code calculates the maximum value considering some form of dependency between cakes, but the actual code only sums the volumes without considering dependencies.
   - The `dp` array is used to store the cumulative maximum volume achievable up to each cake index without explicitly considering the dependency mentioned in the annotations.

5. **Functionality Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible volume that can be achieved by selecting a subset of the given cakes, where the selection order is irrelevant.
   - It initializes a DP array to store the maximum volume achievable up to each cake.
   - For each cake, it updates the DP array by considering the volume of the current cake and the maximum volume achievable up to the previous cake.

Given the above analysis, the correct summary of the function's functionality is:

**Functionality: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of tuples representing cakes with their radii and heights. It calculates the maximum possible volume that can be achieved by selecting a subset of the given cakes, without considering any dependencies between the selections. It returns the maximum value among the elements in the DP array.**

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 000, and cakes is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, such that 1 <= radius[i], height[i] <= 10 000 for all 0 <= i < n.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from standard input containing the number of cakes and their dimensions, processes this input to form a list of tuples, and then calls another function `func_1` with this list. The result from `func_1` is printed with six decimal places.
