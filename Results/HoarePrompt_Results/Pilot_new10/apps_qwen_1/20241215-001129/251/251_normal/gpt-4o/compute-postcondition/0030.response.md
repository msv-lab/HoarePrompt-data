Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `total` is `[previous total]`.
   - `i` is `[previous i + 1] + 1`, which simplifies to `i = previous i + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `[previous i + 1] + 1`, which simplifies to `n > previous i + 2`.
   - `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < i`.
   - This means `j` will take values from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Required Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `j < i` must hold true.
   - Given `i = previous i + 2`, we need to ensure that `j < i` is true.

4. **Analyzing the Loop Execution:**
   - Since `i = previous i + 2`, the smallest possible value for `i` (starting from some initial value) is 2 (if `previous i` is 0).
   - Therefore, `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to start executing.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is at least 2 for the loop to start.
   - Additionally, since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`, `i` should be greater than 0 but we already know it should be at least 2 based on the given conditions.

6. **Final States:**
   - `total` is `[previous total]`.
   - `i` must be at least 2.
   - `n` must be greater than `i`, which is greater than 2.
   - `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`.

Therefore, the required states to adjust for the loop to execute are:

State: **`total` is [previous total], `i` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`**
