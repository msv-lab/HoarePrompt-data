The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, and `cakes`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius (`r_i`) and height (`h_i`) of the i-th cake such that 1 <= `r_i`, `h_i` <= 10000. The function returns the maximum value among the elements in the list 'dp'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` (a positive integer within a specific range) and a parameter `cakes` (a list of tuples, each containing the radius and height of a cake). It returns the maximum value among the elements in the list 'dp'.**
