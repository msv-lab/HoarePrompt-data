The code creates a new list `cakes` by iterating over the range of `n` and converting every 2nd and 3rd element of the `data` list into integers, which represent the radius and height of the cakes respectively. The previous values of `data` and `n` remain unchanged. The new `cakes` list is constructed based on these elements.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings starting from the second element, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the integers `int(data[2 * i + 1])` and `int(data[2 * i + 2])` for each `i` in the range `n`.**
