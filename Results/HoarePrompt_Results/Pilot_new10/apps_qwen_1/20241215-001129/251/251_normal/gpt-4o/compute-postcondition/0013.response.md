Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), `dp[0]` is `volumes[0]`, `dp[1]` is `max(volumes[0] + volumes[1], 0)`. For `i` from 2 to `n`, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])` for all `j < i`. If `volumes[j] < volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is specifically updated to `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.***
