`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10,000,000.**
