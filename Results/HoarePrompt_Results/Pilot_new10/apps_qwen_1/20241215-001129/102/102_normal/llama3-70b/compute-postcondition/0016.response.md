Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( x \) is 1
- \( y \) is \((n - a) // b\)
- The condition for the equation \( x * a + y * b == n \) must hold true for the values of \( x \) and \( y \). If it does not, the values of \( x \) and \( y \) are not specified.

### Loop Statement:
```
for x in range(n // a + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = n // a \).
2. **Current Value of \( x \)**: At the end of the previous iteration, \( x \) is 1.
3. **Next Iteration of the Loop**: For the loop to execute one more time, \( x \) needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, \( x \) will be 2 in the next iteration.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since \( x \) will be incremented by 1, the new value of \( x \) will be 2.
- The value of \( y \) is determined by the equation \( y = (n - a) // b \) and does not change within the loop unless the condition \( x * a + y * b == n \) changes. However, since the condition is not specified for the next iteration, we cannot assume any change in \( y \).

### Final State:
- \( x \) will be 2.
- \( y \) remains \((n - a) // b\).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is \((n - a) // b\)**
