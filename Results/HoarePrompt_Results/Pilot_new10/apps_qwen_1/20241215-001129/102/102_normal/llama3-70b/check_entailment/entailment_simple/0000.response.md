Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program uses a brute-force approach to check all possible values of \(x\) (the number of bottles of Ber-Cola) up to \(\frac{n}{a}\). However, this approach may miss some valid solutions due to the limitations in the range of \(x\). Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Range Limitation**: The program checks for \(x\) in the range from 0 to \(\frac{n}{a}\), which means it only considers \(x\) up to the maximum number of bottles that can be bought with the entire amount \(n\). This is insufficient because the solution might require buying more than \(\frac{n}{a}\) bottles of Ber-Cola, especially when \(a\) is large.

2. **Integer Division Issues**: The expression `n // a` gives the integer division result, which means it discards the fractional part. For example, if \(n = 10\) and \(a = 3\), \(\frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33\), but `10 // 3` will give 3. Therefore, the loop might miss valid solutions where \(x\) is greater than 3 but less than 4.

To fix this, a more robust approach would involve checking all possible combinations of \(x\) and \(y\) within the range that ensures both \(x\) and \(y\) are non-negative integers. A better solution would use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to check if the equation \(ax + by = n\) has non-negative integer solutions. This method guarantees that all possible combinations are checked without missing any valid solutions.

Here is an improved version using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:

```python
def gcd_extended(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    else:
        gcd, x1, y1 = gcd_extended(b, a % b)
        x = y1
        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
        return gcd, x, y

def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())

    # Compute the GCD of a and b
    gcd, x0, y0 = gcd_extended(a, b)

    # Check if n is divisible by the GCD
    if n % gcd != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        # Scale the solution to fit the original equation
        k = n // gcd
        x = x0 * k
        y = y0 * k

        # Ensure the solution is non-negative
        if x >= 0 and y >= 0:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This improved version correctly handles all cases by leveraging the properties of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, ensuring that all possible solutions are checked and that the final answer is valid.
