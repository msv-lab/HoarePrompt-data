The code prints 'YES', but it does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `x`, and `y`. The print statement only outputs text to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `a` is an integer input from the user, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, and the output is 'YES'**
