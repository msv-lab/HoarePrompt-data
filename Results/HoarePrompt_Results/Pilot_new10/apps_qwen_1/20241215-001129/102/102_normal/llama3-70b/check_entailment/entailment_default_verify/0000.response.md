Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to check if it's possible to buy some number of Ber-Cola bottles and Bars bars to spend exactly `n` burles. The program iterates through possible values of `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and calculates the corresponding `y` (number of Bars bars) using the formula `(n - x * a) // b`. If it finds a valid pair `(x, y)` such that `x * a + y * b == n`, it prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and exits. If no such pair is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO". This approach covers all necessary cases and aligns with the problem description and the provided output hints.
