Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not cover all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code only checks for solutions where `x * a + y * b = n` within the range of `x` from `0` to `n // a`. However, this approach may miss solutions where `y` is greater than `n // b`.

For example, consider the following case:

- Input: 
  ```
  15
  4
  8
  ```

The correct solution would be `x = 2` and `y = 1` because `2 * 4 + 1 * 8 = 16`, which is not equal to `15`. However, the current implementation will not find this solution because it only checks up to `x = 3` (since `3 * 4 = 12` and `15 - 12 = 3`, which is less than `8`).

To fix this, the code should check for solutions where `y` can be any value that makes the equation valid, not just those within a specific range. This requires iterating over possible values of `y` and checking if there exists an `x` that satisfies the equation.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    found = False
    for y in range(n // b + 1):
        x = (n - y * b) / a
        if x.is_integer() and x >= 0:
            print('YES')
            print(int(x), y)
            found = True
            break
    
    if not found:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This version iterates over possible values of `y` and checks if there exists an integer `x` that satisfies the equation `x * a + y * b = n`.
