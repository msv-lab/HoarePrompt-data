Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user, as specified in the problem description.
2. **Checking All Possible Combinations**: The program uses a nested loop to check all possible combinations of `x` (number of Ber-Cola bottles) and `y` (number of Bars bars) to see if they satisfy the equation `x * a + y * b = n`.
3. **Finding a Solution**: If a combination `(x, y)` is found such that `x * a + y * b = n`, the program prints "YES" followed by the values of `x` and `y`, and then exits using the `exit()` function.
4. **Handling No Solution**: If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, the program prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles with the given costs of Ber-Cola and Bars bars.

The key aspect of the solution is that it systematically checks all possible combinations of `x` and `y` within the bounds set by `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the problem guarantees that `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10 000 000`, the range of values for `x` and `y` is sufficiently checked to cover all possible solutions. This ensures that the program adheres to the requirements of the problem statement.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, making it **True**.
