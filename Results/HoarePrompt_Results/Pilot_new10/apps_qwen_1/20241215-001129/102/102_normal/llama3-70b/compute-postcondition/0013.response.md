The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is initially 1 and `y` is `(n - a) // b`, where `n` is an integer obtained from `int(input())` and `a` is an integer input from the user, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged after printing. No new variables are assigned values.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is (n - a) // b**
