The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. Given the initial conditions:
- `a` is a positive integer,
- `n // a` is at least 1,
- `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) % b != 0` holds true,
- `x` is `k + 1` where `k < n // a`,
- `y` is `(n - (k + 1) * a) // b`,
- the printed value is 'YES'.

The code `print(x, y)` simply outputs the values of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are not changed by this print statement, only output.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state in terms of the values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the condition checks, except for the print statement which outputs `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `n` is such that `n // a` is at least 1, and the expression `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) % b != 0` holds true; `x` is `k + 1` where `k < n // a`; `y` is `(n - (k + 1) * a) // b`; printed value is 'YES', and x and y are printed.**
