The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `1 <= n, a, b <= 10 000 000` still holds. However, the specific value of `n` is now determined by the user's input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer; 1 <= `n` <= 10 000 000**
