The code `print('YES')` does not change any variable values but prints 'YES' to the console. The conditions and values of the variables before the print statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `n` must be such that `n // a` is at least 1, and the expression `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) % b != 0` holds true; `y` is calculated as `(n - x * a) // b`, and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
