`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `b` remains unchanged, and the condition `1 <= n <= 10 000 000` is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer; 1 <= n <= 10 000 000, `a` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an integer; 1 <= n <= 10 000 000**
