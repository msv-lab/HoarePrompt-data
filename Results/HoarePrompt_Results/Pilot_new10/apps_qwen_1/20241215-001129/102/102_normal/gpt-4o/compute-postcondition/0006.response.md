The `print('YES')` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only outputs text to the console. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `b`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `n` must be such that `n // a` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `b` is a divisor of `(n - x * a)`, `y` is an integer equal to `(n - x * a) // b`, and `(n - x * a) % b == 0`; prints 'YES'**
