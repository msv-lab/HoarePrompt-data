The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console but does not affect the values of the variables `a`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `n` is such that `n // a` is at least 1, and the expression `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) % b != 0` holds true; `x` is `k + 1` where `k < n // a`; `y` is `(n - (k + 1) * a) // b`; printed value is 'YES'**
