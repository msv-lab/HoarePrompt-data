Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial value:**
   - The loop variable is `x`.
   - The loop runs for values of `x` from 0 to `n // a`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than or equal to `n // a`.
   - Therefore, `n // a` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Identify the necessary adjustments:**
   - The initial value of `x` is 0.
   - The value of `a` should be a positive integer to ensure `n // a` is a non-negative integer.
   - The value of `n` should be such that `n // a` is at least 1.

Based on this analysis, we need to adjust the following states:
- Ensure `a` is a positive integer.
- Ensure `n // a` is at least 1.

Here is the final state:

**State: `a` is a positive integer, `n` must be such that `n // a` is at least 1**
