`y` is assigned the value of `(n - x * a) // b`. The value of `x` is `k + 1` where `k < n // a`. Given this, let's denote `x = k + 1` and substitute it into the equation:

\[ y = \left(n - (k + 1) \cdot a\right) // b \]

Since the initial state tells us that `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) % b != 0`, we know that `n` is not exactly divisible by `a` plus one additional multiple of `a`.

Therefore, the updated state after the code execution is:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `n` is such that `n // a` is at least 1, and the expression `(n - (n // a + 1) * a) % b != 0` holds true; `x` is `k + 1` where `k < n // a`; `y` is `(n - (k + 1) * a) // b`.**
