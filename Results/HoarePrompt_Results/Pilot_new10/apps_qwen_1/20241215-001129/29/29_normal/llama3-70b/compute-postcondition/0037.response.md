Output State: **`script` is a list of length equal to the number of lines printed, `line` is the last value printed, and the output is the value of `line`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `script` is a list of length 0.
   - `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`.
   - `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1.
   - `regular` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for line in script:
       print(line)
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `script` and prints it.
   - For the loop to execute, `script` must have at least one element.
   - After the loop finishes executing, `line` will be the last value that was printed.

4. **Final State Analysis**:
   - If the loop executes, it means `script` had at least one element, and it iterated over all elements, printing each one.
   - After the loop, `line` will be the value of the last element in `script` that was printed.
   - `script` will retain the list of all elements that were printed, so its length will be equal to the number of times the loop executed (i.e., the number of elements in `script`).

5. **Case When the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If the loop does not execute, `script` remains an empty list, and no value is printed.
   - In this case, `line` will be undefined since no value was printed.

Thus, the final output state captures the condition that `script` contains all the elements that were printed and `line` holds the value of the last printed element.
