The code creates a new list `examples` containing the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1. The original list `files` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `examples` and the unchanged value of `files`.

Output State: **`files` is a list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1**.
