According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 and within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Since `n` is an integer input from the user, we need to ensure that `n` is a valid integer and falls within this range.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input from the user in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `files` is an empty list

For the loop to execute, `n` must be a valid integer and within the specified range.

State: **`n` is a valid integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `files` is an empty list**
