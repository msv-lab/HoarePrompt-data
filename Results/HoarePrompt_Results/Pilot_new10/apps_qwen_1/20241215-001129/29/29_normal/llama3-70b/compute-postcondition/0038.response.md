The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to process a set of filenames and their corresponding test types (either "1" for examples or "0" for regular tests), where the number of such sets is given by an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). Each set consists of a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with lengths from 1 to 6 characters) followed by a test type.
