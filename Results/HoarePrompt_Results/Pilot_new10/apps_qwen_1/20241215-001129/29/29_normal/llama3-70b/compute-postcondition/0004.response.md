`files` is an empty list before the code execution. After executing `files.append((name, int(type_)))`, the list `files` will contain one tuple with the values of `name` and `int(type_)`. The variables `name` and `type_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `files` is a list containing one tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)), `name` is a string from the input, `type_` is a string from the input**
