Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `files`: A list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value of each tuple.
   - `examples`: A list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1.
   - `regular`: A list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 0.
   - `script`: An empty list.

2. **For Loop Statement Analysis:**
   ```python
   for (i, file) in enumerate(examples, start=1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   - The loop iterates over the `examples` list.
   - `enumerate` is used with `start=1`, meaning the index starts from 1, not 0.

3. **Determining the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `examples` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over this list.
   - Since the loop uses `enumerate` starting from 1, the first element of `examples` should be accessed with an index of 1.

4. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Ensure `examples` is not empty.
   - `i` will start from 1, so the first element in `examples` will be accessed when `i` is 1.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments are:
- `examples` must have at least one element.
- `i` will start from 1, and the corresponding `file` will be the first element of `examples`.

**Final State:**
State: **`examples` must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `file` is the first element of `examples`**
