The code `files.append((name, int(type_)))` appends a tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the list `files`. Since `name` is a string and `type_` is an integer, the tuple added to `files` will be a combination of a string and an integer. The values of `n` and the existing elements in `files` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list containing \(n-1\) tuples plus one additional tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)).**
