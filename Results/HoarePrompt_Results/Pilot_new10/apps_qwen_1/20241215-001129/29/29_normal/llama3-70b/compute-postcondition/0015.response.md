The code initializes an empty list named `script`. The initial states of `files`, `examples`, and `regular` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `script` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`files` is a list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1; `regular` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 0; `script` is an empty list.**
