The code creates a new list `regular` which contains the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 0. This means that `regular` is a list of the first elements (which are stored in the variable name `file[0]`) of tuples in `files` where the second element (which is stored in the variable name `file[1]`) is 0.

After executing the code, the value of `files` remains unchanged because the code does not modify the original `files` list, only creates a new list `regular` based on its contents.

Therefore, the Output State is: `files` is a list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1; `regular` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 0.

Output State: **`files` is a list of `n` tuples, sorted in descending order based on the `type_` value of each tuple; `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1; `regular` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 0.**
