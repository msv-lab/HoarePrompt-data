The code `print(len(script))` prints the length of the `script` list. Since `script` is a list containing commands to move each file in `regular` to its corresponding position, and `regular` is an empty list, the length of `script` is 0.

Output State: **`script` is a list of length 0, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`, `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1, `regular` is an empty list.**
