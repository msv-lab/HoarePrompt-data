Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates from 0 to \(n-1\). This means the loop will execute \(n\) times.

2. **Current State Analysis**: 
   - `n` is a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `files` is a list containing \(n-1\) tuples plus one additional tuple. Therefore, the length of `files` is \(n\).

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration (the \((n-1)\)-th iteration), we need to determine the state for the \(n\)-th iteration.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop runs \(n\) times, after the \((n-1)\)-th iteration, the loop will run one more time for the \(n\)-th iteration.
   - There is no change to `n` inside the loop, as it is used only as the range limit and does not get modified within the loop.
   - The `files` list length remains \(n\).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list containing \(n-1\) tuples plus one additional tuple (`name`, int(`type_`))**
