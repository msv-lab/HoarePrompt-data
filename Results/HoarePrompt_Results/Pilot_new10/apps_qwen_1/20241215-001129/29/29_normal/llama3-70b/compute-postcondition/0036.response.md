The code `print(line)` prints the value of the variable `line`. Since `line` is the first element of the list `script` in the initial state, printing `line` does not change the value of `line` itself, but it outputs its value. The output state remains the same in terms of the value of `line`, but now we know that its value has been printed.

Output State: **`script` must have at least one element, `line` is its first element, and the value of `line` has been printed.**
