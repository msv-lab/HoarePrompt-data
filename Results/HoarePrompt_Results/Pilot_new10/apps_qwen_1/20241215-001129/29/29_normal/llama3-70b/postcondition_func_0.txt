The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` filenames along with their test types. It then sorts the filenames based on their test types in descending order, where "1" represents examples and "0" represents regular tests. It generates a script of commands to move each example file to positions based on their index and then moves each regular test file to the next available positions. Finally, it prints the length of the script followed by each command in the script.
