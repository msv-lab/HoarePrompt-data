The code `name, type_ = input().split()` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `name` and `type_` respectively. Since the input is a single line, `input()` reads this line and `split()` separates it into `name` and `type_`. The initial state of `n` being a valid integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `files` being an empty list remains unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a valid integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `files` is an empty list, `name` is a string from the input, `type_` is a string from the input**
