Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `files` is a list containing one tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)), where `name` is a string from the input and `type_` is a string from the input.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times using the `range(n)` function.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration, the loop body is executed, but since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider how the variables `n` and `files` change or remain constant within each iteration.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - The variable `n` is fixed at the beginning of the loop and does not change within the loop iterations. Therefore, the value of `n` remains the same for each iteration.
   - The list `files` is also fixed and does not change within the loop. Each iteration processes one element of the list.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `n` is the number of iterations and it does not change, the only thing that changes is the position within the list `files`.
   - After the first iteration, `files` is still the same list, but now one element (tuple) has been processed.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the fact that one iteration has been completed, and the loop will continue to process the remaining elements in the `files` list until all `n` elements have been processed.

**State:**
- `n` is still a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `files` is still a list containing one tuple (`name`, int(`type_`)), but now one tuple has been processed, meaning there are \(n-1\) tuples left to process.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**State: **`n` is a valid integer in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `files` is a list containing \(n-1\) tuples (`name`, int(`type_`))**.
