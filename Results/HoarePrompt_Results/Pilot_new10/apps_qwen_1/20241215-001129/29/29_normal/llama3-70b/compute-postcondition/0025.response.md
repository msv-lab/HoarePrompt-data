Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States
- `script` is a list containing strings like 'move file1 (len(examples) + 1)', 'move file2 (len(examples) + 2)', ..., 'move fileN (len(examples) + N)'.
- `i` is `len(examples) + N + 1`.
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1.
- `regular` is a non-empty list with at least one element.

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for (i, file) in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the `enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1)` expression. This means that the loop starts iterating from `i = len(examples) + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently `len(examples) + N + 1`.
   - The loop is checking if there are more elements in `regular` starting from `len(examples) + 1`.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which starts at `len(examples) + 1`) should be less than the length of `regular`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue until `i` is equal to or exceeds the length of `regular`.

Given the current state where `i` is `len(examples) + N + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `regular`.

### Updated States
- Since `i` is currently `len(examples) + N + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `len(examples) + N + 2` (i.e., `i` should be `len(examples) + N + 2`).
- Therefore, the condition for the next iteration is that `i` must be `len(examples) + N + 2`.

### Final State
- `i` must be `len(examples) + N + 2`.
- The length of `regular` must be greater than `len(examples) + N + 1`.

Thus, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is `len(examples) + N + 2`, `regular` must have at least `len(examples) + N + 2` elements**.
