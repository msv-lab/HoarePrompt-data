According to the code, the loop iterates over the `examples` list with an enumeration that starts from 1. The loop variable `i` represents the index of the current item in the `examples` list, starting from 1, and `file` represents the current file in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `script` contains the additional element `f'move {file_value} {i_current + 1}'`
- `i` is `i_current + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `i` must be less than the length of `examples` plus 1 (since the loop starts from 1).
2. The next value of `i` will be `i_current + 2`.

Given this information, we need to update the state to reflect these changes:
- `script` will contain the additional element `f'move {file_value} {i_current + 2}'` (since `i` increases by 1).
- `i` will be `i_current + 2`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`script` contains the additional element `f'move {file_value} {i_current + 2}'`, `i` is `i_current + 2`**
