Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `script` is a list containing commands to move each file in `examples` to its corresponding position.
- `i` is the total number of files in `examples`.
- `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1.
- `regular` is a non-empty list with at least one element.

### Loop Code
```python
for i, file in enumerate(regular, start=len(examples) + 1):
    script.append(f'move {file} {i}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initially, `i` is set to the total number of files in `examples`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `regular` starting from the index `len(examples) + 1`.
   - For each element `file` in `regular`, a command to move `file` to position `i` is appended to `script`.
   - After appending the command, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Final State:**
   - The loop continues until there are no more elements in `regular` to process.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute exactly `len(regular)` times.
   - After the loop, `i` will be `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`.

### Output State After All Iterations

- **`script`:** 
  - `script` will contain a list of commands to move each file in `regular` to its corresponding position, starting from `len(examples) + 1` up to `len(examples) + len(regular)`.
  - Specifically, `script` will contain `['move file1 (len(examples) + 1)', 'move file2 (len(examples) + 2)', ..., 'move fileN (len(examples) + N)']`, where `N = len(regular)`.

- **`i`:** 
  - `i` will be `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`.

- **`examples`:**
  - `examples` remains unchanged and is still a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1.

- **`regular`:**
  - `regular` will be an empty list since the loop processes all elements of `regular`.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`script` is a list containing commands to move each file in `regular` to its corresponding position, `i` is `len(examples) + len(regular) + 1`, `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element of each tuple is equal to 1, `regular` is an empty list.**
