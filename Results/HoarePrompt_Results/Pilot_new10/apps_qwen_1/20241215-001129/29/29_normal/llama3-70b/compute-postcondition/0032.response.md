The code `print(line)` prints the value of the variable `line`. Since the initial state is that `script` must have at least one element, this does not directly affect the value of `line`. The output of the print statement will be the value of `line`, but the value of `line` itself is not changed by the print statement. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`script` must have at least one element, `line` is its value, and the output is the value of `line`.**
