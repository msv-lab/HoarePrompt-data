The code splits the string `file` into two parts using the `split()` method, assigning the first part to `name` and the second part to `type_`. This changes the values of `name` and `type_`, while `files` remains unchanged because no operation affects it.

Before the split, `file` is the first element in the `files` list and is a string containing both `name` and `type_` separated by a space (or another delimiter by default). After the split, `name` will be the first part of this string, and `type_` will be the second part.

Output State: **`files` must contain at least one element, `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list, `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.**
