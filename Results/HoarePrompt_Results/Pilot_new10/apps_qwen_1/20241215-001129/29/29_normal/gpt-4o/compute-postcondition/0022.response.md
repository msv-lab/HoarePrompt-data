Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `examples` using `enumerate`, meaning it uses `index` (`i`) and `student` (which here would be `student` in `examples`).
   - The loop variable is `i`, which is derived from `range(len(examples))`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `len(examples)` must be at least 1. This ensures there is at least one element to iterate over.

3. **Adjust the Given States:**
   - `n`: The value of `n` does not directly affect the execution of the loop since the loop is based on `len(examples)`.
   - `files`: The state of `files` is irrelevant to the loop execution.
   - `regulars`: The state of `regulars` is irrelevant to the loop execution.
   - `examples`: There must be at least one file in `examples` for the loop to execute.
   - `moves`: The state of `moves` is irrelevant to the loop execution.
   - `temp_counter`: The value of `temp_counter` does not affect the loop execution.

4. **Formulate the Adjusted State:**
   - We need to ensure `examples` has at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0, as the loop starts from the first element of `examples`.

Given these points, the final state should be:

**State: `n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is an empty list, `regulars` is a list containing the names of all files with type '0', `examples` is a list containing at least one file with type '1', `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, `i` is 0.**
