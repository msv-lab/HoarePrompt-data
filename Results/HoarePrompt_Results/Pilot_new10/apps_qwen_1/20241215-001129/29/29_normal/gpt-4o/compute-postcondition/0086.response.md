Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Variables and Conditions:**
   - `regulars` contains at least one element.
   - `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.
   - If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter - 1)` is in `files_set`.
   - `moves` now contains the string `'move {regulars[i]} {target}'` appended to it.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(len(regulars))`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(regulars)`.

3. **Update States:**
   - `i` will increment by 1 from its current value.
   - `target` will update to `len(examples) + (i + 1) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` will increase by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `target` will be updated to `len(examples) + (i + 1) + 1`.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `regulars` still contains at least one element.
   - `target` will be `len(examples) + (i + 1) + 1`.
   - `temp_counter` and `files_set` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified inside the loop body, but since we are only concerned with the loop starting condition, these do not change here.
   - `moves` remains as it was updated in the previous iteration.

State: **`regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + (i + 1) + 1`, `temp_counter` is unchanged, `files_set` is unchanged, `moves` is unchanged.**
