To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information:

1. The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is:
   - `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`
   - `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`
   - `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`

2. The loop condition is:
   ```
   while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
   ```

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop must be true after the adjustment:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`

Given the initial state, we know:
- `temp_counter` is already `temp_counter + 1`
- `temp_counter` is currently less than or equal to `2 * n`
- `str(temp_counter)` is currently in `files_set`

For the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must still satisfy both conditions after the adjustment. Since `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` already, it must remain within the bounds and still have its string representation in `files_set`.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed because the current state already satisfies the loop conditions.

However, to clearly express the state required for the loop to execute one more time, we can reiterate the necessary conditions:
- `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`

Since these conditions are already met, the state remains as given.

**State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**
