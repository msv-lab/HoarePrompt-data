The code appends the value of `name` to the list `regulars`. Since `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting and `file` is the first element in the `files` list, `name` is specifically the first part of the first file name in the `files` list.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files; `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element; `regulars` is a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list; `examples` is an empty list; `file` is the first element in the `files` list; `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting; `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting and is not equal to '1'.**
