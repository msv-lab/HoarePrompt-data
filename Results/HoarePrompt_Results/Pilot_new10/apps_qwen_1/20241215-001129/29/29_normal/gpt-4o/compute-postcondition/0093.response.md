`temp_counter` is initially equal to its previous value plus 2, and it must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`. The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. So, the new value of `temp_counter` will be its previous value plus 3.

Given these conditions, the updated value of `temp_counter` is its previous value (which was already plus 2) plus 1, making it plus 3. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 3, and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
