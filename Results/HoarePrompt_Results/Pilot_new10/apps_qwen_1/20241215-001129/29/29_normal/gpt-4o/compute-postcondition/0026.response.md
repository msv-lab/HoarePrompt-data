To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues to run.

The given `while` loop condition is:
```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

From the provided information:
- `examples` has at least one element.
- The initial value of `i` is 0.
- The current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to '1'.
- `temp_counter` is 2.
- `1` is in `files_set`.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to `2`.

2. **Condition 2:** `str(temp_counter) in files_set`
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is 2.
   - Therefore, `"2"` must be in `files_set`.

Since both conditions need to be satisfied for the loop to continue, let's check if these conditions are met based on the provided state:

- `temp_counter` is currently 2.
- `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to `2`.
- `"2"` must be in `files_set`.

Given that `temp_counter` is already 2, and `"2"` is in `files_set`, the only condition that might change is `2 * n`. To ensure the loop can continue, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to `2`, which is already true because `n` is a positive integer (since `examples` has at least one element).

Thus, no additional adjustments to the states are necessary. The loop can proceed as is.

State: **`examples` has at least one element, the initial value of `i` is 0, the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to '1', `temp_counter` is 2, and `1` is in `files_set`**
