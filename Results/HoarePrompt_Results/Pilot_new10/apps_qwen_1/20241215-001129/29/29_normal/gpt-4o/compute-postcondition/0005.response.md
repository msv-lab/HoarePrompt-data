`examples.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the list `examples`. Since `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting and the condition `type_ == '1'` is true, the value of `name` is added to `examples`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files; `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element; `regulars` is an empty list; `examples` is a list containing the name of the file; `file` is the first element in the `files` list; `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting; `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting and it is equal to '1'.**
