Postcondition: **`files` must contain at least one element, `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list, `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` contains the value of `name` as its last element. Otherwise, `regulars` contains the name appended to the original contents.**
