The code snippet appends a string to the list `moves`. Specifically, it appends a formatted string that includes the value of `regulars[i]` and `temp_counter`.

Given the initial state:
- `temp_counter` is the maximum value such that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
- `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `temp_counter` remains unchanged because the code does not modify its value.
- The value of `regulars[i]` is used in the string being appended to `moves`, but no specific value for `regulars[i]` is given, so we cannot determine its exact value.

Therefore, the only updated information is related to the `moves` list, which now contains a new element.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is the maximum value such that `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`; `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`; `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`; `moves` contains the string 'move [regulars[i]] [temp_counter]'**
