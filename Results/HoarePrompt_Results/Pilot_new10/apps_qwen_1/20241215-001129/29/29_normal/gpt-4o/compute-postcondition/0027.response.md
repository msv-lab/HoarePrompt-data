`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `temp_counter` is 2, so after the increment, `temp_counter` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `examples` has at least one element, the initial value of `i` is 0, the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to '1', `temp_counter` is 3, and `1` is in `files_set`.

Output State: **`examples` has at least one element, the initial value of `i` is 0, the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to '1', `temp_counter` is 3, and `1` is in `files_set`**
