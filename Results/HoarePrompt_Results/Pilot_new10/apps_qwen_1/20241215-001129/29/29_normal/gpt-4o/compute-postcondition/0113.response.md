`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Given that `temp_counter` was initially greater than `2 * n` and is the last number for which `str(temp_counter)` was in `files_set`, the new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter)`, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `files_set` remains unchanged, `moves` now includes the string `'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}'`.**
