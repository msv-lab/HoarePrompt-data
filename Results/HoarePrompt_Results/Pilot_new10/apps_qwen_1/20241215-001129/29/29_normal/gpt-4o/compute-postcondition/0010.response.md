The code splits the first element of the `files` list into two parts: `name` and `type_`. Before the split, `name` and `type_` are undefined. After the split, `name` will be the first part of the first file name in the `files` list, and `type_` will be the second part.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of files minus one;
- `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element;
- `regulars` is either an empty list or a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list;
- `examples` is either an empty list or a list containing the name of the file;
- `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list (the first element before the split);
- `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting;
- `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.

After executing the line of code, the values of `name` and `type_` will be updated, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files minus one; `files` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element; `regulars` is either an empty list or a list containing the first part of the first file name in the `files` list; `examples` is either an empty list or a list containing the name of the file; `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list; `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting; `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting.**
