Let's analyze the given loop and the provided program state step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 2)`
   - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 3`
   - `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`
   - `str(2 * n + 2)` must be in `files_set`
   - `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`

3. **Check Loop Conditions**:
   - For the loop to continue, two conditions must hold:
     1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`
     2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`

4. **Evaluate Initial Values**:
   - Given `temp_counter = 2 * n + 3`, we know `temp_counter > 2 * n`.
   - Therefore, the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` is false.

Since the first condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` is already false, the loop cannot continue to execute based on the current values of the variables.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To make the loop execute one more time, we need to change the value of `temp_counter` such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` holds true while ensuring `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`.

Given that `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` and `temp_counter` needs to be less than or equal to `2 * n`, we need to reduce `temp_counter` to a value that satisfies both conditions.

The adjusted state should reflect that `temp_counter` has been reduced to a value within the required range.

**State**: **`examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 2)`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`, `str(2 * n + 2)` must be in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`**
