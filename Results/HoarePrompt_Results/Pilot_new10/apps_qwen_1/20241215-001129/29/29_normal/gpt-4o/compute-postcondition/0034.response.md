Postcondition: **`examples` has at least one element, the initial value of `i` is 0, and the following conditions hold:
- If `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, then `examples[i]` remains unchanged, `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`, `str(2 * n)` is in `files_set`, and `moves` contains the string `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'`.
- If `examples[i]` is equal to `str(i + 1)`, then no changes are made to `examples[i]`, `temp_counter`, `files_set`, and `moves` remains unchanged.**
