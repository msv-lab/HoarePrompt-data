The code appends the `name` (the first part of `file` after splitting) to the `regulars` list. Initially, `files` contains at least one element, `file` is the first element in the `files` list, and `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting. After executing the code, the `regulars` list will have the `name` appended to it.

Output State: **`files` must contain at least one element, `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list, `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting, `regulars` contains the name appended to the original contents**
