The code snippet `temp_counter += 1` increments the value of `temp_counter` by 1. This operation updates the value of `temp_counter` to be one more than its previous value. 

Given the precondition that `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` for the loop to continue, after incrementing `temp_counter` by 1, the new condition for the loop to continue is that the new value of `temp_counter` (which is `temp_counter + 1`) must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`temp_counter` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to 2 * n and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**
