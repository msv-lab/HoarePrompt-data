To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the conditions under which the loop will start executing.

### Initial Conditions
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`
- If `examples[i]` is `2 * n + 1`, then:
  - `temp_counter` is `2 * n + 2`
  - `str(2 * n)` and `str(2 * n + 1)` are in `files_set`
  - `moves` contains the strings `'move {str(2 * n + 1)} {2 * n + 1}'` and `f'move {examples[i]} {i + 1}'`
- If `examples[i]` is not `2 * n + 1`, no changes are made to the variables, and `moves` contains the initial two strings.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - We need to ensure that both conditions (`temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`) are satisfied when the loop starts.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - Additionally, `str(temp_counter)` must be present in `files_set`.

4. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `temp_counter` is already set to a value that satisfies `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`, the loop will execute.
   - If `temp_counter` is not yet set or does not meet these conditions, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the initial state of `temp_counter` is not specified, we need to assume the worst-case scenario where `temp_counter` is not yet set or does not meet the loop condition.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure `temp_counter` is set to a value such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `temp_counter` is set to a value that satisfies both conditions of the loop. Specifically, `temp_counter` should be set to a value less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` should be in `files_set`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, `temp_counter` is set to a value less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`**
