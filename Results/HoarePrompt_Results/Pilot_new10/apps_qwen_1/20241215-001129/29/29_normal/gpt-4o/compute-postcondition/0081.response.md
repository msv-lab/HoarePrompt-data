`temp_counter` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`; `str(temp_counter - 1)` is in `files_set`; `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`; `str(temp_counter - 1)` is in `files_set`; `regulars[i]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)`**
