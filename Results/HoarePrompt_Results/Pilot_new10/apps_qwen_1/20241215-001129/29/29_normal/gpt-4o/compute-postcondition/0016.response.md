The code `examples.append(name)` appends the value of `name` to the list `examples`. Given the initial state, the value of `name` is the first part of the first element in the `files` list after splitting. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.

Output State: **`files` must contain at least one element, `file` is the first element in the updated `files` list, `name` is the first part of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of `file` after splitting, `examples` contains the value of `name` as its last element.**
