`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `temp_counter` must be set to a value such that `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. After incrementing `temp_counter` by 1, the new value of `temp_counter` will still satisfy the condition since it was initially within the bounds and the operation of adding 1 does not affect the membership in `files_set`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter` <= 2 * n and str(`temp_counter`) is in `files_set`**
