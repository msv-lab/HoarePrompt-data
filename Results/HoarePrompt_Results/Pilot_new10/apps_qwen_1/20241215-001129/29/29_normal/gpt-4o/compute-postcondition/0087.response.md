The code sets `target` to the value of `len(examples) + i + 1`. The previous value of `target` was `len(examples) + (i + 1) + 1`, so after executing the code, the new value of `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` is unchanged, `files_set` is unchanged, `moves` is unchanged.**
