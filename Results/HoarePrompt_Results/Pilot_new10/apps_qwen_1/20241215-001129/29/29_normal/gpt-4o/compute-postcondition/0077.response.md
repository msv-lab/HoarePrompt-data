`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial condition that `temp_counter + 3` is less than or equal to `2 * n` remains valid. Also, the presence of `str(temp_counter + 3)` in `files_set` still holds true.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1`, `temp_counter + 3` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 3)` is in `files_set`.**
