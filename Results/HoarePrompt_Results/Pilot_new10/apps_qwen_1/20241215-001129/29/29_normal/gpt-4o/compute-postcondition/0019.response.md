Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of files, `files` is an empty list, `regulars` is a list containing the names of all files with type '0', `examples` is a list containing the names of all files with type '1'.** 

Explanation:
- The loop processes each file in the `files` list, splitting each file into `name` and `type_`.
- If `type_` is '1', the `name` is added to the `examples` list.
- If `type_` is '0', the `name` is added to the `regulars` list.
- After processing all files, the `files` list becomes empty because each file is processed and removed from the list.
- The `regulars` list contains all names of files with type '0'.
- The `examples` list contains all names of files with type '1'.

Since the loop processes all files and the `files` list is emptied in the process, the final state of the variables will be as described above.
