Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `regulars` contains at least one element.
   - `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.
   - `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 (implying it starts from 1).
   - If `regulars[i] != str(target)`, then `regulars[i]` is updated to `str(temp_counter + 1)`, and `moves` includes the appended string `f'move {str(temp_counter + 1)} {len(examples) + i + 1}'`.
   - `files_set` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(regulars))`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the current index being processed.
   - `target` is `len(examples) + i + 1`.
   - `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 for each iteration (starting from 1).

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the index `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - `target` should be updated to `len(examples) + (i + 1) + 1`.

Given this information, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `target` will be `len(examples) + (i + 1) + 1`.
- `temp_counter` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `temp_counter + 1`.

Since no other state variables (`regulars`, `moves`, `files_set`) are directly modified within the loop body based on the given information, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`regulars` contains at least one element, `target` is `len(examples) + (i + 1) + 1`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, `files_set` remains unchanged.**
