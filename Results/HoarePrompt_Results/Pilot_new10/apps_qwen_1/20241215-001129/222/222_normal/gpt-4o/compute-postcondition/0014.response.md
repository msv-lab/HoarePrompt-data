The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000.

Based on the given constraints, the function will return a specific value depending on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 1000 inclusive. The return value depends on the relationship between `n` and `k`.**
