Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Turning Skewers**: 
   - The program attempts to turn skewers in a sequence determined by the value `2 * k + 1`. This does not align with the requirement to turn \( k \) closest skewers from each side of the skewer being turned.
   - For example, if \( k = 1 \), turning skewer number 3 should turn skewers 1, 2, 3, and 4, but the current logic would turn skewers 1 and 5, which is incorrect.

2. **Number of Actions Required**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of actions needed to turn over all \( n \) skewers. The current logic does not provide a minimal solution. Instead, it generates a sequence of positions without ensuring the minimal number of actions.

3. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 1 \), the expected output is to turn skewers 2 and 5. However, the current program would generate a different sequence, leading to incorrect results.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to implement a strategy that ensures the minimum number of actions and correctly identifies the skewers to be turned based on the problem's requirements. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

# Function to find the minimum number of actions
def min_actions(n, k):
    # If k is 0, each action turns a single skewer, so n actions are needed
    if k == 0:
        return n
    # Otherwise, use the optimal strategy
    return (n + 2 * k) // (2 * k + 1)

# Calculate the minimum number of actions
min_steps = min_actions(n, k)

# Determine the skewers to be turned
skewers_to_turn = []
for i in range(1, n + 1, 2 * k + 1):
    skewers_to_turn.append(i)

# Print the result
print(min_steps)
print(' '.join(map(str, skewers_to_turn)))
```

This corrected program ensures that the skewers are turned in the minimal number of actions and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
