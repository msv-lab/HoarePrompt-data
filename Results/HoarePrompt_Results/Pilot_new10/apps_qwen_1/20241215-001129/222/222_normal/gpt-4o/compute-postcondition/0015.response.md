Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 1000 inclusive. It generates a list of integers starting from 1 and increases each subsequent integer by `2 * k + 1`. After generating the list, it prints the length of the list followed by the list elements separated by spaces.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
- The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`.
- The values of `n` and `k` are constrained as specified.
- The function creates a list of integers starting from 1, with each subsequent integer incremented by `2 * k + 1`.
- The function prints the length of the generated list followed by the list elements.
- All potential cases and constraints are considered based on the code.
