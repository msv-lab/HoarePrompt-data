According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop condition is `i <= n`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Right before the loop, we have the following states:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000
- `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000
- `positions` is an empty list
- `i` is 1

For the loop to execute at least one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, it is already less than or equal to `n` (as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1).

No other states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes at least one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
