Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 1000, `positions` is a list containing all integers starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1` until the last value is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is the final value of `i` which is `2 + 2 * k * (number_of_iterations) + (number_of_iterations - 1)`**
