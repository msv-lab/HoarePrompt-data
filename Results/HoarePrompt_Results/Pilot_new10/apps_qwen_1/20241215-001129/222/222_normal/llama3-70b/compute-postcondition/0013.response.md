The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but takes two integers `n` and `k` as input through `input().split()`. It then calculates the value of `l` using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and constructs a list `res` containing integers based on the value of `l`. Finally, it prints the value of `l` followed by the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

Given the code and annotations, the function behaves as follows:

- If `k` is 0, `l` will be 0, and `res` will be an empty list.
- If `k` is non-zero, `l` will be calculated based on the given formula, and `res` will contain a sequence of integers starting from 1 and increasing by `k * 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates `l` using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, and constructs a list `res` containing integers starting from 1 and increasing by `k * 2 + 1` for `l` times. It then prints the value of `l` followed by the elements of `res` separated by spaces.**
