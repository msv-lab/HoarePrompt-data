Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `l` and the construction of the list `res` do not accurately reflect the required logic to turn over all `n` skewers with the minimal number of actions.

For instance, consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, turning skewer number 3 would affect skewers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, to turn over all skewers, the minimum number of actions required should be 2 (turning skewers 2 and 4). However, the given code would incorrectly calculate `l` as 1, and the result would be printing only one skewer number, which is not sufficient to turn over all skewers.

A more accurate approach would involve a different strategy to determine the minimum number of actions and the specific skewers to turn. The current implementation fails to handle the necessary logic for all cases, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
