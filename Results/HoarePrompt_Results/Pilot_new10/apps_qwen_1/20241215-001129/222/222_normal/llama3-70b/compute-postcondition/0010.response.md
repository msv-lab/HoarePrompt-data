The code calculates the value of `l` using the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and then prints `l`. The list `res` is not printed, only `l` is printed. 

Let's analyze the impact on the variables:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `l` is updated based on the formula `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`.
- `res` is not affected and remains as per its initial calculation.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 1000\); `l` is \((n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)\); `res` is a list containing integers of the form `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(l-1\) if \(l > 0\). If \(l = 0\), `res` is an empty list. The value of `l` is printed.**
