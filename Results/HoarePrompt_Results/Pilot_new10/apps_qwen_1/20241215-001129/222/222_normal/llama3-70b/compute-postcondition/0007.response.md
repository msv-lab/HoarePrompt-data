According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 3
- `k` is at least 1
- `l` is greater than 0
- `res` is a list containing `(i + 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` and `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `l`. Therefore, `i_current` must be incremented by 1.

Given the conditions:
- `n` remains at least 3
- `k` remains at least 1
- `l` remains greater than 0
- `res` is updated to include the new values based on the new `i` value (which is `i_current + 1`)

Let's assume the current value of `i` was `i_current` before the last iteration, so now `i` is `i_current + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i_current + 1` must be less than `l`.

Therefore, we adjust the state as follows:
- `n` is still at least 3
- `k` is still at least 1
- `l` must remain greater than 0
- `res` is updated to include the new values based on the new `i` value (`i_current + 1`)

The exact value of `i_current` is not specified, but we know it is less than `l` before the last iteration. Let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i_current + 1`.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is at least 1, `l` must be greater than 0, `res` is a list containing `(i_new + 1) * (k * 2 + 1) + 1` and `i_new * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`**
