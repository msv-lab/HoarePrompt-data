The function `func` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parameter list. The output describes two cases based on the values of `n` and `k`, but since these variables are not passed to the function, they must be defined within the function's scope. However, based solely on the parameter constraints and the provided information about the output, we can infer the following:

Case_1: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000. If `k` is 0, the function returns a specific value (not detailed in the given output).
Case_2: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000. If `k` is not 0, the function returns a different specific value (not detailed in the given output).

Given this information, the functionality of the function `func` is to return a value based on the condition of the variable `k` without explicitly mentioning the values returned in each case.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on whether `k` is 0 or not, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000.**
