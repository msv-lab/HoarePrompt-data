Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for \( n \geq 3 \). The program calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) for \( n > 2 \), which is not related to the correct solution of counting permutations where \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \). The output hints confirm that the `func_1` function computes the factorial modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is not the intended solution for the given problem.
