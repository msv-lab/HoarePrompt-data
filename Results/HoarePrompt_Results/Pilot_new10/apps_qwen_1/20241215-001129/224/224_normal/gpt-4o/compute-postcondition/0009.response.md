The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `mod`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and `mod` is an integer equal to 1000000007. After executing the function body, the function returns `result`, which is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and an integer `mod`, and return the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`.
