The code updates the value of `result` by multiplying it with `i` and taking the modulo with `mod`. Initially, `result` is 1, `i` is 2, and `mod` is 1000000007. So, `result` becomes \(1 \times 2 \mod 1000000007 = 2\).

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 1, `mod` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `result` is 2, `i` is 2**
