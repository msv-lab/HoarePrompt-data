Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and `mod` (an integer equal to 1000000007). It calculates the factorial of `n` modulo `mod` by iterating from 2 to `n` and multiplying each number by the current result modulo `mod`. The function returns the final result, which is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`.**
