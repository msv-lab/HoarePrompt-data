You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a function $f(p)$ on a permutation $p$ as follows. Let $g_i$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_i$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $i$). Then $f(p)$ is the number of distinct elements among $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_n$.

Let $f_{max}(n)$ be the maximum value of $f(p)$ among all permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$.

Given an integers $n$, count the number of permutations $p$ of integers $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, such that $f(p)$ is equal to $f_{max}(n)$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$.


-----Input-----

The only line contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$) — the length of the permutations.

The only line should contain your answer modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Note-----

Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length $3$:  $[1,2,3]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[1,3,2]$, $f(p)=1$.  $[2,1,3]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[2,3,1]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,1,2]$, $f(p)=2$.  $[3,2,1]$, $f(p)=2$. 

The maximum value $f_{max}(3) = 2$, and there are $4$ permutations $p$ such that $f(p)=2$.
Program:
```
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(input())
if n == 2:
    result = 1
else:
    result = func_1(n - 1, MOD)
print(result)

def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the program only handles the case when \( n = 2 \) correctly and uses a simple factorial calculation for other values of \( n \), which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

The problem requires counting the number of permutations \( p \) of integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) such that \( f(p) = f_{max}(n) \). For \( n \geq 3 \), the maximum value of \( f(p) \) is \( \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil \). However, the provided program calculates the factorial of \( n-1 \) for \( n > 2 \), which is not related to the correct solution.

For example, consider \( n = 3 \):

- The maximum value of \( f(p) \) is 2.
- There are 4 permutations of length 3: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
- Out of these, the permutations [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1] have \( f(p) = 2 \).

The correct output for \( n = 3 \) should be 4, but the program outputs the factorial of 2, which is 2, indicating that the program is incorrect for this and other values of \( n \).

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(input())
if n == 2:
    result = 1
else:
    result = func_1(n - 1, MOD)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, and mod is the integer 1000000007.
def func_1(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = result * i % mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is 1, `mod` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `result` is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`, `i` is `n` + 1
    return result
    #The program returns result, which is the factorial of n modulo mod
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)) and `mod` (an integer equal to 1000000007). It calculates the factorial of `n` modulo `mod` by iterating from 2 to `n` and multiplying each number by the current result modulo `mod`. The function returns the final result, which is the factorial of `n` modulo `mod`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
