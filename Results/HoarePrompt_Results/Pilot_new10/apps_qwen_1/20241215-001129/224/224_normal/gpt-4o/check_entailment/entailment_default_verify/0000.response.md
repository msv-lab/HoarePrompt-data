Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not implement the required functionality. The function `func_1` calculates the factorial of `n-1` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not relevant to the problem description. The problem requires counting the number of permutations where the function \(f(p)\) reaches its maximum value \(f_{max}(n)\). The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` only calculates factorials, which does not solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is valid.
