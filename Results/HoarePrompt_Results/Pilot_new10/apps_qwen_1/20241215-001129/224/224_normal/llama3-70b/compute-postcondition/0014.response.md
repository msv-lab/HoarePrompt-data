To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `n + 1`.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
- `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.

### Loop Execution:
The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented, so it was `n` before the last iteration.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented from `n` to `n + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- The value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
- The other variables (`f_max_n`, `MOD`, and `dp`) remain unchanged because the loop body does not alter these variables.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, `i` is `n + 1`**.
