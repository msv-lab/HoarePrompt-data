Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length \(n\).
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0.
   - `dp[0] = 1`.
   - `j` is `f_max_n`.
   - `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] % 10`.

2. **Understand the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `f_max_n` down to 1.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it updates the `dp` list.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating in reverse, `j` will decrease by 1 at each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `f_max_n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `n` remains the same because the loop does not change the value of `n`.
   - `f_max_n` remains the same because the loop does not change the value of `f_max_n`.
   - `MOD` remains 10 because the loop does not change this value.
   - `dp` is updated in the loop, but its exact state depends on the loop body, which is not provided. However, the main update is `dp[f_max_n]` which is set to `dp[f_max_n] % 10`. This update happens only once when `j` is `f_max_n`.

Given the above analysis, the key state that needs adjustment is `j`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length \(n\), `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0, `dp[0] = 1`, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`, `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to `dp[f_max_n] % 10`**
