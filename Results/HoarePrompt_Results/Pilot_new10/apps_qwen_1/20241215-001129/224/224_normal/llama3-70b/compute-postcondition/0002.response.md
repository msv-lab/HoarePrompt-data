The code initializes the first element of the `dp` list to 1. This means that `dp[0]` is now set to 1, while the rest of the list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0, and `dp[0] = 1`.**
