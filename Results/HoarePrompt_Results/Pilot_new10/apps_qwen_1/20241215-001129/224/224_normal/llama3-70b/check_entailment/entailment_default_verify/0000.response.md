Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the program's implementation of `func_2` does not accurately calculate `f_max_n`. The `func_2` function calculates the GCD of the sequence from 1 to n, which does not align with the problem's requirement to find the maximum number of distinct GCD values among all permutations of length n. Additionally, the `func_3` function does not correctly handle the permutation logic to ensure that the GCD values are distinct for each prefix. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
