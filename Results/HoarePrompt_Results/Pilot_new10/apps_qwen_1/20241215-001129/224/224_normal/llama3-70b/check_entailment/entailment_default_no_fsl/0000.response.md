Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the required functions as described in the problem description.
- `func_1` correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
- `func_2` correctly calculates the maximum value of `f(p)` for permutations of length `n`, which is stored in `f_max_n`.
- `func_3` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of permutations of length `n` that achieve this maximum value of `f(p)`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the code handles all parts of the problem as specified and no counterexamples were found, the code is correct.
