Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \)
- \( f_{\text{max}_n} \) is a positive integer
- \( \text{MOD} = 10 \)
- \( \text{dp} \) is a list of length \( f_{\text{max}_n} + 1 \) where \( \text{dp}[0] = 1 \) and for every \( j \) from 1 to \( f_{\text{max}_n} \), \( \text{dp}[j] = (2 \times \text{dp}[j - 1] + \text{dp}[j - 2] + \ldots + \text{dp}[0]) \% 10 \)
- \( i = n + 1 \)
- \( j = f_{\text{max}_n} \)
- \( \text{dp}[j] = (2 \times \text{dp}[j - 1] + \text{dp}[j - 2] + \ldots + \text{dp}[0]) \% 10 \)

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over \( j \) in reverse order, starting from \( f_{\text{max}_n} \) down to 1:
```python
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis of Loop Execution:
- The loop condition checks if \( j \) is greater than 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, \( j = f_{\text{max}_n} \).

### Adjusting States:
For the loop to execute one more time, \( j \) needs to be decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0. Therefore:
- \( j \) should be \( f_{\text{max}_n} - 1 \).

### Updated States:
- \( n \) remains unchanged since it does not affect the loop condition.
- \( f_{\text{max}_n} \) remains unchanged since it does not affect the loop condition.
- \( \text{MOD} \) remains unchanged since it does not affect the loop condition.
- \( \text{dp} \) remains unchanged since it does not directly influence the loop condition.
- \( i \) remains unchanged since it does not affect the loop condition.
- \( j \) is now \( f_{\text{max}_n} - 1 \).

### Final Answer:
State: **\( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \), \( f_{\text{max}_n} \) is a positive integer, \( \text{MOD} = 10 \), \( \text{dp} \) is a list of length \( f_{\text{max}_n} + 1 \) where \( \text{dp}[0] = 1 \) and for every \( j \) from 1 to \( f_{\text{max}_n} \), \( \text{dp}[j] = (2 \times \text{dp}[j - 1] + \text{dp}[j - 2] + \ldots + \text{dp}[0]) \% 10 \), \( i = n + 1 \), \( j = f_{\text{max}_n} - 1 \)**
