Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\).
   - `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
   - `MOD` is 10.
   - `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`.
   - For every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `dp[j]` is updated to `(2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, meaning the loop has already run from `1` to `n + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 2`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n + 1`, the loop has completed its iterations up to `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - All other states remain unchanged as there is no indication that these states are dependent on the loop variable `i`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `f_max_n` remains the same.
   - `MOD` remains 10.
   - `dp` remains the same.
   - `i` is now `n + 2`.
   - `j` remains 1 (since `j` is not affected by the loop).

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is 1**
