The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This value is used for modulus operations in the program, but it does not affect the values of the existing variables `n` and `f_max_n`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the constant `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and f_max_n is an integer representing the maximum value of f(p) for permutations of length n; MOD is 10 ** 9 + 7**
