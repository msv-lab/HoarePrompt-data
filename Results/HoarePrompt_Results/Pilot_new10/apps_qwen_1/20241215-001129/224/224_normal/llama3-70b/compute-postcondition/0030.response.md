The code `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments `dp[j]` by `dp[j - 1]`. Given the initial conditions:
- `dp[j]` is initially 4.
- `dp[j - 1]` is the value of `dp[0]`, which is 1.

So, `dp[j]` becomes `4 + 1 = 5`.

All other variables (`n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `dp`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`; `i` is `n + 2`; `j` is 0; `dp[j]` is 5.**
