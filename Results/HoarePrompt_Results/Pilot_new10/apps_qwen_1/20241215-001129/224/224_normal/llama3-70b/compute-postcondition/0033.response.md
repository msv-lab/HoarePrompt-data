The code snippet `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` increments the value of `dp[j]` by `dp[j - 1]`. From the initial state, we know that `dp[j]` is initially 5. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `dp[j]` will be `5 + dp[j - 1]`.

Given that `dp[j]` was 5 before the operation, and assuming `dp[j - 1]` follows the pattern defined in the initial state, we need to determine its value. From the initial state, for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`. Since `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 4`, we can infer the following:

- For `j = 2`, `dp[2] = (2 * dp[1] + dp[0]) % 10 = (2 * 4 + 1) % 10 = 9 % 10 = 9`.
- For `j = 3`, `dp[3] = (2 * dp[2] + dp[1] + dp[0]) % 10 = (2 * 9 + 4 + 1) % 10 = 23 % 10 = 3`.
- For `j = 4`, `dp[4] = (2 * dp[3] + dp[2] + dp[1] + dp[0]) % 10 = (2 * 3 + 9 + 4 + 1) % 10 = 18 % 10 = 8`.
- For `j = 5`, `dp[5] = (2 * dp[4] + dp[3] + dp[2] + dp[1] + dp[0]) % 10 = (2 * 8 + 3 + 9 + 4 + 1) % 10 = 33 % 10 = 3`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `j`, we assume the last known value of `dp[j - 1]` before the operation, which is `3` based on the pattern described. Therefore, `dp[j]` becomes `5 + 3 = 8`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is 0, `dp[j]` is 8**
