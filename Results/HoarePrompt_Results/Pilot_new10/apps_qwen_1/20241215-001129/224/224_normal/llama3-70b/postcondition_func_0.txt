The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the function, the function returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and sets `b` to 0.
