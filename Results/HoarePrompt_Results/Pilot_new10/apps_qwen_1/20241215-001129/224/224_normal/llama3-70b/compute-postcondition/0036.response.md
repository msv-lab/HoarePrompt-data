Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (j + 1) * dp[j - 1] % 10`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `dp[j]` is the final value of `dp[f_max_n]` after the loop completes.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: Initially, `dp[0] = 1` and for each iteration, `dp[j]` is updated using the formula `dp[j] += dp[j - 1]` followed by `dp[j] %= MOD`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `n`.
   - For each `i` from `1` to `n`, the inner loop runs from `f_max_n` down to `1`.
   - Inside the inner loop, `dp[j]` is updated by adding `dp[j - 1]` and taking modulo `10`.

3. **Effect of the Inner Loop**:
   - After the first iteration of the outer loop (`i = 1`), `dp[j]` for each `j` is computed as `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.
   - With each subsequent iteration of the outer loop, `dp[j]` for each `j` gets updated to the sum of previous values of `dp[j - 1]`, `dp[j - 2]`, ..., `dp[0]` modulo `10`.

4. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations of the loop, `dp[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `f_max_n` is the cumulative sum of all previous `dp[k]` values for `k < j` modulo `10`.
   - Specifically, the value of `dp[j]` after all iterations is equivalent to `(j + 1) * dp[j - 1] % 10` because each `dp[j]` accumulates the sum of all previous `dp[k]` values up to `dp[0]`.

5. **Final Values**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1` because the outer loop runs `n` times.
   - `j` will be `0` because the inner loop finishes when `j` reaches `0`.
   - `dp[j]` (when `j = 0`) will be the final value of `dp[f_max_n]` after all iterations.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes all iterations is as described above.
