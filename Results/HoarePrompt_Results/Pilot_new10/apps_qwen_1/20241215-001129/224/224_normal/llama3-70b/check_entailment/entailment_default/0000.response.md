Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. This is used correctly in the subsequent functions.

2. **Function `func_2`**: Computes the maximum value of \( f(p) \) for all permutations of length \( n \). This is done by iterating through all integers from 1 to \( n \) and updating the result using the GCD function. The output hints confirm this behavior, and the code aligns with the problem description.

3. **Function `func_3`**: Uses dynamic programming to compute the number of permutations \( p \) such that \( f(p) \) equals \( f_{max}(n) \). The dynamic programming approach ensures that the result is computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), as required. The output hints confirm that this function correctly updates the DP table to represent the cumulative product of possible values.

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
