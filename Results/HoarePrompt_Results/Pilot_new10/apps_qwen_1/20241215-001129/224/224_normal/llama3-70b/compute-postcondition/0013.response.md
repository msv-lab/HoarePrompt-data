Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):
    dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
    dp[j] %= MOD
```

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length \(n\)
- `MOD` is 10
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` initialized to 0
- `dp[0] = 1`

### Analysis of the Loop

#### After the First Iteration (j = f_max_n)
- `j` is set to `f_max_n`
- `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to `(dp[f_max_n - 1] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % 10` which simplifies to `2 * dp[f_max_n - 1] % 10`

#### After the Second Iteration (j = f_max_n - 1)
- `j` is set to `f_max_n - 1`
- `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is updated to `(dp[f_max_n - 2] + dp[f_max_n - 1]) % 10`

#### After the Third Iteration (j = f_max_n - 2)
- `j` is set to `f_max_n - 2`
- `dp[f_max_n - 2]` is updated to `(dp[f_max_n - 3] + dp[f_max_n - 2]) % 10 + dp[f_max_n - 2] % 10`

From these iterations, we can observe that each iteration updates `dp[j]` based on the previous values in the list, reducing the index `j` by 1 each time.

### General Pattern
Each iteration updates `dp[j]` to the sum of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - 1]` modulo `MOD`. This continues until `j` reaches 0.

### Final State
- The loop runs from `j = f_max_n` down to `j = 1`.
- For `j = 0`, `dp[0]` remains unchanged and equals `1`.
- For `j > 0`, `dp[j]` will be the cumulative sum of all `dp[k]` for `k < j` modulo `MOD`.

### Conclusion
After the loop completes, the final state of the variables is:
- `n` remains the same: an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- `f_max_n` remains the same: an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length \(n\)
- `MOD` remains the same: 10
- `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and each subsequent element `dp[j]` (for \(1 \leq j \leq f_max_n\)) is the cumulative sum of all previous elements in the list modulo `MOD`.

### Output State
**Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\), `f_max_n` is an integer representing the maximum value of \(f(p)\) for permutations of length `n`, `MOD` is 10, `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` and for every `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`.**
