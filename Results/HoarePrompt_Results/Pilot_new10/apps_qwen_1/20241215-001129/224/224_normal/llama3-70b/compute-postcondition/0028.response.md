The code snippet updates `dp[j]` by taking its modulo with `MOD`. Initially, `dp[j]` is `dp[1] = 4`. Since `MOD` is 10, `dp[j] % MOD` will simply be 4 because 4 is already less than 10.

So, the value of `dp[j]` remains unchanged at 4 after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `f_max_n` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `MOD` is 10; `dp` is a list of length `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 4`, and for every `j` from 2 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j] = (2 * dp[j - 1] + dp[j - 2] + ... + dp[0]) % 10`; `i` is `n + 2`; `j` is 1; `dp[j]` is 4**
