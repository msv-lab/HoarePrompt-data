The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` are defined within the function's scope but are not passed as arguments when calling the function. The function constraints are: `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even. `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m. Based on these constraints, the function will process these internal parameters and produce some output. However, since the exact output is not specified in the given information, we cannot detail what the function returns without additional information.

Functionality: **The function accepts internal parameters n, m, and k where n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m, and returns an unspecified output based on these parameters.**
