Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle the movement pattern of Lara in the snake fashion accurately beyond the first few steps.

Let's break down the problem and the given solution:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - Lara starts at cell (1, 1) and moves down to (n, 1).
   - Then she moves rightwards in a snake fashion: (n, 2), (n-1, 2), (n-2, 2), ..., (1, 2).

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution calculates `k % (n * 2 - 2)` to reduce `k` to a manageable range.
   - It then uses a series of if-else conditions to determine the final position based on the reduced value of `k`.

However, the solution does not accurately simulate the snake-like movement pattern after the initial downward movement. Here’s why the solution is incorrect:

- When `k < n - 1`, the solution correctly prints the cell after the downward movement. This part is fine.
- For `k >= n - 1`, the logic does not correctly simulate the snake-like movement. The solution incorrectly handles the transition from the downward movement to the snake-like movement.

To correctly simulate the snake-like movement, we need to keep track of the current position and direction (right or left) and adjust the position accordingly. The given solution fails to do this properly.

### Correct Implementation:

Here’s a corrected version of the function that correctly simulates Lara's movement:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # First, move down to (n, 1)
    k -= n - 1
    
    # Now k is the number of steps in the snake-like movement
    if k == 0:
        print(1, 1)
    elif k < n - 1:
        print(n - k, 2)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        col = 2
        while k > 0:
            if k % 2 == 0:
                col -= 1
                if col == 1:
                    col = 2
            else:
                col += 1
                if col == 2:
                    col = 1
            k -= 1
        print(n, col)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Implementation:
- Move down from (1, 1) to (n, 1) using `k -= n - 1`.
- After reaching (n, 1), calculate the remaining steps `k` in the snake-like movement.
- Simulate the snake-like movement by adjusting the column and decrementing `k` until `k` reaches zero.

This implementation correctly simulates the snake-like movement pattern as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
