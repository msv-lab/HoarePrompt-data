The code `print(k + 1, 1)` prints the value of `k + 1` followed by `1`. The value of `k + 1` is an integer and the value of `1` is also an integer. However, no new variables are defined, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only changes are in the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n * 2 - 2\) and `n` is even, and the current value of `k` is less than `n - 1`; printed output is `k + 1` followed by `1`.**
