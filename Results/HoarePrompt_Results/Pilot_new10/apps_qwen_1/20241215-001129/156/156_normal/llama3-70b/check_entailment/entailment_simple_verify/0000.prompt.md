You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines Lara's position based on the given number of moves \( k \). Let's break down how the program works:

1. The total number of moves \( k \) is first reduced modulo \( n \times 2 - 2 \). This accounts for the repeating pattern of Lara's movement through the dungeon.

2. If \( k < n - 1 \), it means Lara is still in the downward movement phase from cell (1,1) to cell (n,1). The program calculates the exact row and column by adding 1 to \( k \) and keeping the column as 1.

3. If \( k \geq n - 1 \), it means Lara has completed the downward movement and started the snake-like movement. The program calculates the row and column based on the remaining moves after subtracting \( n - 1 \) (which covers the downward movement).

The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints and correctly determines Lara's position for any valid \( k \). Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9 and n is always even. k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n * 2 - 2\) and `n` is even. If \(k < n * 2 - 2\), the function prints `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. If \(k \geq n - 1\), the function does not print anything.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers. If `k < n - 1`, the function prints `k + 1` followed by `1`. If `k >= n - 1`, the function prints `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1`. In both cases, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
