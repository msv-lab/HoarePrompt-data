`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the `input().split()` method, which converts the input into integers. The initial conditions are that `n` and `m` are integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and `n` is always even, and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\). After executing the code, these conditions are met for the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\), and `n` is even**
