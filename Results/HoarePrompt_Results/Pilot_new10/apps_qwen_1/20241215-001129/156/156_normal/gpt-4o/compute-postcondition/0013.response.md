The code `print(row, col)` simply prints the values of `row` and `col`. No variables are modified by this statement, only their values are used in the print function. Therefore, the values of `row` and `col` remain unchanged after executing the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an even positive integer between 2 and \(10^9\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\) and \(k \geq 0\) after decrementing by `n - 1`, `full_rows` is `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` is `k % (m - 1)`, `row` is either `n - full_rows` or depends on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, and `col` is either `2 + (k % (m - 1))` if `full_rows` is even or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd.**
