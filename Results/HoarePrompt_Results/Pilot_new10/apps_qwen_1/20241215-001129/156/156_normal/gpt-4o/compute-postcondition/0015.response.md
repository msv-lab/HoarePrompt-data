The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that `n` is even and `2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9`.
- `k` is an integer such that `0 ≤ k < n·m`.

The function does not specify a particular return value based on the given constraints alone. Therefore, we need to consider the typical behavior of such functions, which often involve calculating or determining something based on the input parameters.

Given the constraints, a common scenario is to return an index or a value derived from the parameters within the specified range. However, without additional details on the exact operation, we can only state the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an even positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), and `k` (an integer).**
