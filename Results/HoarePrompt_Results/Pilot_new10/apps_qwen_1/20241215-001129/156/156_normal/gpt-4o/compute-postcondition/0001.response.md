The code `print(k + 1, 1)` increments the value of `k` by 1 and prints the result along with the number 1. Since `k` is an integer such that `0 ≤ k < n·m` and the current value of `k` is less than `n - 1`, the new value of `k` will be `k + 1`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The output state is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer such that 2 ≤ n, `m` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k < n·m and the current value of `k` is less than `n - 1`; `k` is now `k + 1`**
