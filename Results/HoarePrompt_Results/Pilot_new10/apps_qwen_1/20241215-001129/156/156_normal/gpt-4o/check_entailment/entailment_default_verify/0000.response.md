Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The output hints accurately summarize the functionality of the `func_1` function. The program handles all specified cases correctly, including the initial downward movement and the subsequent snake-like pattern movement. The logic for determining the row and column based on the value of `k` is implemented correctly, and the program produces the expected outputs for the given examples. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
