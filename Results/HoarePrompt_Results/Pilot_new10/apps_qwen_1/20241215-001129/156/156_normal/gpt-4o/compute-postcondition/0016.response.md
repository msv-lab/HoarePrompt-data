Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an even positive integer between 2 and \(10^9\)), `m` (a positive integer such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^9\)), and `k` (an integer such that \(0 \leq k < n \cdot m\)). It prints the coordinates `(row, col)` based on the given values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. If `k < n - 1`, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. Otherwise, it adjusts `k` by subtracting `n - 1`, calculates `full_rows` and `remaining_steps`, and determines the row and column based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd. Specifically, if `full_rows` is even, the row is `n - full_rows` and the column is `2 + remaining_steps`; if `full_rows` is odd, the row is `n - full_rows` and the column is `m - remaining_steps`.**
