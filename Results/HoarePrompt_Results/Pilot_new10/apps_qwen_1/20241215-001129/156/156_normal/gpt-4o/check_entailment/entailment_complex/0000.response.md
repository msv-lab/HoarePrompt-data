Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `k < n - 1`. If true, it prints `(k + 1, 1)`. This correctly handles the scenario where Lara hasn't completed her initial downward movement from `(1, 1)` to `(n, 1)`.

2. **Adjustment of k**: If `k >= n - 1`, the program subtracts `n - 1` from `k`. This accounts for the fact that after reaching the bottom-left corner `(n, 1)`, Lara starts her snake-like movement.

3. **Calculation of full_rows and remaining_steps**: 
   - `full_rows = k // (m - 1)` calculates how many full cycles of `(m - 1)` steps she has taken in the snake-like pattern.
   - `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)` gives the number of steps left in the current cycle.

4. **Determining Row and Column**:
   - If `full_rows` is even, the row is `n - full_rows` because she is moving to the right and then up.
   - If `full_rows` is odd, the row is again `n - full_rows` but the column calculation differs based on the direction of movement.
   - The column is calculated as `2 + remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is even, indicating a rightward movement, or `m - remaining_steps` if `full_rows` is odd, indicating an upward movement followed by a leftward movement.

5. **Handling Boundary Conditions**: The problem ensures that `n` is even and within the specified range, and `k` is within the valid range `[0, n*m)`. Therefore, the logic handles these constraints properly.

Since the program accurately implements the described logic for all possible values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, it is correct according to the problem description.
