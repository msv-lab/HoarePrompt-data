Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m` is greater than the maximum possible value that can be represented by the range of `n` for which `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. Specifically, the program uses a binary search to find the range of `n` values, but it does not correctly handle the case where no such `n` exists.

For example, consider the input `m = 5`. According to the problem statement, there should be no valid `n` because the smallest `n` whose factorial has 5 trailing zeroes is 25, and the program should return `0`. However, the current implementation will still perform the binary search and may incorrectly return an empty list or other results.

To fix this, the program should check if the upper bound (`high`) is large enough to contain a valid `n` before performing the binary search. If not, it should return `0` immediately. Here's a modified version of the `func_2` function to address this issue:

```python
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    if func_1(high) < m:
        return []
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result
```

With this modification, the program correctly handles cases where no valid `n` exists.
