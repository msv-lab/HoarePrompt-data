The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement here simply indicates that we would exit the nearest loop or switch if one existed. However, since none exists, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` is 0, `n` is 1**
