Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `n` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `while True:`. This means the loop will always execute as long as the loop body does not explicitly terminate the loop (e.g., using `break`).

3. **Objective**:
   - We need to adjust the program state so that the loop can execute at least once. Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least once regardless of the values of `m`, `count`, and `n`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we don't need to consider its contents because the loop will always execute once due to the `while True` condition.

Given that the loop will always execute at least once, no adjustments are necessary in the program state to allow the loop to execute one more time.

**Answer**:
State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` is 0, `n` is 1**
