The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional statement, but in this case, there is no loop or conditional statement present that would be affected by the `break` statement. Therefore, the variables `m`, `count`, and `n` retain their initial values. The `break` statement does not change the values of these variables.

Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `count` is 0, `n` is 1**
