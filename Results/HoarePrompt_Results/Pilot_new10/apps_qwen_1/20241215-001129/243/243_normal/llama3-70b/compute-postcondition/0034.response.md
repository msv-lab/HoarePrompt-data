The value of `n` is incremented by 1, changing its value from the initial state. The value of `count` remains unchanged, and the value of `m` also remains unchanged. The list `ans` still contains `[n]`, but since `n` has been incremented, `ans` now contains `[n+1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and is equal to its initial value plus 1, `count` is a non-negative integer, `m` is an integer, and `ans` is a list containing `[n+1]`**
