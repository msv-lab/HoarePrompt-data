Precondition: `n` is an integer, `count` is a non-negative integer, and `m` is an integer.
Program Fragment:
```python
if n // 5 ** count < m:
```
If part: `n` is an integer, `count` is a non-negative integer, `m` is an integer, and `n // 5 ** count < m`.
Else part: None

Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `count` is a non-negative integer, and `m` is an integer. If `n // 5 ** count < m`, no changes are made. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.***
