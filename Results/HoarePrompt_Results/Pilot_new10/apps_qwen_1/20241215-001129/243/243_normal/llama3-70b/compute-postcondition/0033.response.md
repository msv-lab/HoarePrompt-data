`ans.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `ans`, it is assumed to be an empty list. After executing this line of code, the value of `n` is added to `ans`. The values of `count` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `count` is a non-negative integer, `m` is an integer, and `ans` is a list containing `[n]`**
