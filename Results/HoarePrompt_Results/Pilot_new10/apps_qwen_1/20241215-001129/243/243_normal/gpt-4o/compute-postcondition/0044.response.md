Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - \( m \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq 100,000 \).
   - `low` must be less than `high`.
   - `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 2\).
   - `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(left)` and must be equal to `m`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the loop can execute one more time.

### Analysis:

- **`m`:** This value remains constant throughout the loop and does not change. Therefore, no adjustment is needed here.
  
- **`low` and `high`:** These values must satisfy the condition `low < high`. The loop can continue as long as this condition holds true.

- **`left`:** This is defined as \((low + high) // 2 - 2\). Since `left` is derived from `low` and `high`, we need to ensure that `low` and `high` can still form a valid `left` value in the next iteration.

- **`zeroes`:** This is set to the result of `func_1(left)` and must be equal to `m`. For the loop to continue, `func_1(left)` must return a value that is equal to `m`.

- **`result`:** This is an empty list and does not affect the loop condition.

- **`high` and `right`:** These values remain unchanged after the last iteration, and their values do not directly impact the loop continuation unless `low` is adjusted accordingly.

### Determining the Necessary Adjustments:

For the loop to execute one more time, `low` and `high` must maintain the condition `low < high`. Additionally, `func_1(left)` must return a value equal to `m` when called with the updated `left` value.

Given the current state, `left` is already calculated as \((low + high) // 2 - 2\). For the loop to continue, `low` and `high` need to be adjusted such that the condition `low < high` is maintained and `func_1(left)` returns a value equal to `m`.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `low` and `high` remain such that `low < high` and `func_1(left)` returns a value equal to `m`.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` must be less than `high`, `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(left)` and must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `high` and `right` must be such that the condition `low < high` is satisfied after the next iteration.**
