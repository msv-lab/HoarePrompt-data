`result` is assigned the value of a list generated by the `range` function, starting from `left + 1` and ending at `right - 1`. The variables `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and `func_1(right - 1)` equals `m` while `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`. 

Output State: **`right` is the smallest integer greater than \((low + high) // 2 + 1\) such that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, and `func_1(right - 1)` must equal `m`; `result` is a list ranging from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
