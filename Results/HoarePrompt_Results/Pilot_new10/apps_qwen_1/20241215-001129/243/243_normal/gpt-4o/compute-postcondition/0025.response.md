The value of `right` is initially calculated as \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 2\). After the line `right += 1` is executed, `right` is incremented by 1. The value of `m` remains unchanged because it was not affected by the operation.

Therefore, the updated value of `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 3\).

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + 3\)**
