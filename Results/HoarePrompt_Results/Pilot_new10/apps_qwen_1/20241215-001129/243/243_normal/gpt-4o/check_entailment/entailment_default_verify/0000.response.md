Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment suggested that the program does not handle the case where `m` is greater than the maximum possible value that can be represented by the range of `n` for which `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. However, after reviewing the code and the provided output hints, it appears that the program has been modified to handle this case correctly. The revised `func_2` function checks if the upper bound (`high`) is large enough to contain a valid `n` before performing the binary search. If not, it returns an empty list immediately, which aligns with the expected behavior for inputs where no such `n` exists. Therefore, the program is now correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
