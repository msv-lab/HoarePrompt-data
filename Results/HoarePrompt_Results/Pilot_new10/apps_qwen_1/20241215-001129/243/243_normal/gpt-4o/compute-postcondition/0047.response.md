The code updates the value of `right` to `mid + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `mid` is equal to `left`, which is \((low + high) // 2 - k\). Therefore, `right` is updated to \((low + high) // 2 - k + 1\).

The states of the other variables remain unchanged: `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` must be less than `high`, `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\), `zeroes` is equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` must be less than `high`; `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\); `zeroes` is equal to `m`; `result` is an empty list; `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration; `right` is \((low + high) // 2 - k + 1\)**
