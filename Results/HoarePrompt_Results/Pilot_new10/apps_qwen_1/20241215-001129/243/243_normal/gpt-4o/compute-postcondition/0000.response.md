The given code snippet is a comment block and does not contain any executable statements that would modify the state of the program. The only variable mentioned in the initial state is `m`, which is an integer such that `1 <= m <= 100,000`.

Since no executable code is provided, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000.**
