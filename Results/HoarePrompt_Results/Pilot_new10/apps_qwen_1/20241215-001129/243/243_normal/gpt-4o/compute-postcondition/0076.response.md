To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is that `right` has been increased by 1.
- The loop condition is `while func_1(right) == m:`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `right` has been incremented by 1.
3. **Requirement for Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m` in the next iteration. This means that the function `func_1` should return `m` when evaluated with the new value of `right`.

### Conclusion:
Since `right` has just been incremented, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `func_1(right)` still equals `m` in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that the condition `func_1(right) == m` holds true after `right` is incremented.

### State Adjustment:
- We need to ensure that `func_1(right)` is still equal to `m` in the next iteration.
- This means that the value of `right` after being incremented must satisfy the condition `func_1(right) == m`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`right` must be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`**
