To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop statement.

Given:
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` must be less than `high`.
- `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\).
- `zeroes` is equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration.
- `right` is \((low + high) // 2 - k + 1\).

The `while` loop statement is:
```
while func_1(right) == m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(right) == m` must be true. We need to ensure that this condition holds true after modifying the program state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `m` is an integer within the specified range.
   - `low` is less than `high`.
   - `left` is calculated as \((low + high) // 2 - k\).
   - `zeroes` is equal to `m`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `high` and `right` remain unchanged from the last iteration.
   - `right` is \((low + high) // 2 - k + 1\).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(right) == m`.

3. **Ensuring the Condition Holds**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`.

Given that `m` is already defined and remains unchanged, and `right` is updated based on `low` and `high`, we need to ensure that the current `right` value satisfies the condition `func_1(right) == m`.

### Conclusion:

Since `m` is fixed and the only dynamic variable in the loop condition is `right`, and we know that `right` is derived from `low` and `high`, we do not need to change any other states. The current state of `right` should satisfy the condition for the loop to continue.

Thus, no additional adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time based on the given information.

**State:**
**`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` must be less than `high`; `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - k\); `zeroes` is equal to `m`; `result` is an empty list; `high` and `right` remain as they are after the last iteration; `right` is \((low + high) // 2 - k + 1\)**
