The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is previously defined as \((low + high) // 2\). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` must be less than `high`; `mid` is updated to \((low + high) // 2\); `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; `high` is now `mid - 1`; all other variables (`result`, `left`, `right`) remain as they are after the last iteration.**
