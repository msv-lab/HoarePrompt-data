The value of `right` is incremented by 1, and the function `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`. After executing `right += 1`, the value of `right` changes, but the condition that `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1; `func_1(right)` must be equal to `m`**
