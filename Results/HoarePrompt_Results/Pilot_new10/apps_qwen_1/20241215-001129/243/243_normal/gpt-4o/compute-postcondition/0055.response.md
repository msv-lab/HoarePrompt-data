The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` creates a list of integers starting from `left + 1` up to, but not including, `right`. This means the `result` variable is now assigned this new list.

Given the initial state:
- `right` is incremented to a value where `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`
- `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`
- `low` remains as it was before the loop started
- `high` remains as it was before the loop started
- `left` remains as it was before the loop started
- `zeroes` remains as it was before the loop started
- `result` remains as it was before the loop started

After executing the code, the `result` variable is updated to the new list generated by `range(left + 1, right)`.

Output State: **`right` is incremented to a value where `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, `low` remains as it was before the loop started, `high` remains as it was before the loop started, `left` remains as it was before the loop started, `zeroes` remains as it was before the loop started, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`**
