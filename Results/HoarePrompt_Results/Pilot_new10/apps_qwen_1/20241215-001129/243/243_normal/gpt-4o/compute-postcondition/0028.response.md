Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` is 0; `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\); `result` is an empty list; `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\); `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)'; `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\); `right` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + (number of loop executions - 1)\)**

Explanation:
- The loop condition `func_1(right) == m` checks if the function `func_1` evaluated at `right` equals `m`.
- Each iteration of the loop increments `right` by 1.
- After each execution of the loop, `right` increases by 1, starting from \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\) (initial value of `mid`).
- After \(n\) iterations, `right` will be \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + n\).

Since the loop continues until `func_1(right) != m`, and based on the given outputs, the loop will eventually terminate when `func_1(right)` no longer equals `m`. The final value of `right` will be \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 + (number of loop executions - 1)\), indicating that the loop has incremented `right` exactly `number of loop executions` times.

All other variables (`low`, `high`, `result`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `left`) do not change within the loop and retain their initial values.
