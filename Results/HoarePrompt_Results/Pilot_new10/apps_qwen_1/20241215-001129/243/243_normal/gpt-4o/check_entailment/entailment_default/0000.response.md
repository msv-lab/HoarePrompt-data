Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where `m` is very large and the range of `n` values that satisfy the condition exceeds the constraints of the problem. Specifically, the code uses a binary search to find the range of `n` values, but it does not properly handle the boundary conditions and the range of values that `n` can take.

For example, consider the case where `m = 100,000`. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`, but the binary search in `func_2` might not find the correct range of `n` values due to the large range and the way the bounds are updated. The code might fail to find all possible values of `n` that satisfy the condition, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that it correctly handles the binary search and finds all valid `n` values within the given constraints.
