`left` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 2\). Since the code only changes the value of `left`, the other variables (`m`, `low`, `high`, and the condition `func_1(left) == m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration, `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 3\), and `func_1(left) == m`**
