The code assigns the value `0` to `low` and the value `5 * (m + 1)` to `high`. The initial value of `m` is an integer between 1 and 100,000. After executing the code, the value of `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `low` and `high` are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000; `low` is 0; `high` is 5 * (m + 1)**
