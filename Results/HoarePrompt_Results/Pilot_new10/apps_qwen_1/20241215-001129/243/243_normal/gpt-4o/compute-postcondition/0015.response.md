The code subtracts 1 from the value of `left`. The original value of `left` was \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\). After subtracting 1, the new value of `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 1\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\), `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`, `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 1\)**
