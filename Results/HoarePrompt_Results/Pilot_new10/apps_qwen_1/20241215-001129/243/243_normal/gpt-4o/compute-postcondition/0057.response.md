Postcondition: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` must be less than `high`; `mid` is updated to \((low + high) // 2\); `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`; if `zeroes > m`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `result` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `right` is incremented to a value where `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. All other variables (`left`, `mid`, `zeroes`, `low`, `high`) retain their values from the last iteration.**
