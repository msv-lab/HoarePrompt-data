Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
- `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1` depending on the value of `zeroes` relative to `m`.
- `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`.
- `mid` remains the same in the if part and is updated to \((low + high) // 2\) in the else part.
- `zeroes` remains the same in the if part and is updated to the value returned by `func_1(mid)` in the else part.
- `result` remains unchanged in the if part. In the else part, `right` is incremented to a value where `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.
- `left` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration in both parts.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```
while low <= high:
```

### Loop Body Analysis
We need to determine the conditions under which the loop can continue executing. The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

#### Case 1: `if zeroes > m`
- `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

For the loop to continue, we need:
\[ \text{low} \leq \text{high} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ (\text{mid} + 1) \leq (\text{mid} - 1) \]

This inequality is never true, so this case cannot be used to ensure the loop continues.

#### Case 2: `else` (i.e., `zeroes <= m`)
- `mid` is updated to \((low + high) // 2\).
- `zeroes` is updated to `func_1(mid)`.
- `right` is incremented to a value where `func_1(right)` is no longer equal to `m`, and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.

For the loop to continue, we need:
\[ \text{low} \leq \text{high} \]
This is always true as long as `low` and `high` have not crossed each other, which they haven't since the loop is still active.

### Conclusion
Since the loop condition `low <= high` must hold true for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `low` does not exceed `high`. Given the current values of `low` and `high`, no adjustments are necessary as long as the loop has not yet terminated due to `low > high`.

### Final State Adjustment
No state adjustments are needed for the loop to continue. The loop can continue as long as the initial conditions hold true.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`, `mid` is updated to \((low + high) // 2\) in the else part, `zeroes` is updated to `func_1(mid)` in the else part, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` in the else part, and `left` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration.**
