The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `m`. `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 100,000. The function returns a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where `left` and `right` are determined based on the conditions within the loop: if `zeroes < m`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`, and `high` remains `5 * (m + 1)`. If `zeroes > m`, then `low` remains unchanged and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `zeroes == m`, then `left` is found by decrementing from `mid` until `func_1(left) != m`, and `right` is found by incrementing from `mid + 1` until `func_1(right) != m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `m`, returns a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` based on the conditions involving `zeroes`, `low`, `high`, and `func_1`.**
