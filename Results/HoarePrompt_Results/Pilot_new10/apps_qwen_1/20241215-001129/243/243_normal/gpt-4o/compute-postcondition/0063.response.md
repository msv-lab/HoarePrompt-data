The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. This means that the previous value of `high` (which was `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`) is no longer valid, and it is now `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the precondition.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`, `high` is now `mid - 1`, `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` in the else part, and `left` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration.**
