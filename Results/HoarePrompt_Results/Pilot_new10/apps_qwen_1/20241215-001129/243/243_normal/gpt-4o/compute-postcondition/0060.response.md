The code `mid = (low + high) // 2` updates the variable `mid` to be the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The values of `low`, `high`, `zeroes`, `result`, `left`, and `func_1(mid)` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid - 1`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `zeroes > m`, `mid` is now \((low + high) // 2\), `zeroes` is updated to `func_1(mid)` in the else part, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` in the else part, and `left` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration.**
