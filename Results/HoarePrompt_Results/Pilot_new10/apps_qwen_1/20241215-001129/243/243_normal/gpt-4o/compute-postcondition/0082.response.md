The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or block of code. In this case, since there is no loop or block of code provided, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply indicates that the process would exit the current context, but no changes are made to the variables `right`, `result`, `low`, `high`, or `func_1`.

Output State: **`right` is the smallest integer greater than \((low + high) // 2 + 1\) such that `func_1(right)` is not equal to `m`, and `func_1(right - 1)` must equal `m`; `result` is a list ranging from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
