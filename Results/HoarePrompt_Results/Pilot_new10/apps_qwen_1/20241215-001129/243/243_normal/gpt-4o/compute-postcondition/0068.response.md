To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
   - `low` and `high` are initialized in such a way that `func_1(mid)` returns `m` when `left` is equal to `mid`.
   - `mid` is calculated as \((low + high) // 2\).
   - `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(mid)`.
   - `result` is an empty list.
   - `left` is calculated as \((low + high) // 2 - 1\).
   - `high` retains its value from the last iteration.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 1\).
   - `high` retains its value from the last iteration.
   - `func_1(left)` equals `m`.

For the loop to continue executing one more time, `func_1(left)` must still equal `m` at the start of the next iteration. This means that the values of `low` and `high` need to be adjusted in such a way that `left` can still be \((low + high) // 2 - 1\) and `func_1(left)` should still return `m`.

4. **Determining Adjustments**:
   - Since `func_1(left)` is currently returning `m`, the condition `func_1(left) == m` holds true.
   - To ensure the loop can continue, we need to keep `func_1(left)` returning `m`. This requires maintaining the invariant that `left` can still satisfy the condition where `func_1(left)` returns `m`.

Given that `left` is defined as \((low + high) // 2 - 1\), and assuming that `func_1(mid)` is correctly implemented, we don't need to explicitly adjust `low` or `high` directly unless we know their specific values. However, we must ensure that `left` remains valid and `func_1(left)` still returns `m`.

Since the exact values of `low` and `high` are not provided and only `high` retains its value from the last iteration, we need to ensure that the new value of `low` allows `left` to still be a valid index that makes `func_1(left)` return `m`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `high` remains consistent with the previous state, and `low` is adjusted in a way that maintains the condition `func_1(left) == m`.

State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\); `low` and `high` retain their values from the last iteration; `func_1(left) == m` where `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 1\)**
