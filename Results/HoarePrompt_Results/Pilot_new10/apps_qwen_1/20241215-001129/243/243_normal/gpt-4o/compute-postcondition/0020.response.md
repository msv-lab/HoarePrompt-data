Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\), `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`, `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - k\), where `k` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, and `func_1(left)` must not be equal to `m`**.
