`left` is decremented by 1. The value of `left` was originally \((low + high) // 2 - 2\). After decrementing, `left` becomes \((low + high) // 2 - 3\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` must be less than `high`, `left` is \((low + high) // 2 - 3\), `zeroes` is the value returned by `func_1(left)` and must be equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list, and `high` and `right` must be such that the condition `low < high` is satisfied after the next iteration.**
