To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop statement:

- The loop condition is `func_1(left) == m`.
- After the previous iteration, the following states are known:
  - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\).
  - `low` is 0.
  - `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\).
  - `result` is an empty list.
  - `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\).
  - `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`.
  - `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 1\).

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `func_1(left) == m` must be false, meaning `func_1(left)` should not be equal to `m`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `low = 0`.
   - `high = 5 \times (m + 1)`.
   - `mid = (5 \times (m + 1)) // 2`.
   - `left = mid - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `func_1(left) == m`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to continue, `func_1(left)` must not be equal to `m`.
   - Given that `left = mid - 1`, we need to ensure that `func_1(mid - 1) != m`.

Since the only condition affecting the loop continuation is `func_1(left) == m`, and `left` is defined as `mid - 1`, we need to adjust `func_1(mid - 1)` to be different from `m`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 100,000\), `low` is 0, `high` is \(5 \times (m + 1)\), `result` is an empty list, `mid` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2\), `zeroes` is `func_1(mid)`, `left` is \((5 \times (m + 1)) // 2 - 1\), and `func_1(left)` must not be equal to `m`**.
