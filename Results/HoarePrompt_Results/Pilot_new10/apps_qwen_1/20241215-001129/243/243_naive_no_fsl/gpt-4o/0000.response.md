Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `m` is very large (close to the upper limit of 100,000). Specifically, the binary search approach in `func_2` might fail to find the correct range of `n` values because the difference between consecutive `n` values that have exactly `m` trailing zeroes can be quite large. This can lead to missing some valid `n` values or incorrectly concluding that no such `n` exists.

For example, consider the case when `m` is close to its maximum value (e.g., `m = 100,000`). The actual number of trailing zeroes in factorials grows relatively slowly, and the binary search might not accurately pinpoint the range of `n` values that satisfy the condition. Therefore, the program might either miss some valid `n` values or incorrectly report that no such `n` exists.

To fix this, a more precise method of finding the range of `n` values, such as using a step-by-step increment approach combined with the trailing zero counting function, would be necessary.
