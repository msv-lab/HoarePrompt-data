`A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces. The input is expected to be `n` integers separated by spaces, where `n` is the number of elements in the array `A`. The initial state of `n` is the integer value entered by the user, and `A` is not yet defined. After executing the code, `A` will be a list of integers. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers**
