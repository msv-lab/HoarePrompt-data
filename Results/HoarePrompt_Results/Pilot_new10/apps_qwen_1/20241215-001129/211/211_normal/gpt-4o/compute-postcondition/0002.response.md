`total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `A`. The initial value of `n` is the integer value entered by the user, and `A` is a list of `n` integers. After executing the code, the value of `total_sum` will be the sum of all integers in `A`, but the individual values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A`.**
