Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a flaw in how it handles the case where the array consists entirely of zeros. According to the problem description, if the array consists entirely of zeros, the program should print "NO". However, the current implementation will incorrectly identify such an array as valid and split it into individual elements, which does not meet the requirement. For example, consider the input:

```
1
0
```

The expected output is "NO", but the current code will output "YES" and proceed to split the array into individual elements, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly.
