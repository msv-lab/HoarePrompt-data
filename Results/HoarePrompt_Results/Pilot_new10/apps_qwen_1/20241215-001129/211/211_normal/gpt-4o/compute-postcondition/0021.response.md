The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 3, and `total_sum` is 0.**
