Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the subarrays formed have a non-zero sum. As demonstrated by the example input `1 -1 2`, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it assumes that if the total sum is zero, no valid split exists. However, a valid split (`1 -1` and `2`) does exist, where both subarrays have a non-zero sum. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in certain scenarios.
