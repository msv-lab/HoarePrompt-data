The code prints the string '2'. This does not affect the values of any variables. The only change is the output printed to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `A[i]` is not 0; printed output is '2'**
