The code snippet prints the string '2'. This action does not affect the values of any variables but only outputs a string to the console. Therefore, the initial values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0; printed '2'**
