Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is `n`, and if any element in `A` is not 0, the loop breaks and prints 'YES', '2', '1', and the index + 1, followed by the index + 2 and `n`. If no element in `A` is not 0, the loop does not execute and prints 'NO'.**
