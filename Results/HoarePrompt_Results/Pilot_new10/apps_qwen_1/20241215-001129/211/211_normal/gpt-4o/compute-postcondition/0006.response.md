The code `print('1', n)` prints the string '1' followed by the value of `n`. However, this does not assign any new values to variables. The value of `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state. The other variables (`A` and `total_sum`) are not affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and is not equal to 0**
