The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variables; it only prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `n` being the integer value entered by the user, `A` being a list of `n` integers, and `total_sum` being the sum of all elements in `A`, which is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and is not equal to 0**
