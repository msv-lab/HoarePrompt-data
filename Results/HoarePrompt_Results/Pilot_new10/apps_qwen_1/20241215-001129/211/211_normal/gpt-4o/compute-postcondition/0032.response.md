The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of elements in the array `A`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3) representing the elements of the array `A`. 

The function does not return any value directly but processes the array `A`. Based on the given constraints and relationships, the function likely computes something about the array `A`, but since no specific computation is mentioned in the problem statement, we focus on the input and output behavior.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read an integer `n` followed by `n` integers from the input, forming an array `A`, and then perform some unspecified operation on the array `A`.
