The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, `A` is a list of `n` integers, `total_sum` is the sum of all elements in `A` and must be 0, `i` is 4**
