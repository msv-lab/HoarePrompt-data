Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code reveals that the program does not correctly handle cases where the array can be split into subarrays with non-zero sums. Specifically, the program only checks if the total sum of the array is zero and then either outputs "YES" with the entire array as one subarray or finds the first non-zero element and splits the array there. However, the program does not ensure that each resulting subarray has a non-zero sum. For instance, consider the input `1 -1 2`. The total sum is zero, and the program would incorrectly output "NO". But a valid split is `1 -1` and `2`, both of which have non-zero sums. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate as the program does not guarantee that all resulting subarrays have non-zero sums.
