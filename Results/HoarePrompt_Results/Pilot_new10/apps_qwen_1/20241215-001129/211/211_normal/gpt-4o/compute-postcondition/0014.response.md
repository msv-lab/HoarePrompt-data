The `break` statement does not affect any variable values and merely breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no loop or switch-case structure in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **printed output is '2', `i` is an integer such that `i + 2` equals '2', `n` is any value**
