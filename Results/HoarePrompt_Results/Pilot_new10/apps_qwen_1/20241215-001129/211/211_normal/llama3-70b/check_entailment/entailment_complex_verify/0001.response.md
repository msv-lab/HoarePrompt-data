Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program does not handle the case where the sum of the entire array is zero. According to the problem description, if the sum of the entire array is zero, the program should output "NO". However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "YES" and attempt to split the array, which violates the problem constraints. For example, the input "3\n0 0 0" will result in the output "YES", which is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
