`a` is assigned the values from the input split into a list and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `n` represents the number of elements in this list, so `a` will have exactly `n` elements. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of elements in the array A; `a` is a list of `n` integers**
