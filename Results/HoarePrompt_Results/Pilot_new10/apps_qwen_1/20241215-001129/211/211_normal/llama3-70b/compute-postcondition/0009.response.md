Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in the array A, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be non-negative.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` is a non-negative integer**: The initial value of `n` represents the number of elements in the array `a`, and it must be non-negative.
- **`a` is a list of `n` integers**: This remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`**: After the loop completes, `prefix_sum[i]` will store the cumulative sum up to index `i` in the list `a`. Specifically, `prefix_sum[i]` will be the sum of `a[0]` to `a[i-1]` for `1 <= i <= n+1`.
- **`i` is `n + 1`**: Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, `i` will be incremented to `n` and then the loop terminates, setting `i` to `n + 1`.
- **`n` must be non-negative**: This ensures the loop can execute at least once if `n > 0`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n == 0`), the initial state holds:
- `n` is `0`.
- `a` is an empty list (since `n` elements are required).
- `prefix_sum` is `[0]` (since there are no elements to sum).

Thus, the final state after all iterations is as described above.
