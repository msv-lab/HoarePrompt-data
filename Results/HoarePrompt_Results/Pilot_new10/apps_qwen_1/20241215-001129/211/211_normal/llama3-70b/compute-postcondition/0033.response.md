The code `print(k, l, n)` simply prints the values of the variables `k`, `l`, and `n`. Since these variables are not being modified within the provided code snippet, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the number of iterations the loop executed plus 1, `l` is the last value of `r` for which the condition `prefix_sum[r] != 0 and prefix_sum[r] != prefix_sum[n]` was satisfied, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the values of `k`, `l`, and `n` are printed.**
