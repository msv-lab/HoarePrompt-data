The code `l = r` assigns the value of `r` to `l`. Given the initial conditions, `r` is `n + 1`. Therefore, `l` is now also `n + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `prefix_sum` is a list where each element `prefix_sum[i]` (for `0 <= i <= n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_sum[n]` is not equal to `0`, `k` is `3`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n + 1`.**
