The code `prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]` updates the value of `prefix_sum[i + 1]` to be the sum of `prefix_sum[i]` and `a[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 4
- `prefix_sum[4]` is `prefix_sum[3] + a[3]`
- `n` remains the same and is greater than 0

Since `i` is 4, `i + 1` is 5. So, `prefix_sum[5]` is updated to be `prefix_sum[4] + a[4]`. We can express this as:

- `prefix_sum[5]` is `prefix_sum[3] + a[3] + a[4]`

The other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `prefix_sum[4]` is `prefix_sum[3] + a[3]`, `prefix_sum[5]` is `prefix_sum[3] + a[3] + a[4]`, `n` remains the same and is greater than 0**
