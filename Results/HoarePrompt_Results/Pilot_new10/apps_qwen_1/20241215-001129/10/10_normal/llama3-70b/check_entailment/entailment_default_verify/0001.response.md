Final: **True**

Reason: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function accurately counts the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa, and the main loop correctly identifies the sofa that matches the given conditions. The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, counting the sofas in the specified directions without special handling for boundary conditions, which is not required according to the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
