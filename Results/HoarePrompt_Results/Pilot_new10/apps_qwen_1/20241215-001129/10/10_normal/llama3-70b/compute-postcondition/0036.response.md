Output State: **`sofas` contains all the coordinates of the sofas in the storehouse, `sofa` is the original sofa coordinates, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the storehouse, `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse, `left` is the count of sofas to the left of `sofa`, `right` is the count of sofas to the right of `sofa`, `top` is the count of sofas above `sofa`, and `bottom` is the count of sofas below `sofa`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each sofa in `sofas` except for the current `sofa`.
- For each sofa `s` in `sofas` that is different from the current `sofa`:
  - If the current `sofa` is to the left of `s` and they share the same y-coordinate, `left` is incremented.
  - If the current `sofa` is to the right of `s` and they share the same y-coordinate, `right` is incremented.
  - If the current `sofa` is above `s` and they share the same x-coordinate, `top` is incremented.
  - If the current `sofa` is below `s` and they share the same x-coordinate, `bottom` is incremented.

After the loop completes, all possible comparisons have been made, and the counts of sofas in each direction (`left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`) will reflect the number of sofas in those respective positions relative to the original `sofa`.
