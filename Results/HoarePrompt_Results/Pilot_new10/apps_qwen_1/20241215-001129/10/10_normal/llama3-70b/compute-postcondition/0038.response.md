The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa` and `sofas`. 

- `sofa` is a list containing four integers representing the coordinates of a specific sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), where each sofa is defined by two cells that share a side.
- `sofas` is a list of such lists representing the coordinates of all sofas in the storehouse.

The function returns four values: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`, which represent the count of sofas to the left, right, above, and below the original sofa `sofa` respectively.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a specific sofa's coordinates and a list of all sofas' coordinates, and return the counts of sofas located to the left, right, above, and below the specified sofa.
