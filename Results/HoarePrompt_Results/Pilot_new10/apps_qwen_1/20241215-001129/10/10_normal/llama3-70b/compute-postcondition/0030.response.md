Postcondition: ***`sofas` must contain at least one list of coordinates, `sofa` is the second element in `sofas`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the storehouse, `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are the dimensions of the storehouse. If `sofa[0][0] > s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]`, then `left` is set to 3. Otherwise, the values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged.***
