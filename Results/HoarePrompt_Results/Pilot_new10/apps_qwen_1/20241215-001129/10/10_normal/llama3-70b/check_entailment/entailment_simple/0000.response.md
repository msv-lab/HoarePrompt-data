Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program adheres to the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input values `d`, `n`, `m`, the coordinates of each sofa, and the counts `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`.

2. **Data Structure Usage**:
   - The sofas are stored in a list `sofas`, which contains tuples representing the coordinates of each sofa. This structure ensures easy access to each sofa's position for comparison.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the counts of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. It iterates over all sofas, excluding the current one, and updates the counts based on relative positions.
   - The function correctly checks if the current sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa by comparing their coordinates. This logic aligns with the problem description.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program iterates over each sofa and calls `func_1` to get the counts of sofas around it.
   - If the calculated counts match the required counts (`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`), it prints the index of the current sofa plus one (since indices are 0-based) and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no sofa matches the required counts, it prints `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the counts might not match any sofa perfectly, ensuring that the correct response is `-1` when no matching sofa is found.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately follows the problem description, correctly identifying the sofa based on the given conditions and handling all possible scenarios as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
