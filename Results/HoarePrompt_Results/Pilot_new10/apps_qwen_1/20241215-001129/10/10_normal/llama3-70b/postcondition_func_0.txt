The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sofa`, a list containing the coordinates of a specific sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), and `sofas`, a list of such lists representing the coordinates of all sofas in the storehouse. The function counts and returns the number of sofas located to the left, right, above, and below the specified sofa. Specifically, it returns `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`, which represent the counts of sofas in those respective directions. The function does not account for cases where the specified sofa is on the boundary or edge of the storehouse, so these counts might be zero if the sofa is adjacent to the edges.
