The code initializes four variables: `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` to 0. These variables do not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state, which include `sofa`, `sofas`, `n`, `m`, and `d`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with only these four new variables initialized to 0.

Output State: **`sofa` is a list containing four integers representing the coordinates of a sofa (x1, y1, x2, y2), and `sofas` is a list of such lists representing the coordinates of all sofas in the storehouse. Each sofa is defined by two cells that share a side, and no cell is covered by more than one sofa. The lengths of the storehouse are represented by `n` and `m`, and `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse. `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.**
