The value of `right` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of the other variables (`sofas`, `sofa`, `n`, `m`, `d`, `left`, and `top`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sofas` must contain at least one list of coordinates, `sofa` is the next element in `sofas` that is different from the current `sofa`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the storehouse, `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, and `top` is 1. If `sofa[0][0] < s[0][0]` and `sofa[0][1] == s[0][1]`, then `left` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
