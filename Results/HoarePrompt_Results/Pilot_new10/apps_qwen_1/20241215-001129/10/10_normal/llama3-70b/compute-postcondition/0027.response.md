The code `left += 1` increments the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial state where `left` is either 2 or remains unchanged, the value of `left` will become 3.

Output State: **`sofas` must contain at least one list of coordinates, `sofa` is the second element in `sofas`, `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the storehouse, `d` is the number of sofas in the storehouse, `left` is 3, `right` is 2, `top` is 2, and `bottom` is 3.**
