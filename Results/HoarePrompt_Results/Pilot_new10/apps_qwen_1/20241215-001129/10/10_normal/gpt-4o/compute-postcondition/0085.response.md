`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is 0, so `right_count[0]` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `y1_j` is the second element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `x2_j` is the third element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `y2_j` is the fourth element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, and `right_count[0]` is 1.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `y1_j` is the second element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `x2_j` is the third element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `y2_j` is the fourth element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, and `right_count[0]` is 1.**
