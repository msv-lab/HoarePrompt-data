The code `right_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `right_count[i]` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i + 1`, `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x1_j` equals `sofas[j][0]`, `y1_j` equals `sofas[j][1]`, `x2_j` equals `sofas[j][2]`, `y2_j` equals `sofas[j][3]`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 2 if the condition `(y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j)` is met; otherwise, it is incremented by 1, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and `bottom_count[i]` is further incremented by 1 if the condition `(y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j)` is met, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.**
