State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is equal to `d-1`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 0 and increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.
2. The loop continues as long as `i < d`.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `d-1`. This means the condition `i < d` is no longer true, and the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `d`.

State: **`i` must be less than `d`**
