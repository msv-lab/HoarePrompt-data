The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are assigned the values from the second tuple in the `sofas` list**
