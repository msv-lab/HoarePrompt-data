The code snippet `left_count[i] += 1` increments the value of `left_count[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 0, this line of code specifically increments `left_count[0]` by 1.

Since no other variables are affected by this code, and the precondition values of the other variables remain unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 1, `x1_1` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_1` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_1` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_1` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_j` is `y1_1`, `y2_j` is `y2_1`, and `left_count[0]` is 1 more than its original value.**
