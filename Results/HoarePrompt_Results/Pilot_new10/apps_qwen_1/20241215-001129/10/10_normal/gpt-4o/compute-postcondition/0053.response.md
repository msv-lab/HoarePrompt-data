`right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 0, `right_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `right_count` is not specified, so we assume it is a list of integers initialized to 0. Therefore, `right_count[0]` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` contains exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is `x1_2`, `y1_j` is `y1_2`, `x2_j` is `x2_2`, `y2_j` is `y2_2`, `right_count[0]` is 1**
