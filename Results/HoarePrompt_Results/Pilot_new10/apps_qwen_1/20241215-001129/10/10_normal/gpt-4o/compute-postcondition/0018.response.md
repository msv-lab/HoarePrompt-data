To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions specified in the for loop statement and the given initial state.

The for loop is defined as follows:
```python
for i in range(d):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `d-1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` should be able to take the value `0`.

2. **Variable `d`:**
   - It is mentioned that `d` is an integer greater than 0.
   - This condition is already satisfied based on the given state.

3. **Variable `sofas`:**
   - `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.
   - Since `i` will iterate from `0` to `d-1`, `sofas[i]` should exist for all `i` in this range.
   - Therefore, `sofas` must contain at least `d` tuples.

### Summary of Adjusted States:

- `d` is an integer greater than 0 (already given).
- `i` should start at `0` to begin the loop.
- `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples.

### Final Answer:
State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples**
