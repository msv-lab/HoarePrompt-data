`left_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is initially 0, `left_count[0]` is updated to its original value plus 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 0, `x1` is greater than `x2_j`, `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, `right_count[0]` is 1 more than its original value, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`; `left_count[0]` is 1 more than its original value.
