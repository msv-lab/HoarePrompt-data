State: **`d` is the integer input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is an empty list, `d` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(d)` depends on the value of `d`.
2. For the loop to execute, `d` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(d)` generates numbers from 0 to `d-1`.
3. The values of `n`, `m`, and the initial state of `sofas` do not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state must include `d` being greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
