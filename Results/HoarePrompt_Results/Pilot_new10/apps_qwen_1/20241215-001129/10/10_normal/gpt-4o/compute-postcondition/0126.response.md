The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i + 1`, `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x1_j` equals `sofas[i][0]`, `y1_j` equals `sofas[i][1]`, `x2_j` equals `sofas[i][2]`, `y2_j` equals `sofas[i][3]`, `bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 2 if the condition `(y1 > y2_j and y2 > y2_j)` is met; otherwise, it is incremented by 1, `top_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and `bottom_count[i]` is further incremented by 1 if the condition `(y1 < y1_j and y2 < y1_j)` is met.**
