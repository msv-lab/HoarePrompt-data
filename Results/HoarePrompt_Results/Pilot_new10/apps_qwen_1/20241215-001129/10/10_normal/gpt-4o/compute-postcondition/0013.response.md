The code `cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b = map(int, input().strip().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into four parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, and `cnt_b` respectively. The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers input by the user; `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are integers input by the user**.
