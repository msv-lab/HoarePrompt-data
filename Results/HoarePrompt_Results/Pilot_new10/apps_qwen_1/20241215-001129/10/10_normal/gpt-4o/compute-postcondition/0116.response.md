Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i`, `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x1_j` equals `sofas[i][0]`, `y1_j` equals `sofas[i][1]`, `x2_j` equals `sofas[i][2]`, `y2_j` equals `sofas[i][3]`. Given the condition `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1.***
