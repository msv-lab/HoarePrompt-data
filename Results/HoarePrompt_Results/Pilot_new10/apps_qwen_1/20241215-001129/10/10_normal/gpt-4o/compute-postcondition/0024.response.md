The code assigns the values from the tuple `sofas[j]` to the variables `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j`. Before this assignment, `i` is equal to `j`. After the assignment, the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are taken from `sofas[j]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 0, `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`.**
