The code appends a tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. This means that `sofas` now contains this tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is the integer input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`), `x1` is the third integer input by the user, `y1` is the fourth integer input by the user, `x2` is the fifth integer input by the user, `y2` is the sixth integer input by the user, `d` must be greater than 0**
