Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` contains exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 2, `x1_2` is the first element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_2` is the second element of `sofas[2]`, `x2_2` is the third element of `sofas[2]`, `y2_2` is the fourth element of `sofas[2]`, `y1_j` is `y1_2`, `y2_j` is `y2_2`. The values of `y1_j` and `y2_j` do not change because the condition `i == j` evaluates to false (since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2).***
