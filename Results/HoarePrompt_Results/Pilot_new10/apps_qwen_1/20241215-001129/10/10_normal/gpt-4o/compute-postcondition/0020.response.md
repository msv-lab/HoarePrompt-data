State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `j` is used as the loop counter in the `range(d)` function. For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range defined by `range(d)`.
2. Initially, `j` is set to 0. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `j` needs to be less than `d`.
3. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is 0 initially and that `d` is greater than 0 to allow for at least one iteration of the loop.

Hence, the required state adjustments are that `j` should be 0 (to match the initial condition) and `d` should be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can run at least once.
