Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `y1_j` is the second element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `x2_j` is the third element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list. If `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j`, then `left_count[0]` is 1 and `right_count[0]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `left_count[0]` and `right_count[0]` remain unchanged.***
