Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x1_j` is the first element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `y1_j` is the second element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, `x2_j` is the third element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list, and `y2_j` is the fourth element of the second tuple in the `sofas` list; if `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j`, then `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `left_count[0]`, `right_count[0]`, `bottom_count[0]`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` remain unchanged.***
