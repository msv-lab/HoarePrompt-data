Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 0, `x1 < x1_j` and `x2 < x1_j`. `x1_j` is the first element of `sofas[0]`, `y1_j` is the second element of `sofas[0]`, `x2_j` is the third element of `sofas[0]`, `y2_j` is the fourth element of `sofas[0]`***
