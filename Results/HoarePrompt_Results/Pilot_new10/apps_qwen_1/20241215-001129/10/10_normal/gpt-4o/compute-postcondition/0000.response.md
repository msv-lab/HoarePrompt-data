The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to `d`. This means `d` will now hold the value of the integer entered by the user, and no other variables are affected. The precondition that `d` is an integer such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10^5\) remains valid.

Output State: **`d` is the integer input by the user, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, there are d lines each containing four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 representing the coordinates of the i-th sofa, where (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) are neighboring cells and no cell is covered by more than one sofa, and the last line contains four integers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} such that 0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1.**
