`sofas` is a list containing the tuples (the third integer input by the user, the fourth integer input by the user, the fifth integer input by the user, the sixth integer input by the user), and an additional tuple with new values for `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. The code appends a new tuple `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` to the list `sofas`. The values of `d`, `n`, `m`, and the existing elements in `sofas` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (the third integer input by the user, the fourth integer input by the user, the fifth integer input by the user, the sixth integer input by the user) and an additional tuple with values `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` appended.**
