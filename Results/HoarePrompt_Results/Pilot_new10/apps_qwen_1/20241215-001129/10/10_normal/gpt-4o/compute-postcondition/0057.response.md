`bottom_count[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 0, `bottom_count[0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and all other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` contains exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is `x1_2`, `y1_j` is `y1_2`, `x2_j` is `x2_2`, `y2_j` is `y2_2`, and `right_count[0]` is 1; `bottom_count[0]` is increased by 1.**
