`left_count[i]` is assigned the value of `left_count[i] + 1`. Since `i` is less than `d` and `d` is greater than 0, `i` remains unchanged. Also, the conditions `x1 > x2_j` and `x2 > x2_j` leading to the increase of `right_count[i]` by 1 are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than `d`, `d` is greater than 0, `j` equals `i`, `x1` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x2` is less than `sofas[i][0]`, `x1_j` equals `sofas[i][0]`, `y1_j` equals `sofas[i][1]`, `x2_j` equals `sofas[i][2]`, `y2_j` equals `sofas[i][3]`, `right_count[i]` is increased by 1, `left_count[i]` is increased by 1**
