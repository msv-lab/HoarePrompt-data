The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables `d`, `i`, `sofas`, `j`, `x1_1`, `y1_1`, `x2_1`, `y2_1`, `y1`, `y2`, `bottom_count`, and `left_count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 1, `x1_1` is the first element of `sofas[1]`, `y1_1` is the second element of `sofas[1]`, `x2_1` is the third element of `sofas[1]`, `y2_1` is the fourth element of `sofas[1]`, `y1` is compared to `y2_1` and `y2` is compared to `y2_1`, if `y1 > y2_1` and `y2 > y2_1` then `bottom_count[0]` is 2, otherwise `left_count[0]` is 1 more than its original value. The loop continues.**
