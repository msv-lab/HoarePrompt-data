Postcondition: ***`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `sofas` contains exactly `d` tuples, `j` is 2, `x1_j` is `x1_2`, `y1_j` is `y1_2`, `x2_j` is `x2_2`, `y2_j` is `y2_2`, and `right_count[0]` is 1. If `y1 < y1_j` and `y2 < y1_j` are true, then `bottom_count[0]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
