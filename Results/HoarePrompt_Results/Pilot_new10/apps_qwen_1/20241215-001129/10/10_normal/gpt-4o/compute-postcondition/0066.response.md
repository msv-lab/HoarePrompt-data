The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since the initial state mentions that `i` and `j` are both 0 and `j` must iterate from 0 to `d-1`, the loop will continue to run until `j` reaches `d-1`. However, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables directly; it only affects the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state and the fact that `continue` does not modify any variables, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to `j`, `i` and `j` are both 0, `sofas` must contain exactly `d` tuples, `j` must iterate from 0 to `d-1` for the loop to execute.**
