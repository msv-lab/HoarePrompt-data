The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it processes input data that includes an integer `d` such that \(1 \leq d \leq 10^5\), two integers `n` and `m` such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5\), and `d` lines each containing four integers \(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\) representing the coordinates of the \(i\)-th sofa, where \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are neighboring cells and no cell is covered by more than one sofa. Additionally, the last line contains four integers \(cnt_{l}\), \(cnt_{r}\), \(cnt_{t}\), \(cnt_{b}\) such that \(0 \leq cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} \leq d - 1\).

Based on the provided input, the function returns a value determined by the last line of the input, specifically the values of \(cnt_{l}\), \(cnt_{r}\), \(cnt_{t}\), and \(cnt_{b}\).

Functionality: **The function processes input data including an integer \(d\), two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and \(d\) lines of coordinates for sofas. It then returns a value based on the last line of input, which consists of four integers \(cnt_{l}\), \(cnt_{r}\), \(cnt_{t}\), and \(cnt_{b}\).**
