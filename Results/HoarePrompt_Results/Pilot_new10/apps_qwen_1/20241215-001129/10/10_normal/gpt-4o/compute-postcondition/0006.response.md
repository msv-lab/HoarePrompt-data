According to the code, the loop will execute `d` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:

- `d` is the integer input by the user (and `d` must be greater than 0).
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `m` is the second integer input by the user.
- `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`).
- `x1` is the third integer input by the user.
- `y1` is the fourth integer input by the user.
- `x2` is the fifth integer input by the user.
- `y2` is the sixth integer input by the user.

The loop variable `_` is just an underscore, indicating that it is not being used within the loop. The loop will execute `d` times, and since `d` must be greater than 0, the loop can indeed execute again if `d` is greater than 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be greater than 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `d` is decreased by 1 and must still be greater than 0.

State: **`d` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, `sofas` is a list containing the tuple (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`), `x1` is the third integer input by the user, `y1` is the fourth integer input by the user, `x2` is the fifth integer input by the user, `y2` is the sixth integer input by the user**
