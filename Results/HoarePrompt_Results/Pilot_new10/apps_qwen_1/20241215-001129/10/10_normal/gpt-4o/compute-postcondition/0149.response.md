Output State: **`i` is less than `d`, `d` is a positive integer, `right_count[i]`, `left_count[i]`, `top_count[i]`, and `bottom_count[i]` are the counts of sofas satisfying specific conditions relative to `sofas[i]`. Specifically, `right_count[i]` is the count of sofas to the right of `sofas[i]` in both the x1 and x2 coordinates, `left_count[i]` is the count of sofas to the left of `sofas[i]` in both the x1 and x2 coordinates, `top_count[i]` is the count of sofas above `sofas[i]` in both the y1 and y2 coordinates, and `bottom_count[i]` is the count of sofas below `sofas[i]` in both the y1 and y2 coordinates.**
