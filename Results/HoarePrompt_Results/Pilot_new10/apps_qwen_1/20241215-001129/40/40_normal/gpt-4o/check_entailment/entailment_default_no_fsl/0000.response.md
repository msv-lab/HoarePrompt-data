Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the longest non-palindrome substring. The code checks only a few specific slices of the string (`s[1:]` and `s[:-1]`) instead of checking all possible substrings. Additionally, the logic for determining the longest non-palindrome substring is flawed.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check all possible substrings of the input string and determine the longest one that is not a palindrome. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
s = input().strip()

max_length = 0

for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(s)+1):
        substring = s[i:j]
        if not func_1(substring):
            max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))

print(max_length)

def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```

This version iterates over all possible substrings and uses the `func_1` function to check if a substring is a palindrome. It keeps track of the maximum length of a non-palindrome substring found.
