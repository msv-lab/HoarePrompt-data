Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( \texttt{i} \) is not equal to \( \texttt{n} \)
- \( \texttt{n} \) must be greater than 0
- \( \texttt{max_len} \) is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in \( \texttt{s} \)
- \( \texttt{substr} \) is a substring of \( \texttt{s} \) from index \( \texttt{i} \) to index \( \texttt{j} - 1 \)

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n \).
2. **Initial Values**:
   - \( \texttt{i} \neq \texttt{n} \)
   - \( \texttt{n} > 0 \)
   - \( \texttt{max_len} \) is initialized (not specified but assumed to be known)
   - \( \texttt{substr} \) is the substring from \( \texttt{i} \) to \( \texttt{j} - 1 \)

### Adjusting States for Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, \( j \) must be incremented and checked against the upper limit \( n \).

1. **Increment \( j \)**: In each iteration, \( j \) is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, \( j \) will be \( j + 1 \).
2. **Check Condition**: The loop continues as long as \( j < n + 1 \). Thus, for the next iteration, \( j \) should be within the range \( i + 1 \) to \( n \).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- \( \texttt{i} \) remains unchanged (no change in the value of \( i \))
- \( \texttt{n} \) remains unchanged (no change in the value of \( n \))
- \( \texttt{max_len} \) remains unchanged (since no new palindromic substrings are found yet)
- \( \texttt{substr} \) becomes the substring from \( \texttt{i} \) to \( \texttt{j} \)

### Final State:
State: **`i` is not equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`.**

Note that \( j \) is now \( j + 1 \), but since the exact value of \( j \) is not provided, we use the variable \( j \) to represent the new value.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`i` is not equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`.**
