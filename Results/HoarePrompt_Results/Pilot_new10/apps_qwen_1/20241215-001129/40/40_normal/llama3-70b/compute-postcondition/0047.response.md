Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
- `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `n` (inclusive).

```python
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    substr = s[i:j]
    if substr != substr[::-1]:
        max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - When `i` is `n`, the loop starts with the outermost index `i` and checks substrings starting from `i` to `n-1`.

2. **First Iteration (i = n):**
   - No valid `j` exists since `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n`, and `i` is `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop body does not execute, and the initial values of `max_len` and `substr` remain unchanged.
   - `i` decreases to `n-1`.

3. **Second Iteration (i = n-1):**
   - The loop starts with `j` ranging from `n-1 + 1` to `n`.
   - `j` only takes the value `n`.
   - `substr = s[n-1:n]` which is an empty string `''`.
   - Since `substr` is not a palindrome, `max_len` remains unchanged (still `max_len` from the initial state).
   - `i` decreases to `n-2`.

4. **Subsequent Iterations (i = n-2, n-3, ..., 0):**
   - The loop continues to decrease `i` until `i` reaches 0.
   - For each `i`, `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n`.
   - `substr` is checked against its reverse. If `substr` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.
   - Eventually, when `i` reaches 0, `j` will range from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes all iterations, the following conditions hold:
- `max_len` will be the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `0` to any index up to `n-1`.
- `substr` will be the longest palindromic substring found.
- `i` will be 0.
- `n` remains a positive integer.

### Output State
Output State: **`max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index 0 to index `n-1`, `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index 0 to index `n-1`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer.**
