According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 0, `substr` is an empty string, `i` is `n`, and `n` is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i + 1 <= n` must still be true. Given that `i` is currently equal to `n`, this condition simplifies to `n + 1 > n`, which is always false. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because the condition for the loop's continuation (`i + 1 <= n`) is not satisfied.

However, if we assume there was a mistake in the initial conditions or the problem context, and we need to consider the next logical step, we would adjust the states based on the loop's requirement.

State: **`max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 0; `substr` is an empty string; `i` remains `n`; `n` remains a positive integer** (since the loop cannot execute, no change in `n` is needed).

Given the strict condition check, the final state remains as:

State: **`max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 0; `substr` is an empty string; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer**.
