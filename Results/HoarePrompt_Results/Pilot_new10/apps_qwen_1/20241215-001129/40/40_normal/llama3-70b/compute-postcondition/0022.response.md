The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the substring `substr`. Since `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1`, the length of `substr` is `j - i`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is not equal to `n`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`
- `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` and is not equal to its reverse

After executing the code, `max_len` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`, which is `j - i`.

Output State: **`i` is not equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the maximum of its current value and `j - i`, `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` and is not equal to its reverse**
