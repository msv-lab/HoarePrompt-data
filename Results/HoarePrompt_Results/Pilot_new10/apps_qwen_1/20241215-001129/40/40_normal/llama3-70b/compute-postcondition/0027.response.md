Postcondition: ***`i` is not equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the maximum length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` up to this point, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of the current `max_len` and the length of `substr`.***
