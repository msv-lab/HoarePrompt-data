The code snippet `substr = s[i:j]` assigns a substring of the string `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` (end-exclusive) to the variable `substr`. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state. Since `i` is equal to `n` (a positive integer), and the value of `j` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `substr`. 

The only thing we know for sure is that `substr` now holds a substring of `s` starting at index `n` up to index `j-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_len` is the maximum of its current value and 0; `substr` is a substring of `s` from index `n` to index `j-1`; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer**
