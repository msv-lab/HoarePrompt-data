The code snippet assigns the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j-1` (since `j` is not defined in the snippet) to `substr`. However, since `j` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact substring being assigned. Given the initial state and the lack of definition for `j`, we can only state that `substr` now holds a substring of `s` from index `i` to some index less than `j`.

Since `i` is equal to `n`, the assignment `substr = s[i:j]` will assign a substring of `s` starting from index `n` to `substr`, which would be an empty string because the start index `n` is beyond the end of the string.

Other variables remain unchanged: `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`; `substr` becomes the substring from index `n` to some index less than `j`, which is an empty string; `i` remains `n`; `n` remains a positive integer.

Output State: **`max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`; `substr` is an empty string; `i` is `n`; `n` is a positive integer.**
