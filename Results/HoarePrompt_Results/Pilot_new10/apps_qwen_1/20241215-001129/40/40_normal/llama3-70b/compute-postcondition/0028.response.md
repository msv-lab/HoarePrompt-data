Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is not equal to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `max_len` is the maximum length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` up to this point
   - `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `i` to index `j`
   - If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of the current `max_len` and the length of `substr`

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `i + 1` to `n`.
   - For each value of `j`, it checks if the substring `s[i:j]` is a palindrome.
   - If it is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is not equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `max_len` is the maximum length of the longest palindromic substring found so far.
   - `substr` is the substring from index `i` to index `j`.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs from `i + 1` to `n`, the next value of `j` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `i + 1`.
   - `i` remains the same as the loop variable `i` does not change inside the loop.
   - `max_len` may or may not be updated depending on the condition of the substring being a palindrome.
   - `substr` will now be the substring from index `i` to `i + 1`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `max_len` remains the same unless it was updated during the loop.
   - `substr` changes to the substring from index `i` to `i + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:
- `i` is the same.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `max_len` remains the same unless updated.
- `substr` is now the substring from index `i` to `i + 1`.

The final state is:
State: **`i` is the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` remains the same, `substr` is the substring from index `i` to `i + 1`**.
