Output State: **`max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`, `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs through every possible substring starting from each position `i` up to the end of the string `s` (i.e., up to `n-1`).
- For each substring `substr` starting from `i` to `j` where `j` ranges from `i+1` to `n`, the code checks if `substr` is not equal to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`).
- If `substr` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, meaning it has checked all possible starting points for substrings.
- By the end of the loop, `max_len` will hold the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`, and `substr` will be that longest palindromic substring.
- The variable `i` will be set to `n` because the loop terminates when `i` reaches `n`.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the process, as it represents the length of the string `s`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `max_len` will be the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s`, and `substr` will be the actual longest palindromic substring.
