Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code searches for the longest palindromic substring instead of the longest non-palindromic substring. According to the problem description, Ann changes the word into its longest substring that is not a palindrome. However, the current implementation finds the longest palindromic substring, which does not meet the requirement.

To fix this, the code should check if the substring is not a palindrome before updating `max_len`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr != substr[::-1]:  # Check if the substring is not a palindrome
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
    print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)
```

With this correction, the code will correctly identify the longest non-palindromic substring and return its length, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
