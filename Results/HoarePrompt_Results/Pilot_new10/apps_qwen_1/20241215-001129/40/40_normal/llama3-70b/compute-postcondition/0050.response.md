The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the function definition. However, based on the constraint, it seems there might be an implicit input that is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters. Since the function signature does not reflect this, we will consider the implicit input as part of the problem context.

Given the output cases are not specified, we can infer that the function likely processes this string and returns some value based on its content or properties.
