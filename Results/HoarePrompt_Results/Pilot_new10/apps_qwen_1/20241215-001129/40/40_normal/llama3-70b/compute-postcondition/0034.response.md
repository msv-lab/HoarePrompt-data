Let's analyze the given code and determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
   - `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `n`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Current State Check:**
   - Currently, `i` is `n`, and `j` starts from `i + 1`, which means `j` starts from `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` starts from `n + 1`, it is already greater than `n`, and thus the loop will not execute because the condition `j <= n` will fail immediately.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` needs to be decreased to a value such that `j` (starting from `i + 1`) can still be within the range `[i + 1, n]`.
   - Specifically, `i` should be set to a value less than `n` for the loop to start executing.

6. **Final State Before Next Iteration:**
   - `max_len` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `substr` remains the same for the same reason.
   - `i` is set to `n - 1` to allow the loop to start executing.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:

**State: `max_len` is the length of the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`, `substr` is the longest palindromic substring found in `s` from index `i` to index `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer.**
