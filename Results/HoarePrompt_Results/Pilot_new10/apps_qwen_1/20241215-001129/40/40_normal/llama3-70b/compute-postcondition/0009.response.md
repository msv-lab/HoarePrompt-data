Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `max_len` is the maximum length between the original `max_len` (which is 0) and the length of `substr` (which is `len(substr)`)
   - `substr` is a substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index `j`
   - If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is updated to `len(substr)`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `n + 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `max_len` is the maximum length between the original `max_len` (which is 0) and the length of `substr` (which is `len(substr)`)
   - `substr` is a substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index `j`
   - If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, `max_len` is updated to `len(substr)`

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the range `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Since `i` is 0, the next possible value for `j` is 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be set to 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `max_len` remains the same unless `substr` changes in the next iteration.
   - `substr` will now be the substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index `j`, which is 1.

6. **Updated State:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `max_len` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `substr` is now the substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_len` is the maximum length between the original `max_len` and the length of the substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index 1, and `substr` is the substring of `s` starting from index 0 and ending just before index 1**.
