Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description Requirement**: The task is to find the longest substring that is *not* a palindrome, not the longest palindromic substring. However, the current implementation is checking for palindromic substrings and returning their lengths.

2. **Current Implementation**: The program iterates through all possible substrings of the input string `s` and checks if each substring is a palindrome. It then calculates the length of the longest palindromic substring found. This does not meet the requirement since we need the longest substring that is *not* a palindrome.

3. **Example Counter-Case**:
   - Consider the input string `aaaaa`. According to the problem description, the output should be `0` because all substrings of `aaaaa` are palindromes, and there is no substring that is not a palindrome.
   - However, the current program would output `5` because the entire string `aaaaa` is a palindrome, and it finds this as the longest palindromic substring.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The program should iterate through all substrings and check if they are not palindromes.
   - Keep track of the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found.
   - If no non-palindromic substring is found, return `0`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    max_len = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substr = s[i:j]
            if substr != substr[::-1]:
                max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
    
    print(max_len if max_len > 0 else 0)
```

In this corrected version, the program checks for non-palindromic substrings instead of palindromic ones. This ensures that the program meets the problem description requirements.
