Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the longest non-palindrome substring. Specifically, the program checks for non-palindromic substrings starting from indices 1 and the end of the string, but this is insufficient to cover all possible cases. 

For example, consider the input `mum`. According to the problem description, the longest non-palindrome substring in `mum` is `mu` or `um`, which has a length of 2. However, the current implementation would not correctly identify this as it only checks the substrings starting from index 1 or the end of the string, missing the valid non-palindromic substrings.
