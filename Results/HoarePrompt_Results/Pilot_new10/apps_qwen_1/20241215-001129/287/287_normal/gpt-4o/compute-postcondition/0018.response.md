The code increments the value of `count` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `count` was initially 1. After the increment, `count` will be 2. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9, `i` must be such that \((i + 1) * (i + 1) \leq num\); `count` is 2**
