According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Specifically, the loop continues as long as `i * i <= num`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to continue executing, `i * i` must be less than or equal to `num`. Since `i` is 2, this translates to `4 <= num`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `num` must be such that when `i` is incremented, `i * i` is still less than or equal to `num`. The next value of `i` would be 3, and thus `9 <= num`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num` is at least 9.

State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9**, `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2.
