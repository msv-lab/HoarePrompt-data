Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of a given number \( n \). The code instead calculates the number of divisors of \( n \).

To illustrate, let's consider the example inputs:

- For \( n = 7 \):
  - Correct output should be 4, as the possible weights are 1, 2, 3, and 7.
  - But the code will output the number of divisors of 7, which is 2 (since 7 is a prime number).

- For \( n = 8 \):
  - Correct output should be 5, as the possible weights are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8.
  - But the code will output the number of divisors of 8, which is 4 (since the divisors are 1, 2, 4, and 8).

The code iterates from 1 to \(\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil\) and counts the divisors of \( n \). It does not handle the logic required to determine the number of different weights of splits.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
