You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the answer to the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
7

Output
4

Input
8

Output
5

Input
9

Output
5



-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != num // i:
                count += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables `num`, `count`, and `i` after the loop has executed.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).
    #- `count` is 0.
    #- `i` is 1.
    #
    #### Loop Analysis:
    #The loop runs as long as `i * i <= num`. Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is divisible by `i` and increments `count` accordingly. Specifically:
    #- If `num % i == 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1.
    #- If `i` is not equal to `num // i`, then `count` is incremented by 1 again (since both `i` and `num // i` are divisors).
    #
    #### Key Observations:
    #1. **Divisor Counting**: The loop counts the number of divisors of `num`. Each time `i` divides `num` without a remainder, `count` is incremented.
    #2. **Perfect Squares**: If `i` equals `num // i`, it means `num` is a perfect square, and this divisor is counted only once.
    #
    #### Final Iteration:
    #- The loop terminates when `i * i > num`. At this point, `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > num`.
    #- This implies that the last value of `i` is the smallest integer greater than \(\sqrt{\text{num}}\).
    #
    #### Final State:
    #- Since the loop terminates when `i * i > num`, `i` will be \(\lceil \sqrt{\text{num}} \rceil\).
    #- `count` will be the total number of divisors of `num`.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- `num` remains the same as its original value.
    #- `i` is \(\lceil \sqrt{\text{num}} \rceil\).
    #- `count` is the total number of divisors of `num`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #
    #**Output State: `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), `i` is \(\lceil \sqrt{\text{num}} \rceil\), and `count` is the total number of divisors of the original value of `num`.**
    return count
    #`count` is the total number of divisors of the original value of `num`, `i` is \(\lceil \sqrt{\text{num}} \rceil\), and `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
