Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\)
- `count` is 0
- `i` is 1

### While Loop Condition:
```
while i * i <= num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop continues as long as the condition `i * i <= num` is true. Let's break down what happens in the first iteration:

1. Initially, `i = 1`.
2. The condition `i * i <= num` becomes `1 * 1 <= num` or `1 <= num`.

Since the condition `1 <= num` is always true (as `num` is guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^9\)), the loop will execute at least once. 

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are necessary because the loop condition is already satisfied with the given initial values. The loop can proceed to the first iteration without any modifications to the state.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\); `count` is 0; `i` is 1**
