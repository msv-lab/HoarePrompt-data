`count` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `count` is unknown. The precondition that `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9; `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and `num` must be at least 9; `count` is increased by 1**
