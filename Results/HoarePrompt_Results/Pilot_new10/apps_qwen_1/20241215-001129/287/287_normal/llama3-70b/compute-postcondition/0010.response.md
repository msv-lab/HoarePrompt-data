`res` is initially -1 if it was originally 0 or 1 if originally 2. The code snippet increments `res` by 2. Therefore, if `res` was originally -1, it becomes -1 + 2 = 1. If `res` was originally 1, it becomes 1 + 2 = 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `res` is 1 if originally -1 or 3 if originally 1**
