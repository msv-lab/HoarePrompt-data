Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem description, the task is to find the number of different weights of the splits of \( n \). However, the program currently calculates the number of divisors of \( n \).

To solve the problem correctly, the program should generate all possible splits of \( n \) and then determine the unique weights of these splits. The current implementation only counts the divisors of \( n \), which does not address the requirement of finding different weights of splits.

Hereâ€™s why the program does not meet the requirements:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the number of divisors of \( n \) using a loop that iterates up to the square root of \( n \). This calculation is not related to finding the different weights of splits.
2. **Lack of Split Generation**: There is no logic to generate the splits of \( n \) and compute their weights.
3. **Output Mismatch**: The output of the program is the number of divisors of \( n \), whereas the expected output should be the number of different weights of the splits of \( n \).

To correct the program, you would need to implement logic to generate all valid splits of \( n \) and then compute their weights, ensuring that you count the unique weights correctly.
