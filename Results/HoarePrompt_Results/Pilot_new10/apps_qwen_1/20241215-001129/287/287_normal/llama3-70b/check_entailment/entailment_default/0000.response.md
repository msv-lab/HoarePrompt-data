Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem requires finding the number of different weights of splits of \( n \), where the weight of a split is defined as the number of elements equal to the first element. However, the code instead counts the number of divisors of \( n \).

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the input \( n = 7 \):

- The correct weights of splits of 7 are: 1, 2, 3, and 7. This is because:
  - Weight 1: \([7]\)
  - Weight 2: \([3, 3, 1]\)
  - Weight 3: \([2, 2, 2, 1]\)
  - Weight 7: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)

However, the code would incorrectly return 4, as it calculates the number of divisors of 7, which is 2 (1 and 7), and adds 2 more for the pairs of divisors (since 1*1 = 1 and 7*7 = 49, both are valid divisors but are counted twice in the range calculation).

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and should return False.
