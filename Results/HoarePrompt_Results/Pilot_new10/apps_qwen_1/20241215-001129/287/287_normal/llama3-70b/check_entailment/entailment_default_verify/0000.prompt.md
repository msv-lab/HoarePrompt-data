You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to count the number of different weights of splits for a given \( n \). However, it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program tries to count divisors of \( n \), which does not directly relate to the weights of splits.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the input \( n = 7 \):

- According to the problem description, the possible weights of splits for \( n = 7 \) are:
  - Weight 1: \([7]\)
  - Weight 2: \([3, 3, 1]\)
  - Weight 3: \([2, 2, 2, 1]\)
  - Weight 7: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)

There are 4 different weights, but the program incorrectly outputs 4 because it counts the number of divisors of \( n \) (which is also 4 for \( n = 7 \)) instead of counting the distinct weights of splits.

Another example to further illustrate the issue is \( n = 8 \):

- Possible weights of splits for \( n = 8 \) are:
  - Weight 1: \([8]\)
  - Weight 2: \([4, 4]\)
  - Weight 3: \([3, 3, 2]\)
  - Weight 4: \([2, 2, 2, 2]\)
  - Weight 8: \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)

There are 5 different weights, but the program incorrectly outputs 5, again due to counting divisors instead of distinct weights of splits.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution and should be marked as incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function reads an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)) and prints the number of divisors of \( n \). If \( n \) is a perfect square, one pair of divisors is subtracted to correct for double counting. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
