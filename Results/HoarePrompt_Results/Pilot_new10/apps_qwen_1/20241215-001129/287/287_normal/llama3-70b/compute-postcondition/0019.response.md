Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `res` is the number of divisors of `n` minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
- For each `i`, if `n % i == 0`, `res` is incremented by 2 because both `i` and `n // i` are divisors.
- If `i * i == n`, this means `n` is a perfect square, and we need to adjust `res` by subtracting 1 because we would have double-counted the divisor `i`.

After the loop completes, `res` will be the total count of divisors of `n` (each divisor pair counted twice, except for the middle one in case of a perfect square, hence subtracted once).

Thus, the final value of `res` is the number of divisors of `n` minus 1 if `n` is not a perfect square, or the number of divisors of `n` minus 2 if `n` is a perfect square.
