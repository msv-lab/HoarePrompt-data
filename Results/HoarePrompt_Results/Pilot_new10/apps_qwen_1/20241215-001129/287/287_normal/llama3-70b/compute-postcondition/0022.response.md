Let's analyze the provided annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function.

1. **Input**: The function takes no explicit input parameters, but it reads an integer `n` from the user via `input()`. The range of `n` is specified as \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).

2. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is read from the input and converted to an integer.
   - `res` is initialized to 0.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - For each `i`:
     - If `n` is divisible by `i` (`n % i == 0`), `res` is incremented by 2.
     - If `i * i` equals `n` (i.e., `i` is a perfect square divisor of `n`), `res` is decremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the value of `res` is printed.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code vs. Actual Code

- **Annotations vs. Code**:
  - The annotation states that `res` is the number of divisors of `n` minus 1.
  - However, the code actually counts pairs of divisors and subtracts one when a perfect square is encountered.

### Determining the Functionality

The function iterates over all integers from 1 to the square root of `n` to count the number of divisors of `n`. Each pair of divisors `(i, n // i)` contributes to the count, but if `n` is a perfect square, the middle divisor is counted twice, hence the subtraction of 1 to correct for this overcount.

### Potential Edge Cases

- **Perfect Squares**: When `n` is a perfect square (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, ...), the middle divisor is counted twice, leading to the subtraction of 1 to correct the overcount.
- **Non-Perfect Squares**: For non-perfect squares, each divisor is counted exactly once.

### Summary

The function reads an integer `n` from the user, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and calculates the number of divisors of `n`. It counts each divisor pair and subtracts 1 if `n` is a perfect square.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)) and prints the number of divisors of \( n \). If \( n \) is a perfect square, one pair of divisors is subtracted to correct for double counting.**
