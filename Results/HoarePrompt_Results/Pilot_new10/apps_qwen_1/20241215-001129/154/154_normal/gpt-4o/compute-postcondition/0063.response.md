Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `t` must be a non-empty list, `subtasks_solved` is 0 before the loop starts and will be incremented within the loop, and the remaining time is greater than or equal to the subtask time***
