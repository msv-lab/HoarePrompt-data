Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `t` must be a non-empty list, and `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The function performs these operations if and only if `remaining_time` is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`.***
