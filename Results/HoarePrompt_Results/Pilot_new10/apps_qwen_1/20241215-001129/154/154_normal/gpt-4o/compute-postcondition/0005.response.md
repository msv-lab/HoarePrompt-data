The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no loop or if statement was specified in the initial state, the value of `time_used` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, `t` is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `time_used` is `c * total_time_per_task`, and `max_points` is 0. The current value of `time_used` is greater than `M`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
