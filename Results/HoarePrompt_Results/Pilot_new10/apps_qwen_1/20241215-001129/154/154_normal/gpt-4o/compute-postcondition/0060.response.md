`remaining_time` is assigned the value `M - time_used`. The previous value of `remaining_time` is 0, and `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`. Therefore, the new value of `remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is \(\min(\text{subtasks\_solved}, (n - (\text{complete\_tasks} + 1)) * k)\), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points + \text{subtasks\_solved}`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)**
