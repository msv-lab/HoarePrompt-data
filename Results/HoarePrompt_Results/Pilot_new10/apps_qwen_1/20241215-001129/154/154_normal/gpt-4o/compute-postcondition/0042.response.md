Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `remaining_time` is reduced by `subtask_time`.
   - `subtasks_solved` is incremented by the number of subtasks that can be solved within `remaining_time`.
   - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to the same value as `subtasks_solved`.
   - `subtask_time` remains a valid element in the list `t`.
   - `max_points` remains unchanged.
   - `time_used` is increased by `subtask_time`.
   - `points` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for subtask_time in t:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop iterates over each `subtask_time` in the list `t`.
   - The loop can continue as long as there are elements in `t`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `subtask_time` is a variable that changes with each iteration and it must remain a valid element in the list `t`, we need to ensure that the next `subtask_time` is a valid element in `t`.
   - The states that change during the loop (like `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, `time_used`) are reset for the new iteration of the loop.
   - The `max_points` and `points` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

- `remaining_time` is reset (reduced by the previous `subtask_time` but needs to be recalculated).
- `subtasks_solved` is reset (incremented by the number of subtasks that can be solved within `remaining_time` but needs to be recalculated).
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is reset (set to the same value as `subtasks_solved` but needs to be recalculated).
- `subtask_time` changes to the next valid element in `t`.
- `time_used` is reset (increased by the previous `subtask_time` but needs to be recalculated).
- `max_points` remains unchanged.
- `points` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:

State: **`remaining_time` is reset, `subtasks_solved` is reset, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is reset, `subtask_time` is the next valid element in `t`, `time_used` is reset, `max_points` remains unchanged, `points` remains unchanged.**
