Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `remaining_time` is updated to `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.
  - If `remaining_time < subtask_time`, no changes are made to `remaining_time` and `subtasks_solved`.

### For Loop Statement
```python
for subtask_time in t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each `subtask_time` in the list `t`.
   - The state of `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is updated based on the current value of `subtask_time`.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each `subtask_time`, the following operations are performed:
     - `remaining_time` is updated as `remaining_time - (remaining_time // subtask_time) * subtask_time`.
     - `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `remaining_time // subtask_time`.
     - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to `remaining_time // subtask_time`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If `remaining_time < subtask_time` at any point, no changes are made to `remaining_time` and `subtasks_solved`.

### Determining the Next State
- To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `subtask_time` from the list `t` for the next iteration.

Let's assume the list `t` contains values like `[5, 10, 15]` and the current `subtask_time` being processed is the first one (i.e., 5).

#### Example Calculation:
- Suppose the current `subtask_time` is 5.
- If `remaining_time` is 20 before the loop starts, after processing `subtask_time = 5`, the new state will be:
  - `remaining_time` = 20 - (20 // 5) * 5 = 20 - 4 * 5 = 0
  - `subtasks_solved` = 20 // 5 = 4
  - `max_subtasks_for_this_task` = 4

- For the next iteration, the `subtask_time` will be the next value in the list `t`, which is 10.

### Final State Adjustment
- Since the loop is about to process the next `subtask_time` (10), the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.
- The new state will be based on the remaining `remaining_time` after processing the previous `subtask_time`.

### Final Answer
State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is 4, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 4, and the next `subtask_time` to process is 10.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next iteration with the updated values.
