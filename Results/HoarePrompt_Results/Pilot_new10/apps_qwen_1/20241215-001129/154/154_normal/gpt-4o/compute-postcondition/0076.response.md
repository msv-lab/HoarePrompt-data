The code `remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` updates the value of `remaining_time` by subtracting `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from it. Let's break down the variables:

- `remaining_time` is initially adjusted according to whether it is greater than or equal to the next `subtask_time` in the list `t`.
- `subtasks_solved` is updated to `subtasks_solved + (remaining_time // subtask_time)`.
- `subtask_time` remains the same.
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is calculated as `remaining_time // subtask_time`.
- `t` is a non-empty list.

The code modifies `remaining_time` by subtracting `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time` from it. Since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, the new value of `remaining_time` will be:

\[ \text{new\_remaining\_time} = \text{remaining\_time} - (\text{remaining\_time} // \text{subtask\_time}) \times \text{subtask\_time} \]

Since `remaining_time // subtask_time` is the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`, multiplying this by `subtask_time` gives us the largest multiple of `subtask_time` that is less than or equal to `remaining_time`. Subtracting this from `remaining_time` leaves us with the remainder when `remaining_time` is divided by `subtask_time`.

Therefore, the new value of `remaining_time` will be the remainder of the division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is the remainder of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is `subtasks_solved + (remaining_time // subtask_time)`, `subtask_time` remains the same, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `t` is a non-empty list**
