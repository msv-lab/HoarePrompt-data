`points` is assigned the value `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The value of `complete_tasks` is known, and it is multiplied by `(k + 1)` to assign the value to `points`. Other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `points`.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0 or the remaining time after covering all possible subtasks, `subtasks_solved` remains unchanged, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next element in the list `t`, `max_points` remains unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`**
