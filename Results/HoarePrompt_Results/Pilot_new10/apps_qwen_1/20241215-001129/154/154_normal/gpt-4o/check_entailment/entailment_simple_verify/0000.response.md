Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points Polycarp can earn within the given time limit \( M \). The logic implemented in the `func_1` function ensures that all possible scenarios are considered, including the cases where no tasks are completed, all tasks are completed, and intermediate subtasks are solved. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different stages, confirming that the program handles the input correctly and computes the result as expected. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
