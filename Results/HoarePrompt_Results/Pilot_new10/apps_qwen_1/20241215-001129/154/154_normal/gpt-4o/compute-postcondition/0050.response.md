`remaining_time` is decremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. The previous values of `remaining_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task`, and `subtask_time` are used in this calculation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is `remaining_time` - `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtask_time` is the next valid element in `t`, `time_used` is reset, `max_points` remains unchanged, `points` remains unchanged.**
