The code `remaining_time = M - time_used` calculates the remaining time by subtracting `time_used` from `M`. The values of `M` and `time_used` are known, while `n`, `k`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `complete_tasks`, and `points` are not directly affected by this line of code.

- `M` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
- `time_used` is calculated as `c * total_time_per_task`, where `c` is an unknown constant and `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`.

Therefore, the `remaining_time` is `M - (c * total_time_per_task)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2 × 10^9; `t` is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`; `time_used` is c * total_time_per_task; `max_points` is 0; `points` is complete_tasks * (k + 1); `remaining_time` is M - (c * total_time_per_task).**
