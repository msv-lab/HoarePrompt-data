The variable `subtasks_solved` is assigned the value `0`. This initializes `subtasks_solved` to 0 without changing any other variables. The initial conditions remain intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 45; `M` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2 × 10^9; `t` is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k; `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`; `time_used` is c * total_time_per_task; `max_points` is 0; `points` is complete_tasks * (k + 1); `remaining_time` is M - (c * total_time_per_task); `subtasks_solved` is 0.**
