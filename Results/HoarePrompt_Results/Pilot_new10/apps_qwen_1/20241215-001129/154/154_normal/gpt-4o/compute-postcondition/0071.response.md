`remaining_time` is decremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time`. The previous value of `remaining_time` is 0, and since `max_subtasks_for_this_task` and `subtask_time` are unchanged, the new value of `remaining_time` is `- (max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time)`. The states of the other variables (`subtasks_solved`, `subtask_time`, `t`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task`) are not affected.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is `- (max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time)`, `subtasks_solved` is increased by `remaining_time // subtask_time` from the previous iteration, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `t` is a non-empty list, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is unchanged**
