`subtasks_solved` is incremented by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. The value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_time` is an integer, `subtask_time` is an integer, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is an integer, `subtask_time` is an integer, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`; `subtasks_solved` is increased by `max_subtasks_for_this_task`**
