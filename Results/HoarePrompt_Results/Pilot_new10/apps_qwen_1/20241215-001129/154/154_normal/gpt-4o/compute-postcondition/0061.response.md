The code sets `subtasks_solved` to 0. This directly updates the value of `subtasks_solved`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

- `remaining_time` is initially `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task)`
- `subtasks_solved` is now 0 (it is set to 0 by the code)
- `max_subtasks_for_this_task` remains unchanged
- `subtask_time` remains unchanged
- `time_used` is initially `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`
- `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points + subtasks_solved`
- `points` is initially `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`

Since `subtasks_solved` is now 0, the value of `max_points` does not change because `points + subtasks_solved` would be `complete_tasks * (k + 1) + 0`, which is the same as the initial value of `points`.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is `M - (complete_tasks * total_time_per_task)`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`**
