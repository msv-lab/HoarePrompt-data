Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is reduced by `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by the number of subtasks that can be solved within `remaining_time`, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to the same value as `subtasks_solved`, `subtask_time` remains a valid element in the list `t`, `max_points` remains unchanged, `time_used` is increased by `subtask_time`, and `points` remains unchanged.***
