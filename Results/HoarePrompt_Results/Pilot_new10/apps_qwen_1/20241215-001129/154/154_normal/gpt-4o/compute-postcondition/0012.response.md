`max_subtasks_for_this_task` is assigned the value of `remaining_time // subtask_time`. Since `remaining_time` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`, the value of `max_subtasks_for_this_task` will be the integer division of `remaining_time` by `subtask_time`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is an integer, `subtask_time` is an integer, `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is `remaining_time // subtask_time`.**
