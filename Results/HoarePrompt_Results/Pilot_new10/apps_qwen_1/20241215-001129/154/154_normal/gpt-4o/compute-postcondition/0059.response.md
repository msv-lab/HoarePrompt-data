The code assigns `complete_tasks * (k + 1)` to `points`. This updates the value of `points` to `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_time` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is \(\min(\text{subtasks\_solved}, (n - (\text{complete\_tasks} + 1)) * k)\), `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is unchanged, `subtask_time` is unchanged, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `max_points` is the maximum of `max_points` and `points + \text{subtasks\_solved}`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)**
