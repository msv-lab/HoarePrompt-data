#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 45 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, M is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9, and t is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_points` is the maximum value of `points + subtasks_solved` obtained during the loop, `remaining_time` is the remaining time after the last iteration, `subtasks_solved` is the maximum number of subtasks solved under the constraints, `subtask_time` is the last `subtask_time` processed, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in the list `t`, `t` is the original list of subtask times, `complete_tasks` is `n`, `points` is `n * (k + 1)`.
    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points which is the maximum value of points + subtasks_solved obtained during the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer), `M` (a non-negative integer), and `t` (a list of positive integers). It calculates the maximum points one can achieve by completing tasks within a given time limit `M`. Points are earned based on the number of complete tasks and additional points for solving subtasks. The function returns the maximum value of points plus the number of subtasks solved.
