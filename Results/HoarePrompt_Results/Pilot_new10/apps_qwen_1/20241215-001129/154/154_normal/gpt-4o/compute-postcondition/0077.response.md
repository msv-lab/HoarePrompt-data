Postcondition: ***`remaining_time` is adjusted according to whether it is greater than or equal to the `subtask_time`. If `remaining_time` >= `subtask_time`, `remaining_time` is the remainder of `remaining_time` divided by `subtask_time`, `subtasks_solved` is incremented by `remaining_time // subtask_time`, `subtask_time` remains the same, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task` is set to `remaining_time // subtask_time`. If `remaining_time` < `subtask_time`, no changes are made to `remaining_time`, `subtasks_solved`, `subtask_time`, and `max_subtasks_for_this_task`. `t` is a non-empty list.***
