Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution described in the problem statement. The state transitions and the final calculation steps align with the logic needed to maximize the points Polycarp can earn. The original assessment correctly identified the program as accurate based on the problem description and the provided implementation details.
