`t.sort()` sorts the list `t` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged. Since the initial state of `t` is a list of `k` integers obtained from the input, after sorting, `t` will be a list of those same integers in sorted order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is an integer between 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order.**
