Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i-1]`, then `dp[1][j]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][j]` remains 0.***
