Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\), and `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Additionally, the current value of `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`***
