Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `M` is a non-negative integer
- `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order
- `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) where each element is the maximum value achievable by selecting elements from the list `t` up to the current index `i - 1` such that the sum does not exceed the current value of `j`.

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be within the range of `1` to `k + 1`, but it must be incremented from `k + 1` to `k + 2`.

### Adjusting States
- **i**: Since the loop condition requires `i` to be in the range `[1, k + 1]`, and currently `i` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to `k + 2`.
- **k**: The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is a constant defined before the loop starts.
- **M**: The value of `M` remains unchanged as it is also a constant defined before the loop starts.
- **t**: The list `t` remains unchanged as it is defined before the loop starts.
- **dp**: The `dp` table remains unchanged as the loop body is not provided, and no modifications to the `dp` table are mentioned.

### Final State
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) where each element is the maximum value achievable by selecting elements from the list `t` up to the current index `i - 1` such that the sum does not exceed the current value of `j`.**

This ensures that the loop condition is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
