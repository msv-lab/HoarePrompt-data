Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `i` is `k + 2`.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `M` is a non-negative integer.
   - `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order.
   - `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\).
   - `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value achievable by selecting elements from the list `t` up to the current index `i - 1` such that the sum does not exceed the current value of `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `M + 1`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `M + 1`. Therefore, `j` must be within this range for the loop to execute.
   - There are no direct dependencies between `i`, `k`, `M`, `t`, or `dp` and the loop starting condition for `j`. However, the values of these variables will affect the computations inside the loop.

4. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop starts with `j` ranging from 1 to `M + 1`, we only need to ensure that `j` is within this range for the loop to execute. No adjustment is needed for the other variables as they don't directly impact the loop execution.

**State:**
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\), and `j` must be in the range [1, M + 1]**
