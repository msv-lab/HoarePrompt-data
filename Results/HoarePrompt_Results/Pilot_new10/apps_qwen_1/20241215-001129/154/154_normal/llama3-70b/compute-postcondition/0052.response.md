Let's break down the given annotated code and return postconditions step by step to understand the functionality of the function:

1. **Input Parameters and Initial State**:
   - The function reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( M \) from input where \( 1 \leq n \leq 45 \), \( 1 \leq k \leq 45 \), and \( 0 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^9 \).
   - It then reads a list of \( k \) integers \( t_j \) (where \( 1 \leq t_j \leq 1000000 \)) and sorts this list.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - A 2D list `dp` is initialized with dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) where each element `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value achievable by selecting elements from the list `t` up to the current index `i - 1` such that the sum does not exceed the current value of `j`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The function iterates over the list `t` and updates the `dp` table based on the condition that either we take the current element `t[i-1]` or skip it.
   - Specifically, for each element in `t`, it checks if including the current element `t[i-1]` in the sum (up to `j - t[i-1]`) results in a higher value than the previous sum up to `j - 1`.

4. **Final Calculation and Output**:
   - After filling the `dp` table, the function calculates the sum of the values in the last row of `dp` up to index `M`.
   - It also counts the number of times the value in the last row equals the current index `i`, which helps in calculating the total number of valid selections.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of these two values.

**Potential Edge Cases**:
- If \( M = 0 \), the maximum value achievable is always 0 because no elements can be selected.
- If \( k = 0 \), there are no elements in `t`, so the maximum value achievable is 0.

**Summary**:
The function processes the input parameters \( n \), \( k \), and \( M \) along with a sorted list of integers \( t \). It uses dynamic programming to find the maximum value that can be achieved by selecting a subset of elements from \( t \) such that their sum does not exceed \( M \). It then returns the sum of the maximum value and the count of valid selections.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( M \), a sorted list of integers \( t \), and computes the sum of the maximum value achievable by selecting a subset of elements from \( t \) such that their sum does not exceed \( M \), and the count of valid selections, and prints the result.**
