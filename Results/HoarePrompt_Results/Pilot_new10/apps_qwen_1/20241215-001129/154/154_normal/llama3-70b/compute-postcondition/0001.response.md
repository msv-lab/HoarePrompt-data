`t` is assigned the value of a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, ...)`. The original values of `n`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged, but `t` now holds the list of integers. The input for `t` is specified to contain `k` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 45, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is an integer between 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers obtained from the input.**
