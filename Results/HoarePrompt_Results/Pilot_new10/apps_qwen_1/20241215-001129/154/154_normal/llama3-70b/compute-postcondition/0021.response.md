The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i][j - 1]`. This means the value of `dp[i][j]` is now equal to the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\), and `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.**
