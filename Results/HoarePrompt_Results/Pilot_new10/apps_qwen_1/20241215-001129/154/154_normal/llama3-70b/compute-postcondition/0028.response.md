Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\), and `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i][j], dp[k + 1][j - t[k]] + 1)` for each relevant `j` if `j >= t[i - 1]` holds true. If `j < t[i - 1]`, `dp[i][j]` remains unchanged as `dp[i][j - 1]` if `j` is `M + 1`.***
