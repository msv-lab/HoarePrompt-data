Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `k + 2`
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `M` is at least 1
- `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order
- `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\)
- `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` remains equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `M + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 1` and goes up to `M + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `M`.

2. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `M + 1`.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `i` remains `k + 2` because the loop does not affect `i`.
   - `k`, `M`, `t`, and `dp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the state should be adjusted such that:
- `j` is `M + 1`
- All other variables (`total`, `i`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `dp`) remain unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\), and `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1)` if `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` remains equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, where `j` is `M + 1`.**
