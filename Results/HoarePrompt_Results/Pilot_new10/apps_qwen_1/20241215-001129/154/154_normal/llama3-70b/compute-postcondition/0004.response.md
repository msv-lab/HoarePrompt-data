Let's break down the given information and the for loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 45.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 45.
- `M` is an integer between 0 and \(2 \times 10^9\).
- `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order.
- `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to 0.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = k`. To ensure the loop can execute:

1. **Value of `i`**: The loop starts at `i = 1` and ends at `i = k`. Since `i` is the loop variable, we need to ensure `i` starts at 1.
2. **Value of `k`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` must be at least 1 to allow the loop to run.

### State Adjustment:
- We need to ensure that `i` starts at 1.
- We need to ensure that `k` is at least 1.

Given that `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, and since `i` starts at 1, the minimum value of `k` is already covered by the loop's range starting from 1.

### Final State:
The initial state does not require any additional adjustments other than ensuring `i` starts at 1. However, to make sure the loop runs correctly, we need to explicitly mention that `k` should be at least 1.

State: **`total` is 0 (or any other value, since it's not relevant here), `i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `M` is an integer between 0 and \(2 \times 10^9\), `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to 0**
