Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` is an integer between 1 and 45, `M` is an integer between 0 and 2Â·10^9, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) where each element `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value achievable by selecting elements from the list `t` up to the current index `i - 1` such that the sum does not exceed the current value of `j`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`.
   - The inner loop runs from `1` to `M + 1`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initially, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to `0`.
   - `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `k + 1`.
   - `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `M + 1`.

3. **Update Rule:**
   - For each iteration, `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the previous row `dp[i][j-1]` and the value of `t[i-1]`.
   - Specifically, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i][j-1]` initially.
   - If `j` is greater than or equal to `t[i-1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i][j-1]` and `dp[i-1][j-t[i-1]] + 1`.

4. **Final State:**
   - After all iterations of the loop, `i` will reach `k + 1`.
   - The values in `dp` will represent the optimal solutions for the subproblems defined by the range `[0, M]` and the list `t`.

5. **Dependent Variables:**
   - The variables `i`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `dp` remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing. Specifically, `i` will be `k + 1`, `k` and `M` retain their original values, `t` remains a sorted list of `k` integers, and `dp` contains the computed optimal values.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes is as stated above.
