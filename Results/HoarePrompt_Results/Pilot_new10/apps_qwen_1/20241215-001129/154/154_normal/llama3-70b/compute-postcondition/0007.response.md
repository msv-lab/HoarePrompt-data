Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `M` is at least 1, `t` is a list of `k` integers in sorted order, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions \((k + 1) \times (M + 1)\) with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1][j]` equals `dp[1][j - 1]` for each \( j \) from 0 to \( M \), and the current value of \( j \) is greater than or equal to \( t[i - 1] \)**
