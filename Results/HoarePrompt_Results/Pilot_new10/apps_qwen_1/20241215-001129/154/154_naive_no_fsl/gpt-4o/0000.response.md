Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the input and initializes variables correctly.
2. **Total Time Calculation**: The total time required to complete one task is calculated correctly.
3. **Loop Through Complete Tasks**: The program iterates through the possible number of complete tasks (from 0 to `n`), calculating the time used and the points earned.
4. **Remaining Time and Subtasks**: For each combination of complete tasks, the program calculates how many additional subtasks can be completed with the remaining time, ensuring not to exceed the limit set by the number of incomplete tasks.
5. **Max Points Calculation**: The program updates the maximum points whenever a better combination of complete and partial tasks is found.

Given the logic and the way the program handles the constraints, it should work correctly for all potential cases within the given limits. There doesn't appear to be any missing edge cases or logical flaws based on the problem description and the provided examples.
