`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `n` is now an integer representing the length of the string `s`. The string `s` itself is not directly manipulated by this line of code, so its state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string of length n consisting of '-' and '+' characters.**
