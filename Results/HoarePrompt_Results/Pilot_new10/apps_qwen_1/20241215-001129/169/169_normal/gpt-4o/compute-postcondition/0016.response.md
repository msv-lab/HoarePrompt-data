To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the logic of the for loop:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`.
   - `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of '-' and '+' characters.
   - `stones` is either 2 if `operation` was '-', or 0 if `operation` was '+'.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for operation in s:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - The loop variable `operation` takes the value of each character in `s` one by one.
   - The value of `stones` changes based on the current `operation`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - After the previous iteration, `s` is a string of length `n-1` and `operation` is the current character being processed.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character left in `s` to process.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - Since we are moving to the next character in the string `s`, `operation` will now be the next character in `s`.
   - The length of the string `s` remains the same, so `n` still represents the length of `s` (which is `len(s) + 1`).
   - `stones` will be updated based on the new `operation`.

Given these points, we need to update the state such that the loop can continue iterating:

- `s` should be the original string minus the last processed character.
- `operation` should be the next character in `s`.
- `n` remains the same as it is derived from the length of `s`.
- `stones` will be updated to reflect the current `operation`.

Therefore, the updated state before the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of '-' and '+' characters, where `operation` is the next character in `s`, and `stones` is either 2 if `operation` is '-', or 0 if `operation` is '+'**.
