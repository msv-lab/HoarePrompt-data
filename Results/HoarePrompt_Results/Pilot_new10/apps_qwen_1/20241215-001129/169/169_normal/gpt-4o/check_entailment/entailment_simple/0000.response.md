Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input as specified. It first reads an integer `n` which represents the number of operations, followed by a string `s` of length `n` containing only '-' and '+' characters.

2. **Operation Execution**: The program initializes a variable `stones` to zero. It then iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each '+', it increments the `stones` counter. For each '-', it decrements the `stones` counter but ensures it does not go below zero, as per the problem statement which states the pile cannot be empty before a subtraction operation.

3. **Output**: After processing all operations, the program prints the value of `stones`, which represents the minimal possible number of stones left in the pile after performing the operations.

4. **Logic Verification**: 
   - If all operations are '+', the minimal number of stones left is equal to the number of '+' operations.
   - If there are '-' operations, the minimal number of stones left would be the net increase in stones (i.e., number of '+' operations minus the number of '-' operations), ensuring the pile never goes empty.

Given that the program correctly handles all edge cases (such as ensuring the pile doesn't go empty before subtracting a stone), and follows the exact logic required by the problem description, the program is correct.
