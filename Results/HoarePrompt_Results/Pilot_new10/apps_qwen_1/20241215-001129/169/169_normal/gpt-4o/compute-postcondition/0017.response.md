The code `stones += 1` increments the value of `stones` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `stones` is either 2 (if `operation` is '-') or 0 (if `operation` is '+'). After the increment, `stones` will be 3 if it was 2, or 1 if it was 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of '-' and '+' characters, `stones` is either 3 if `operation` is '-' or 1 if `operation` is '+'**
