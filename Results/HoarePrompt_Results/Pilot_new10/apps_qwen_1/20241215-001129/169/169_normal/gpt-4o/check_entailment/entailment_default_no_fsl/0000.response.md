Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the operations, updating the number of stones in the pile appropriately. If the operation is '+', it increments the stone count, and if it is '-', it decrements the stone count but ensures the count does not go below zero. This logic guarantees that the pile never becomes empty during the '-' operations, as specified in the problem description. The final count of stones after processing all operations gives the minimal possible number of stones in the pile, which matches the required output. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case described in the problem.
