The annotated code indicates that the function takes no parameters and instead uses `input()` to get values for `n` and `s`. Here, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols. The function then counts the number of "-" and "+" symbols in `s`, compares their counts, and prints either `0` or `plus_count - minus_count` based on which count is larger.

Let's break it down:

1. The function reads an integer `n` from input and ensures it is within the range 1 to 100.
2. It reads a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols.
3. It counts the number of "-" and "+" symbols in the string `s`.
4. If the count of "-" symbols (`minus_count`) is greater than the count of "+" symbols (`plus_count`), it prints `0`.
5. Otherwise, it prints the difference `plus_count - minus_count`.

The annotations suggest that the function simply counts the number of "+" symbols and returns this count. However, the actual code includes a comparison and prints `0` if the number of "-" symbols is greater than the number of "+" symbols.

Thus, the actual functionality of the function is to process a string `s` of length `n`, count the number of "+" symbols, and return this count unless the number of "-" symbols is greater than the number of "+" symbols, in which case it returns `0`.

Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` of length `n`, counts the number of "+" symbols, and prints `0` if the number of "-" symbols is greater than the number of "+" symbols, otherwise it prints the count of "+" symbols.**
