`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which converts the input to an integer. The value of `s` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: $n$ is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and $s$ is a string of length $n$ consisting of "-" and "+" symbols.
