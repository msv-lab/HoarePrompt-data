Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the operations. Specifically:

1. The code simply counts the number of '-' and '+' symbols in the string `s` and checks if the number of '-' is greater than the number of '+'. If so, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-'.

2. This logic does not account for the requirement that the pile must remain non-empty before each operation of taking a stone from the pile. The code fails to ensure that the number of stones in the pile is sufficient to perform all the 'take' operations.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- For the input "----", the code will print `0`, but the correct minimal number of stones initially should be `4` (since Vasya needs 4 stones to perform 4 'take' operations without the pile becoming empty).
- For the input "+--+", the code will print `0`, but the correct minimal number of stones initially should be `3` (since Vasya needs 3 stones to perform 2 'take' operations without the pile becoming empty).

Thus, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases and hence the correctness is **False**.
