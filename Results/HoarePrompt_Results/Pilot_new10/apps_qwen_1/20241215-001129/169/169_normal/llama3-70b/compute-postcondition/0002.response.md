The code counts the number of '-' symbols in the string `s`. The variable `minus_count` is assigned the value of this count. The initial state of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols. After executing the code, `minus_count` will hold the count of '-' symbols in `s`, while `n` and `s` retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "-" and "+" symbols, `minus_count` is the count of '-' symbols in `s`**
