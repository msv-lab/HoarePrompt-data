Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the operations, updating the number of stones in the pile accordingly. The program ensures that the number of stones is never negative by using `max(0, stones - 1)` when a stone is taken. This approach guarantees that the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after all operations is calculated correctly. Since the program handles all cases as described and the examples provided also work correctly, the program is correct.
