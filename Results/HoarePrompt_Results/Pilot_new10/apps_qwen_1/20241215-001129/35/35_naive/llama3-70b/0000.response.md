Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake. Specifically, the program logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the distribution of cake pieces adheres to the requirement that no plate contains pieces of both cakes.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = 3`, `b = 7`
- Expected output: The maximum \( x \) should be 1, since we can distribute the cakes such that 3 plates get 1 piece from the first cake and 2 plates get 1 piece from the second cake.

However, the current implementation of the program will fail to correctly determine this.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program initializes `x` as the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It then enters a loop where it decrements `x` until it finds a value that satisfies the condition `a >= x` and `b >= x` and `a - x + (b - x) >= x`.

For the example above (`n = 5`, `a = 3`, `b = 7`):

- Initially, `x = 3` (since `min(5, 3, 7) = 3`).
- The loop fails to decrement `x` further because the condition `a - x + (b - x) >= x` does not hold for `x = 3`.

This means the program incorrectly outputs `3` instead of `1`, which is not the correct solution.

### Correct Solution:
A correct approach would involve distributing the pieces of each cake separately and ensuring that the minimum number of pieces per plate is maximized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Calculate the maximum x such that each plate gets at least x pieces of cake
    x = min(a // n, b // n)
    
    # Check if it is possible to distribute the remaining pieces
    if a % n > 0 and b % n > 0:
        x += 1
    
    print(x)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the distribution adheres to the problem constraints and calculates the correct value of \( x \).
