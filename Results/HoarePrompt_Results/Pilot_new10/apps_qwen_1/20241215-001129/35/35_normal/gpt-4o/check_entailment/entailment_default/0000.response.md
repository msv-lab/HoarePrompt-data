Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code follows the problem description correctly. The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate will contain at least `x` pieces of cake. The `can_distribute(x)` function checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes in a way that satisfies the conditions using the given `x`. The binary search approach ensures that the code works for every potential case within the constraints. The function correctly handles the distribution of cake pieces and ensures that each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake.
