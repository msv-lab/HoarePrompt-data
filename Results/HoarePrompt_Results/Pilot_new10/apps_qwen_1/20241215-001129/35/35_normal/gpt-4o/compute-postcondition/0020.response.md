The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. These parameters are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). The function returns `low - 1`, where `low` is the smallest integer such that `can_distribute(low)` is True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, and return `low - 1`, where `low` is the smallest integer satisfying the condition `can_distribute(low)` being True.
