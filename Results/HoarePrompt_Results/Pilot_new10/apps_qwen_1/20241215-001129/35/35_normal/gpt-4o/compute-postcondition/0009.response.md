The code snippet updates the value of `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down. Given the initial conditions:
- `low` is 1
- `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\)
- `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\)

We can calculate the new value of `mid` using the updated formula.

Let's denote \(\min(a, b)\) as `min_ab` for simplicity. The initial value of `mid` is given as \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).

The new value of `mid` is calculated as:
\[ \text{mid} = \left( \text{low} + \text{high} \right) // 2 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{mid} = \left( 1 + (\min(a, b) + 1) \right) // 2 \]
\[ \text{mid} = \left( 2 + \min(a, b) \right) // 2 \]

Since \(\text{mid}\) was initially \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\), we can compare the two expressions to confirm consistency. Let's denote the initial mid as `init_mid`:
\[ \text{init\_mid} = (\min(a, b) + 2) // 2 \]
\[ \text{new\_mid} = \left( 2 + \min(a, b) \right) // 2 \]

These two expressions are equivalent because they both represent the integer division of \(\min(a, b) + 2\) by 2. Thus, the value of `mid` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \); `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq a \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq b \leq 100 \); `low` is 1; `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\); `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\)**
