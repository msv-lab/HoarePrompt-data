Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the binary search approach to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake. The `func_1` function uses binary search to find the smallest integer \( low - 1 \) such that `can_distribute(low)` is `True`. The `can_distribute(x)` function checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes in a way that each plate has at least \( x \) pieces of cake. Given the constraints and the logic used, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly as described in the problem statement.
