Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\); `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 100\); `low` is 1; `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\); `mid` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\). If `can_distribute(mid)` is true, then `low` is \(\min(a, b) + 3\) and `high` is \(\min(a, b) + 1\). Otherwise, `can_distribute(mid)` returns False and `high` is \((\min(a, b) + 2) // 2\).***
