Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers, both greater than or equal to `x`. If the sum of `(a - x)` and `(b - x)` is greater than or equal to `x`, then no changes are made to `a` and `b`. Since there is no else part, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state where they are both greater than or equal to `x`.***
