The code `break` does not affect any variables but breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no loops or if statements are mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is an integer greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `(a - x)` and `(b - x)` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
