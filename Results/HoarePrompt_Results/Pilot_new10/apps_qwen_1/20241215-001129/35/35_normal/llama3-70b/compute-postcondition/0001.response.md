The code assigns the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b` to `x`. Given that `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100` and `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, the value of `x` will be the smallest of these three numbers. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b`; `n` is an integer between 2 and a + b inclusive, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
