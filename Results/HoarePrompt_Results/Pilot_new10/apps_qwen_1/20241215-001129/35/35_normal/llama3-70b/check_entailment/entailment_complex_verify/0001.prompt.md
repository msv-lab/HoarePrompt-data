You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and (a - x + (b - x) >= x):
            break
        x -= 1
    print(x)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, consider the input `n=4`, `a=3`, `b=5`. According to the problem description, we need to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate (`x`), ensuring that each plate has at least `x` pieces and no plate has pieces from both cakes. 

However, the program attempts to find the minimum value among `n`, `a`, and `b` and then iteratively checks if distributing `x` pieces of each cake to the plates satisfies the conditions. For the input `n=4`, `a=3`, `b=5`, the program will output `1` because it checks `x=1` and finds that it can distribute the pieces as `[3, 0, 0, 1]` for the first cake and `[1, 1, 1, 2]` for the second cake, which does not satisfy the condition that each plate must have at least one piece of each cake. 

A correct solution would need to ensure that the distribution allows for each plate to have at least one piece from each cake, which this program fails to enforce. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case and others where the distribution cannot meet the specified conditions.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
def func():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    x = min(n, a, b)
    while True:
        if a >= x and b >= x and a - x + (b - x) >= x:
            break
        
        x -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'x' is 0, 'a' is greater than or equal to 'x', 'b' is greater than or equal to 'x', 'n' is within the range [2, a+b] inclusive, and the condition \(a \geq x\) and \(b \geq x\) and \((a - x + (b - x)) \geq x\) holds.
    print(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the user, and returns the largest integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `a - x + (b - x) >= x`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
