The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans` without changing its value. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`; `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`; `ans` is updated based on the given rules; `print(ans)` is executed.**
