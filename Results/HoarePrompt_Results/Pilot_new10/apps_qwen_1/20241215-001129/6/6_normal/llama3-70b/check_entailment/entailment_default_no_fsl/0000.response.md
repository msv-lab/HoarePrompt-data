Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not account for the operation of closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor, which is a crucial part of the problem. The code only considers shifting the cursor and does not implement the functionality to close tabs, leading to incorrect results in many scenarios.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 3 2 4
```

The expected output is 5, as mentioned in the example. However, the provided code will not produce this result because it does not include the logic to close tabs. Instead, it only shifts the cursor, which is insufficient to solve the problem as stated.

To fix this, the code needs to include logic to handle the operations of closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor, in addition to shifting the cursor.
