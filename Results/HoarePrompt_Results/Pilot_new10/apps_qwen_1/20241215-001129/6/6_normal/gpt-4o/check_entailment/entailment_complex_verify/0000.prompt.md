You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
        print(close_both_sides)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where the cursor is not optimally positioned relative to the segment [l, r]. 

Consider the following example:
- Input: `6 6 2 4`

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would involve moving the cursor to the leftmost tab in the segment [2, 4], which is tab 2, and then closing all tabs to the right of it. However, the current implementation does not account for such a strategy:

1. The cursor is initially at tab 6.
2. The program calculates the distances to the boundaries of the segment: `move_to_l = abs(6 - 2) = 4` and `move_to_r = abs(6 - 4) = 2`.
3. It then computes `close_both_sides = min(4 + (4 - 2 + 2), 2 + (4 - 2 + 2)) = min(8, 6) = 6`.

This result suggests that Luba needs 6 seconds to close all tabs outside the segment [2, 4], but the optimal solution involves moving the cursor to tab 2 (1 second) and then closing all tabs to the right of it (3 seconds), totaling 4 seconds.

Therefore, the program does not always provide the minimum number of seconds required, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, pos, l, r are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if (l == 1 and r == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        if (l == 1) :
            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
        else :
            if (r == n) :
                print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
            else :
                move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
                move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
                close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
                print(close_both_sides)
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` with `r != n`. If `r == n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `close_both_sides` is defined as `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, and `close_both_sides` is printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `r` is an integer between `l` and `n` (excluding 1 and `n`). If `l == 1`, the output is `abs(pos - r) + 1`. Otherwise, if `r == n`, the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `close_both_sides` is defined as `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, and `close_both_sides` is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`. After the execution of the if-else block, if `l == 1` and `r == n`, the console displays `0`. Otherwise, if `l == 1`, the console displays `abs(pos - r) + 1`. If `r == n`, the console displays `abs(pos - l) + 1`. Otherwise, `close_both_sides` is defined as the minimum of `abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2)` and `abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2)`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, and `close_both_sides` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n. It prints the minimum number of moves required for `pos` to reach either `l` or `r`. Specifically:
- If `l == 1` and `r == n`, it prints `0`.
- If `l == 1`, it prints `abs(pos - r) + 1`.
- If `r == n`, it prints `abs(pos - l) + 1`.
- Otherwise, it calculates `close_both_sides` as the minimum of `abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2)` and `abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2)` and prints this value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
