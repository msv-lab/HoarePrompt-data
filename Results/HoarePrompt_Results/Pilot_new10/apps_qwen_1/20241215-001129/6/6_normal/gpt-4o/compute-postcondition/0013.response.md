The code snippet prints the value of `close_both_sides`. The value of `close_both_sides` is determined by the formula `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`. Since the print statement executes and no other variables are modified, the value of `close_both_sides` is printed, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`, `r != n`, `close_both_sides` is `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, `move_to_r` is `abs(pos - r)`, `move_to_l` is `abs(pos - l)`, `close_both_sides` is printed**
