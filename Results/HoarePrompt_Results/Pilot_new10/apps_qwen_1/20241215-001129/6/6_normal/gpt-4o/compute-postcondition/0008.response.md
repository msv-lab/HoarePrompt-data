The code `print(abs(pos - l) + 1)` calculates the absolute difference between `pos` and `l` and adds 1 to it. Given the conditions in the initial state:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `l` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `r` is an integer between `l` and `n`.
- `l` is not equal to 1.
- `r` is equal to `n`.

Since `r` is equal to `n` and `l` is between 1 and `n`, `l` can be any value from 2 to `n-1`. The value of `pos` can be any value from 1 to `n`. The code will print `abs(pos - l) + 1`, but it does not affect the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, or `r`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `pos` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `l` is an integer between 1 and `n` with `l` not equal to 1, `r` is equal to `n`, and the output is `abs(pos - l) + 1`.**
