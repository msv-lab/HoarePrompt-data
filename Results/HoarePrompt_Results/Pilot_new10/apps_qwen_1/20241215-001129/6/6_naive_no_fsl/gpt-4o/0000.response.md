Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Consider the following input:

Input:
```
6 4 3 5
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- Initially, the cursor is at position 4.
- Luba can move the cursor to position 3 (1 second).
- Then, Luba can close all tabs to the left of position 3 (1 second).
- Finally, Luba can move the cursor to position 5 and then close all tabs to the right of position 5 (1 second).

However, the program outputs `5` because it calculates the minimum moves as:
- Moving to position 3 (1 second).
- Closing all tabs to the left of position 3 (1 second).
- Moving to position 4 (1 second).
- Moving to position 5 (1 second).
- Closing all tabs to the right of position 5 (1 second).

This shows that the program overestimates the number of moves required, thus it is incorrect for this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
