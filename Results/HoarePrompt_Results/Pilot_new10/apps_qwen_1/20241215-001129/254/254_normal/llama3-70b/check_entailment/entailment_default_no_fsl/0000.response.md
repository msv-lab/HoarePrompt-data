Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using the least common multiple (LCM) of the three given intervals, but it uses a flawed approach to calculate the LCM. The formula used in the code is incorrect for finding the LCM of three numbers. Specifically, the line `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))` does not correctly compute the LCM. Instead, the LCM of three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) should be computed as:

\[ \text{lcm}(a, b, c) = \frac{\text{lcm}(\text{lcm}(a, b), c)}{1} \]

Additionally, the function `func_1` calculates the GCD, not the LCM. Therefore, the program cannot correctly determine whether it is possible to light up at least one garland every second after turning them on.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 2 3`

Using the correct approach, we can see that it is possible to light up at least one garland every second after turning them on. For example, turning on the garlands at seconds 1, 2, and 1 will achieve this.

However, the provided code will incorrectly output 'NO' for this case because the LCM calculation is wrong.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
