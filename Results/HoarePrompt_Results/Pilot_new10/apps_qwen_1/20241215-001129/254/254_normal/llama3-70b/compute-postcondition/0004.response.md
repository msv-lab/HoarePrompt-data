Let's break down the given example step by step:

1. **Initial Condition at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is `b`'s original value.
   - `b` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `b` is non-zero (`while b:`).

3. **Current State:**
   - Since `b` is currently 0, the condition `b` is false, meaning the loop will not execute another iteration with the current state.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To make the loop execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `b` is something other than 0.

5. **Final State:**
   - Given that `a` is `b`'s original value, we need to ensure `b` is non-zero for the loop to execute again. However, since the specific original value of `b` is not provided in the problem statement, we will denote it as `original_b`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
**`a` is `b`'s original value, `b` must be non-zero**.

State: **`a` is `b`'s original value, `b` must be non-zero**
