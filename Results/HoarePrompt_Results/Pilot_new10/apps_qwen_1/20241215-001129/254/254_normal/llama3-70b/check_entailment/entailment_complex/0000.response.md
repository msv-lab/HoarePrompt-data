Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used to determine whether it is possible to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit every second after they are turned on is flawed. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires determining if it is possible to find three times \(x_1, x_2,\) and \(x_3\) such that at least one garland is lit every second starting from the latest of these times. The key here is to ensure coverage of every second by at least one of the three intervals.

2. **Current Approach**: The program calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the three input intervals (`k1`, `k2`, `k3`) using a simplified formula involving the GCD (using the `func_1` function). However, this approach is not sufficient to guarantee that the intervals will cover every second.

3. **Flaw in Logic**:
   - The LCM calculation alone does not account for the starting points (`x_1`, `x_2`, `x_3`). Simply knowing the LCM tells us the periodicity but not the exact alignment with the starting points.
   - Even if the LCM covers all multiples of the individual intervals, it does not ensure that the starting points can achieve the required coverage.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `(4, 2, 3)`. The LCM of 4, 2, and 3 is 12. While 12 covers every multiple of the individual intervals, it does not ensure that there is always at least one interval lit every second starting from any of the possible start times. For example, if we start the first garland at second 1, the second at second 2, and the third at second 3, there will be gaps between seconds 5 and 6, 11 and 12, etc.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct solution would involve checking if the union of the intervals covers every second starting from the maximum of the start times. One approach could be to use the properties of intervals and their overlaps to ensure complete coverage.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not correctly determine if it is possible to light at least one garland every second. Therefore, the program is incorrect and should be marked as `False`.
