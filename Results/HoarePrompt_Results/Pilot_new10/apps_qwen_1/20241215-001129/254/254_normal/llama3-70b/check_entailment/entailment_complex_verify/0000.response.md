Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code uses `func_1` to calculate the GCD, not the LCM. Even though the annotated version correctly describes the behavior of `func_1` as calculating the GCD, the overall logic of the program is still flawed because it incorrectly uses the product of GCDs to compute the LCM. As a result, the program cannot correctly determine whether it is possible to light up at least one garland every second after switching them on. The annotated version confirms that the original assessment was correct in identifying the flaw in the LCM calculation.
