According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a`, `b`, and the third input integer (let's call it `c`) are integers such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq 1500\) for \(i \in \{1, 2, 3\}\).

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `b` to be non-zero.

State: **`a` is an integer, `b` must be non-zero, and `c` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k_i \leq 1500\) for \(i \in \{1, 2, 3\}\)**
