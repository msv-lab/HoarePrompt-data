Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the calculation of the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))` is incorrect. This formula assumes that the GCD function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor correctly, but it does not handle the case where the LCM needs to be calculated properly for the given `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the chosen initial times (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`) allow at least one garland to be lit every second after they are turned on. The provided code does not address this requirement effectively.

A correct approach would involve checking if the LCM of any two of the intervals plus one covers all seconds. However, the current implementation does not achieve this. For instance, consider the input `4 2 3`. The provided code incorrectly returns 'YES', which is not correct because there is no way to turn on the garlands at times such that they are lit every second after being turned on.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the Correctness is **False**.
