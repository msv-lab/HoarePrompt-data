You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if gcd_all == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals is 1. If the GCD is 1, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to choose moments of time to switch on the garlands such that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This approach works because if the GCD of the three time intervals is 1, then there exists a set of initial times \(x_1\), \(x_2\), and \(x_3\) such that the garlands will be lit every second starting from the maximum of these times. This is due to the fact that any linear combination of coprime numbers (numbers with GCD 1) can generate all positive integers.

To verify this, let's consider the examples provided:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: \(k_1 = 2\), \(k_2 = 2\), \(k_3 = 3\)
   - GCD calculation:
     \[
     \text{gcd}(2, 2) = 2 \\
     \text{gcd}(2, 3) = 1
     \]
   - Since the GCD is 1, the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because we can choose \(x_1 = 1\), \(x_2 = 2\), \(x_3 = 1\) (as explained in the problem note).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: \(k_1 = 4\), \(k_2 = 2\), \(k_3 = 3\)
   - GCD calculation:
     \[
     \text{gcd}(4, 2) = 2 \\
     \text{gcd}(2, 3) = 1
     \]
   - Since the GCD is 1, the program prints 'YES'. However, upon further analysis, this is incorrect because no matter how we choose the initial times, there will always be gaps in lighting. For instance, if we choose \(x_1 = 1\), \(x_2 = 2\), and \(x_3 = 1\), the sequence of lit seconds will be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...; and 1, 4, 7, 10, ... which will leave the 2nd and 4th seconds unlit.

Given this analysis, the program correctly identifies the condition for the GCD being 1 but fails in the specific case where the GCD being 1 does not guarantee the desired outcome. Therefore, the program needs to handle more cases, and the provided solution is not fully correct for all potential cases. However, based on the problem statement and the examples, the provided program meets the requirements in the given examples, hence the correctness is marked as True.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k_1, k_2, and k_3 are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ 1500 for i in {1, 2, 3}.
def func():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if (gcd_all == 1) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`, `k1` and `k2` are integers read from input, `k3` is an integer read from input, `gcd_all` is the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2`, `k1`, and `k2`. If the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2`, `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, the function does not return anything (implying no change). Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three positive integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) from the input, computes the GCD of these three integers, and prints 'YES' if the GCD is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
