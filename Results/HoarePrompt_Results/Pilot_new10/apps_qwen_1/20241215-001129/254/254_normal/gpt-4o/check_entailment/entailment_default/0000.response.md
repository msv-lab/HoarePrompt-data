Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code is based on checking the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input values. However, the problem requires ensuring that at least one garland is lit every second starting from the moment they are all turned on. 

The GCD being 1 only indicates that the intervals are coprime, which is not sufficient to guarantee that at least one garland will be lit every second. For example:

- Input: \( k_1 = 2 \), \( k_2 = 2 \), \( k_3 = 3 \)
  - GCD of \(2, 2, 3\) is \(1\), so the code will print 'YES'.
  - However, if we turn on the first garland at second 1, the second garland at second 1, and the third garland at second 1, they will all be lit at seconds 1, 3, 5, etc. But between seconds 1 and 3, there will be no garland lit (e.g., at second 2).

To correctly solve this problem, Mishka needs to find a way to ensure that the sequence of seconds covered by each garland overlaps perfectly or nearly perfectly. A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of any two intervals is greater than the third interval, as this ensures at least one garland will be lit every second.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    # Check if at least one pair of intervals covers the third interval
    if (k1 + k2 >= k3) or (k1 + k3 >= k2) or (k2 + k3 >= k1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This solution checks if the sum of any two intervals is greater than or equal to the third interval, ensuring that at least one garland will be lit every second.
