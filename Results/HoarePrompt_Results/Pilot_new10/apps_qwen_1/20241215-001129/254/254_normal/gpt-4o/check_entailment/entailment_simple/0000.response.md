Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) as required by the problem statement.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) first, and then the GCD of the result with \( k_3 \). This effectively determines the smallest periodic interval that all three garlands' states share.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the final GCD (\( \text{gcd\_all} \)) is 1. If it is, it means that the three garlands can be switched on in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on, at least one garland will be lit. This is because the periodicity condition is satisfied if the GCD of the intervals is 1.
4. **Output**: Depending on the result of the GCD check, the program prints either 'YES' or 'NO', as specified in the problem statement.

The logic is sound and covers all cases described in the examples:
- In the first example, \( \text{gcd}(2, 2, 3) = 1 \), hence the output is 'YES'.
- In the second example, \( \text{gcd}(4, 2, 3) = 1 \) does not hold, hence the output is 'NO'.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
