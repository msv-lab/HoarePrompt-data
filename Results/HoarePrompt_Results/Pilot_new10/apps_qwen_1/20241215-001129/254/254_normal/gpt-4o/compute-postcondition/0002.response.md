The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `gcd_k1_k2`, `k1`, and `k2` with `k3` using `math.gcd`. The initial state is that `gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`, `k1` and `k2` are integers read from input, and `k3` is an integer read from input. After executing the code, `gcd_all` will be assigned the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2`, `k1`, and `k2`.

Output State: **`gcd_k1_k2` is the GCD of `k1` and `k2`, `k1` is an integer read from input, `k2` is an integer read from input, `k3` is an integer read from input, `gcd_all` is the GCD of `gcd_k1_k2`, `k1`, and `k2`**
