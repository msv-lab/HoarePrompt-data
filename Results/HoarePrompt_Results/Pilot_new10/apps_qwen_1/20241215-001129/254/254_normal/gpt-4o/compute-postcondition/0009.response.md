The annotated code indicates that the function reads three positive integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) from the input, where each integer is between 1 and 1500. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these three numbers. The function checks if the GCD is 1 and prints 'YES' if it is, and 'NO' otherwise.

However, upon analyzing the code, we can see that the function does not actually return anything; it only prints the result ('YES' or 'NO') directly. There are no explicit return statements in the function.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is as follows:

Functionality: **The function reads three positive integers \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_3 \) from the input, computes the GCD of these three integers, and prints 'YES' if the GCD is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.**
