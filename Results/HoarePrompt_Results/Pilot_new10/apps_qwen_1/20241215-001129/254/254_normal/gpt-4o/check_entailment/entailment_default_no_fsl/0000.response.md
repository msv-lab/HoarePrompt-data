Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input values and checks if it is equal to 1. However, this approach is incorrect for determining whether Mishka can light up at least one garland every second. The problem requires ensuring that at least one garland is lit every second starting from the moment they are all turned on simultaneously.

For example, consider the case where the inputs are \( k_1 = 2 \), \( k_2 = 2 \), and \( k_3 = 2 \). According to the current implementation, the GCD of these values is 2, which is not 1, so the program outputs 'NO'. However, Mishka can turn on the garlands at \( x_1 = 1 \), \( x_2 = 1 \), and \( x_3 = 1 \), meaning the first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, etc., and similarly for the other two garlands. This means that every second after turning them on will have at least one garland lit, so the correct output should be 'YES'.

The correct approach would involve checking if the maximum of the differences between the starting times and the GCD of the periods covers all seconds. However, a simpler and more direct approach is to check if the sum of the reciprocals of the periods minus their pairwise LCMs is greater than 1. For simplicity, we can directly check if the GCD of the three numbers is 1 or not, but the current implementation is flawed because it does not handle all cases correctly.
