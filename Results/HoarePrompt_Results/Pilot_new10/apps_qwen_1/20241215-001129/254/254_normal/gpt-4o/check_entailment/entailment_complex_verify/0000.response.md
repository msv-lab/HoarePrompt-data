Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. The program correctly calculates the GCD of the three input intervals and checks if the GCD is 1. If the GCD is 1, it means the intervals are coprime, and it is possible to cover all seconds after a certain point with at least one lit garland. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the logic is sound for any input values within the specified range. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
