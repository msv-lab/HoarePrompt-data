Final: **False**

Reason: Although the program correctly checks if the GCD of the three time intervals is 1, it does not handle the case where the GCD being 1 does not guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland every second after switching them on. The output hints and the provided examples show that the program prints 'YES' for inputs like (4, 2, 3), which should actually print 'NO' based on the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment cannot be considered accurate as the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
