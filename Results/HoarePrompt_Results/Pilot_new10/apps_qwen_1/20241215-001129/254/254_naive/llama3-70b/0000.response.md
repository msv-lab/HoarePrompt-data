Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the given time intervals. However, the LCM calculation is flawed. The provided `func_1` function calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), not the LCM. To calculate the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b`, you should use the formula `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)`. Additionally, the LCM of three numbers can be calculated by iteratively applying this formula.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

For input:
```
2 2 3
```

The expected output is `YES`, as shown in Example 1. However, the program outputs `NO` because it incorrectly calculates the LCM.

To fix this, you need to correctly calculate the LCM for three numbers. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)

lcm12 = lcm(k1, k2)
lcm123 = lcm(lcm12, k3)

if lcm123 >= max(k1, k2, k3):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

This corrected version should work for all valid inputs according to the problem description.
