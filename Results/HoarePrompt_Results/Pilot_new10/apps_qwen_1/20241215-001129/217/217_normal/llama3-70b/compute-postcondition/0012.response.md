The value of `c` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it. Given that `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, and `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element of the list `a`. Since `c` was initially set to `a[1]`, the new value of `c` will be `c + a[1]`, which simplifies to `c + c` or `2 * c`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is 0, `c` is `2 * a[1]`, `i` is 1**
