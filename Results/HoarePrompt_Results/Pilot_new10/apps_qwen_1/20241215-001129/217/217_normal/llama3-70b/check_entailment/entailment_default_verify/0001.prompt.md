You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    (b, c) = (0, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            b += a[i]
        else:
            c += a[i]
    print(b - c)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program sorts the array in descending order before partitioning it into two subsequences `b` and `c`. However, the sorting step is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following input:
```
4
-1 -2 -3 -4
```

The expected output is 8 because we can partition the sequence into `b = {-1, -3}` and `c = {-2, -4}`, resulting in `B = -4` and `C = -6`, so `B - C = 2`.

However, the current implementation would sort the array to `[-1, -2, -3, -4]` and then partition it into `b = [-1, -3]` and `c = [-2, -4]`, which gives the same result of `B = -4` and `C = -6`, but it incorrectly calculates `B - C = 2`.

A correct approach would be to consider each element and decide which subsequence it belongs to based on maximizing `B - C` without sorting the array. For example:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b, c = 0, 0
    
    for num in a:
        if b <= c:
            b += num
        else:
            c += num
            
    print(b - c)
```

This approach ensures that we always add the current number to the subsequence that will maximize the difference `B - C`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `a` where the length `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and each element in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function sorts the list in descending order and then calculates the difference between the sum of elements at even indices and the sum of elements at odd indices. The function prints this difference. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
