The code initializes two new variables `b` and `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `n` and `a`. Therefore, the value of `n` remains an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `a` remains a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order; `b` is 0; `c` is 0.**
