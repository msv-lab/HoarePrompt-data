The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `a` is a list of `n` integers, the input should contain exactly `n` space-separated integers. 

After executing the code, the value of `n` remains unchanged, but the list `a` is updated with the new integers provided by the user. However, since the exact integers provided by the user are not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of `a`. We only know the length of `a` remains `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is an integer satisfying -100 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, and the list `a` is updated with the new integers provided by the user.**
