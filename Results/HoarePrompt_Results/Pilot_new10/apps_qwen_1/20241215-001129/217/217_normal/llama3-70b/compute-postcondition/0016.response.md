The code `c += a[i]` updates the value of `c` by adding the value of `a[i]` to `c`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `c` is updated to `c + a[2]`.

Since `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `a[2]` is the third largest element in the list.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order
- `b` is either `b + a[1]` or 0
- `c` is either `a[1]` or `2 * a[1]`
- `i` is 2

The only changes occur to `c`. Therefore, the new value of `c` is `c + a[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is either `b + a[1]` or 0, `c` is `c + a[2]`, `i` is 2**
