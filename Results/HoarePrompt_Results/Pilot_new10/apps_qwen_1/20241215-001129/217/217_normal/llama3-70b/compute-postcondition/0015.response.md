`b` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `a[2]` is the third largest element in the list. However, the exact value of `a[2]` is not specified. Therefore, `b` becomes `b + a[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is either `b + a[2]` or `b + 0`, `c` is either `a[1]` or `2 * a[1]`, `i` is 3**
