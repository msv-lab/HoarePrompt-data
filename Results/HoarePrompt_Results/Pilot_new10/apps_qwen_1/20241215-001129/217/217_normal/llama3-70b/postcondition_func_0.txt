The function accepts a list of integers `a` where the length `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and each element in the list satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function sorts the list in descending order and then calculates the difference between the sum of elements at even indices and the sum of elements at odd indices. The function prints this difference.
