`b` is incremented by `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `a[1]` is the second largest element in the list. The value of `b` is updated to `b + a[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `b` is `b + a[1]`, `c` is `a[1]`, `i` is 1**
