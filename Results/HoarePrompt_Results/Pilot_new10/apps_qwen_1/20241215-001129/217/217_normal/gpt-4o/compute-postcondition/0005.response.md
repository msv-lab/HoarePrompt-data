The code prints the value of `result`, which is already defined as `B - C`. Here, `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`, and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`. Printing `result` does not change its value or the values of other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `B` is the sum of all positive integers in the list `a`; `C` is the sum of all negative integers in the list `a`; `result` is `B - C`; the value of `result` is printed.**
