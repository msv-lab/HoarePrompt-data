`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` will take an integer value between 1 and 100 (inclusive) based on the initial state. The list `a` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
