The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function should operate on a list `a` of `n` integers, where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies \(-100 \leq a_i \leq 100\).

The output cases are not explicitly stated, so we focus on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies \(-100 \leq a_i \leq 100\).**
