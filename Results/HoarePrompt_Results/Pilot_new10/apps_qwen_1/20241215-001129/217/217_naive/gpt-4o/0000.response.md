Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of \( B - C \) by summing the positive elements and the negative elements separately and then computing their difference. This approach ensures that all elements are partitioned into two groups, and the sums \( B \) and \( C \) are maximized for the given condition. Since the program handles all given examples correctly and there is no potential case found where it does not work as expected, the program is correct.
