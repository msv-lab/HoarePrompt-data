Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to sort the array in descending order and then alternately adds elements to two different sums (`b` and `c`). However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the value of `B - C`.

For instance, consider the input:
```
4
-10 -20 -30 -40
```

The program would sort the array as `[-10, -20, -30, -40]` and then add elements alternately to `b` and `c`:
- `b` = -10 + (-30) = -40
- `c` = -20 + (-40) = -60

Thus, `B - C = -40 - (-60) = 20`.

However, the optimal partitioning would be:
- `b` = [-10, -20] -> Sum = -30
- `c` = [-30, -40] -> Sum = -70

Therefore, `B - C = -30 - (-70) = 40`, which is greater than 20.

This counterexample shows that the program does not always find the maximum possible value of `B - C`, making it incorrect.
