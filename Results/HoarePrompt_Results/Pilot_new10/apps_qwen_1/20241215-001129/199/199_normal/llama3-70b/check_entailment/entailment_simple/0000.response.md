Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Rectangle Formation**:
   - The program checks if `2 * (a + b) == n`, which means the sum of two pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` must be `n` to form a rectangle. However, this condition alone does not guarantee that the four parts can form a rectangle but not a square.
   - For example, with `n = 20`, the program would incorrectly include `{4, 4, 6, 6}` as a valid way, which forms a square and thus does not meet the requirement of forming a rectangle but not a square.

2. **Missing Constraint for Non-Square Formation**:
   - The problem specifies that the formed shape must be a rectangle but not a square. Therefore, the program needs to ensure that all four parts have different lengths.
   - The current logic allows for cases where `a` and `b` can be equal, leading to possible square formations, which violates the problem constraints.

3. **Logic for Ensuring Different Lengths**:
   - The program should ensure that `a` and `b` are distinct, and then check that the other two parts `c` and `d` (which are `n - 2 * (a + b)` divided into two parts) are also distinct and non-zero.

### Corrected Program:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    ways = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, (n - a) // 2 + 1):  # Ensure a < b
            c = (n - a - b) // 2
            d = n - a - b - c
            if c > 0 and d > 0 and a != b and a != c and a != d and b != c and b != d and c != d:
                ways += 1
    
    return ways
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Outer Loop (`a`)**: Iterates over possible values for the first part of the stick.
- **Inner Loop (`b`)**: Iterates over possible values for the second part, ensuring `a < b`.
- **Calculation of `c` and `d`**: Calculate the third and fourth parts based on the remaining length.
- **Check for Validity**: Ensure that all parts are positive and distinct.
- **Count Valid Ways**: Increment the count of valid ways to cut the stick.

This corrected program ensures that the sticks are cut in such a way that they can form a rectangle but not a square, meeting the problem description accurately.
