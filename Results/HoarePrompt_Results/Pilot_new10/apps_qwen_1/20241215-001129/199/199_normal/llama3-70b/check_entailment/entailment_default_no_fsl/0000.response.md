Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it only counts pairs (a, b) such that \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) and \(a \neq b\), which is not sufficient to ensure that the parts can form a rectangle but not a square. The constraints for forming a rectangle while ensuring no square can be formed are more complex.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that:
1. The four parts can form a rectangle (which means two pairs of equal lengths).
2. No pair of parts is equal (to prevent forming a square).

The current implementation only checks for pairs that satisfy \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) and \(a \neq b\), but it does not ensure that the remaining parts also form a valid rectangle without forming a square. For example, consider the input `20`. The correct output should be `4` because the valid partitions are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. However, the provided code does not handle this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
n = int(input())
ways = 0

for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
    for b in range(a + 1, (n - 2*a) // 2 + 1):
        c = (n - 2*a - 2*b) // 2
        if 2 * (a + b) == n and a != b and b != c and a != c:
            ways += 1

print(ways)
```

This corrected version ensures that the parts can form a rectangle (two pairs of equal lengths) and no square is formed (all parts are distinct).
