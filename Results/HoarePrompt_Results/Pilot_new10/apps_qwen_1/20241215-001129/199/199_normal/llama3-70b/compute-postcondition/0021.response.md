Let's analyze the given information and the for loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - \( n \geq 3 \)
  - \( a = \frac{n}{2} + 1 \)
  - \( b \) is incremented by 1 each iteration, starting from its initial value.
  - \( \text{ways} = 2 \) if \( a \neq b \) and \( 2 \times (a + b) = n \).
  - Otherwise, \( \text{ways} = 1 \).

### For Loop:
```python
for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `b` from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - At the start of the loop, `b` is set to `a`.
   - The loop continues as long as `b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.

2. **Incrementing `b`**: In each iteration, `b` is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- Let's denote the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration as \( b_{\text{prev}} \).
- Since `b` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, \( b \) will be \( b_{\text{prev}} + 1 \).
- The loop will continue as long as \( b_{\text{prev}} + 1 < (n - a) // 2 + 1 \).

### New State:
- \( n \geq 3 \) (remains unchanged)
- \( a = \frac{n}{2} + 1 \) (remains unchanged)
- \( b \) will be \( b_{\text{prev}} + 1 \) at the start of the next iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is \( b < (n - a) // 2 + 1 \).

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `b` is \(b_{\text{prev}} + 1\), and the loop continues as long as \( b < (n - a) // 2 + 1 \)**.
