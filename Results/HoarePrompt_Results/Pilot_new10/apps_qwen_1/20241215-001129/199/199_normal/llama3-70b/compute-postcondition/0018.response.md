Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\).
   - `b` is a value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 * (a + b) = n\).
   - `ways` is set to 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs over values of `b` starting from `a` up to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).
   - For the loop to continue, there must be a valid value of `b` within this range.
   - The loop will stop when `b` exceeds \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was some value within the range `[a, (n - a) // 2]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1 and stay within the range.
   - If `b` reaches \((n - a) // 2 + 1\), the loop will terminate.

5. **New Values:**
   - Since `b` was within the range, it must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Let's denote the new value of `b` as `b_new` = `b + 1`.

6. **Adjusted States:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `b` is now `b + 1`.
   - `ways` remains 1 since the loop body is omitted and no changes are mentioned.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `b` is `b + 1`, and `ways` is set to 1.**
