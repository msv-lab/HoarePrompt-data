Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is the total number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq \frac{n}{2}\), \(a \neq b\), and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\).**

### Explanation:
- **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs when `n` is greater than or equal to 3 because the inner loop starts from `a` and goes up to `\(\frac{n - a}{2} + 1\)`. This ensures that `2 \times (a + b) = n` can be satisfied with valid pairs `(a, b)`.
- **Inner Loop Conditions**: The outer loop iterates over possible values of `a` starting from 1 to `\(\frac{n}{2}\)`, and the inner loop iterates over possible values of `b` starting from `a` to `\(\frac{n - a}{2} + 1\)`. The condition `2 \times (a + b) = n` checks if the pair `(a, b)` satisfies the equation.
- **Increment of `ways`**: For each valid pair `(a, b)` that satisfies the condition, `ways` is incremented by 1. This continues until all possible pairs have been checked.

Since the loop checks all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the specified range, after the loop completes, `ways` will hold the total count of such pairs. If no valid pairs exist (which would happen if `n` is less than 3), `ways` remains 0.
