According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `a` from 1 to `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `ways` is the number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \leq n // 2\), \(a \neq b\), and \(2(a + b) = n\).

To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration:

1. **Check the current value of `a`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` would have been the highest value it could have taken in the previous iteration, which is `n // 2`.

2. **Determine the next value of `a`:**
   - The loop increments `a` by 1, so if the previous value of `a` was `n // 2`, the next value of `a` would be `n // 2 + 1`.

3. **Check the condition for continuing the loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. If `a` becomes greater than `n // 2`, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state:**
   - Since `a` must be less than or equal to `n // 2` for the loop to continue, `a` should be set to `n // 2 + 1` (the next possible value).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, so `n` stays as "greater than or equal to 3".
   - The variable `ways` remains unchanged as well since the problem does not indicate any modification of `ways` based on the loop iteration itself.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is the number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \leq n // 2\), \(a \neq b\), and \(2(a + b) = n\), `a` is \(n // 2 + 1\)**
