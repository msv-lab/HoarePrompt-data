The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9. The function calculates the total number of pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n/2, a ≠ b, and 2 * (a + b) = n, and returns the total number of such pairs.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return the total number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.
