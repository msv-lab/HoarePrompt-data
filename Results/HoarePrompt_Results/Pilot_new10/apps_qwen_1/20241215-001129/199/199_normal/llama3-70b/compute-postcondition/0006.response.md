Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `ways` is 1.
   - `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
   - `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - Twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a, (n - a) // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs over values of `b` starting from `a` up to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
   - For each value of `b`, the condition `a <= b < (n - a) // 2 + 1` must hold true.

4. **Determining the Next Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
     - `a` and `b` satisfy the condition `a <= b < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.
     - `twice the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n` (i.e., `2 * (a + b) == n`).

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `b` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next value of `b` will be `b + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `b + 1` must still satisfy the condition `a <= b + 1 < (n - a) // 2 + 1`.

6. **Ensuring the Condition Holds:**
   - The new value of `b` is `b + 1`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - The condition `2 * (a + b + 1) == n` must hold for the next iteration.

7. **Final States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to 3).
   - `ways` remains 1.
   - `a` remains the same (less than or equal to `n // 2`).
   - `b` is now `b + 1`.
   - `2 * (a + (b + 1)) == n` must hold for the next iteration.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 1, `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and twice the sum of `a` and `b + 1` equals `n`.
