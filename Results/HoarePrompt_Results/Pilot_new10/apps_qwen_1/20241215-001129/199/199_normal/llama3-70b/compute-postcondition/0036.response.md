To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop executes and how the variable `ways` is updated.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `a` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\).
   - `b` is the last value such that \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) (if any).
   - `ways` is the count of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions within the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a` to \((n - a) // 2 + 1\).
   - For each value of `b`, the condition \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `ways` is incremented by 1.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `ways` will be the total number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a \neq b\) and \(2 \times (a + b) = n\) within the specified range.

4. **Special Case**:
   - If no valid pairs exist, `ways` will remain 0.
   - The final values of `a` and `b` depend on the initial conditions and the loop's execution.

### Final Output State:

- **`n`**: Remains as it was initially, since the loop does not change the value of `n`.
- **`a`**: Remains \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\), as this value is set before the loop starts and is not modified within the loop.
- **`b`**: The final value of `b` depends on the last valid pair found during the loop's execution. If no valid pairs are found, `b` remains as its initial value (which is the last value that satisfies the condition).
- **`ways`**: The total number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) found during the loop's execution.

### Output State:
