State before the loop starts: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 0

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `b` in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
2. **Initial Value of `b`**: The loop starts with `b` as `a`, and the condition for continuing the loop is `b <= (n - a) // 2 + 1`.
3. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be less than or equal to `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

Given the constraints:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- We need to ensure that there is at least one value of `b` that satisfies the condition.

To satisfy the loop condition:
- We need to ensure that `(n - a) // 2 + 1` is at least 1. This means `n - a` should be at least 1, and thus `n` should be at least `a + 1`.
- Additionally, `a` must be less than or equal to `n // 2` because if `a` were greater than `n // 2`, then `(n - a) // 2 + 1` would be less than 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to include the initial value of `a` such that the loop can start executing.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ways` is 0, `a` is less than or equal to `n // 2`**
