Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the condition `if a != rem // 2:` is incorrect. This condition is checking if the two sides of the rectangle formed by the four pieces are not equal, which is necessary to ensure that a square cannot be formed. However, this condition alone is insufficient to guarantee that a rectangle can be formed.

For instance, consider the input `20`. According to the problem description, the valid ways to split the stick are `{1, 1, 9, 9}`, `{2, 2, 8, 8}`, `{3, 3, 7, 7}`, and `{4, 4, 6, 6}`. The code fails to include `{1, 1, 9, 9}` because the loop increments `count` only when `a != rem // 2`, but in this case, `a` (which is 1) is indeed equal to `rem // 2` (which is also 9 // 2 = 4). Therefore, the condition `if a != rem // 2:` fails, and the count is not incremented for this case.

To fix this, the condition should ensure that the two sides of the rectangle are different. A corrected version would involve checking if the two sides `a` and `b` are different after setting `b = a` and calculating `rem`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            b = rem // 2
            if a != b:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This version correctly counts the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that they can form a rectangle but not a square.
