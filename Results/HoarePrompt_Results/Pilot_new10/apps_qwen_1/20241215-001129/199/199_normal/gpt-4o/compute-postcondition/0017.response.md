Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9\) and \(n \geq 6\), `count` is either 1 or 2, `b` is \(n // 4 + 1\), `rem` is \(\frac{n}{2} - 2\), and `a` is \(n // 4 + 1\). If `rem` is greater than 0 and even, `count` becomes 2 and the state remains unchanged if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
