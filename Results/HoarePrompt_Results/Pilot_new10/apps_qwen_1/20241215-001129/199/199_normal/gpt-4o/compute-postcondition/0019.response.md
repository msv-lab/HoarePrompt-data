First, let's analyze the initial state:
- \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9 \) and \( n \geq 6 \).
- \( \text{count} \) is either 1 or 2.
- \( b = n // 4 + 1 \).
- \( \text{rem} = \frac{n}{2} - 2 \).
- \( a = n // 4 + 2 \) (since the loop does not execute again).

Next, let's consider the code snippet:
```python
b = a
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of \( a \) is already defined as \( n // 4 + 2 \).
2. The code assigns the value of \( a \) to \( b \). So, \( b \) now holds the value of \( a \), which is \( n // 4 + 2 \).

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **\( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^9 \) and \( n \geq 6 \); \( \text{count} \) is either 1 or 2; \( b = n // 4 + 2 \); \( \text{rem} = \frac{n}{2} - 2 \); \( a = n // 4 + 2 \)**
