Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code reveals that the original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where the remaining length after the first two cuts can be split into two equal parts, which violates the condition of not being able to form a square. Specifically, the program does not check if the remaining length (`rem`) can be split into two equal parts while still forming a rectangle. For example, in the case of `20`, the program would miss the valid way `{5, 5, 5, 5}` because it does not check if the remaining length can be split into two equal parts while still forming a rectangle. Therefore, the program fails to account for all valid cases as described in the problem statement.
