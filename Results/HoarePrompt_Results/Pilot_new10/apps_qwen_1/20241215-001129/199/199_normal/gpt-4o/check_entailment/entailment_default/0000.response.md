Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code aims to count the number of ways to split the stick into four parts such that it is possible to form a rectangle but not a square. However, the logic in the `func_1` function does not fully cover all necessary conditions.

The code checks for pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq \frac{n}{4}\), \(n - 2(a + b)\) is positive and even, and \(a \neq \frac{n - 2(a + b)}{2}\). This condition ensures that the remaining length can be split into two equal parts, but it does not ensure that the resulting parts can form a rectangle but not a square.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that:
1. The stick can be split into four parts to form a rectangle (i.e., two pairs of equal lengths).
2. The stick cannot be split into four equal parts (i.e., no square).

The current implementation does not handle the requirement to check if the remaining length can be split into two equal parts without forming a square. For example, consider the input `20`. The valid splits should be \({1, 1, 9, 9}\), \({2, 2, 8, 8}\), \({3, 3, 7, 7}\), and \({4, 4, 6, 6}\). However, the code does not correctly identify these cases.

A correct implementation would involve ensuring that the remaining length after choosing \(a\) and \(b\) can be split into two equal parts without making all four parts equal. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        b = a
        rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
        if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
            c = rem // 2
            d = c
            if a != c and b != c:
                count += 1
    return count

n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))
```

This version correctly checks for valid splits that form a rectangle but not a square.
