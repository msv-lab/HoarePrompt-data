Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is 0. If the next operation `op` is 'D', then `y` is decreased by 1. If the next operation `op` is 'L', then `x` remains unchanged (still 0). If `op` is 'R', then `x` becomes 1. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `operations` remain unchanged.***
