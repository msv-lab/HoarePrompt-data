The code initializes `final_x` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, or `y`. After this line of code is executed, `final_x` is set to 0, but the value of `n` and the contents of `operations` remain unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string consisting of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `y` is an integer such that -10^9 <= y <= 10^9, `final_x` is 0.**
