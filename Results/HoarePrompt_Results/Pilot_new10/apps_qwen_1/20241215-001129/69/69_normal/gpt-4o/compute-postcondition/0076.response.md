The code snippet `target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy` assigns the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` to `target_pos`. This does not affect the individual values of `current_x`, `current_y`, `dx`, and `dy` directly, but it creates a new value for `target_pos`.

- `current_x` and `current_y` remain unchanged and can be either -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations.
- `dx` remains unchanged and is either 0.
- `dy` remains unchanged and is either -1 or 0.
- `target_pos` is now set to the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is either -1 or 0, `min_length` is updated based on the operations and target positions, `current_x` and `current_y` are either -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations, `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `position_map` is updated accordingly based on the operations performed. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to `i + 2`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
