Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each character in the `operations` string.
- For each 'U', the value of `final_y` increases by 1.
- For each 'D', the value of `final_y` decreases by 1.
- For each 'L', the value of `final_x` decreases by 1.
- For each 'R', the value of `final_x` increases by 1.
- After all iterations, `final_x` and `final_y` will reflect the cumulative effect of all operations performed.

Since the loop runs for exactly `n` times (where `n` is the length of the `operations` string), the values of `final_x` and `final_y` will be the final positions after all operations have been applied. The values of `x` and `y` represent these final positions, and they will be equal to `final_x` and `final_y`, respectively, after the loop completes.
