The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `operations` is a string consisting of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.

After executing the function body, the function returns either 0 or -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a string `operations`, and two integers `x` and `y`, and return either 0 or -1 based on certain conditions within the function body.
