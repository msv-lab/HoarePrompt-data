The code updates the `target_pos` by adding `dx` to `current_x` and `dy` to `current_y`. The `target_pos` is defined as a tuple containing these updated values.

From the initial state:
- `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0.
- `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0.
- `final_x` is `x`.
- `final_y` is `y`.
- `dx` is 0.
- `dy` is either -1 or 0.
- `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`.

After executing the line `target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy`:
- `current_x` remains unchanged (since no operation changes its value directly).
- `current_y` might have changed based on operations, but `dy` is already considered in the target calculation.
- `dx` is 0, so it does not affect `target_pos`.
- `dy` is added to `current_y` to form the target position.

Therefore, the new `target_pos` is exactly `(current_x, current_y + dy)`, which simplifies to `(current_x, current_y + dy)` because `dx` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0; `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0; `final_x` is `x`; `final_y` is `y`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is either -1 or 0; `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x, current_y + dy); `position_map` is updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i + 1`.**
