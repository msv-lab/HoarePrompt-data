Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is either 0 or 1, and `final_x` is decreased by 1 if `op == 'L'`, otherwise `final_x` is increased by 1 if `op == 'R'`. The value of `final_x` remains unchanged if `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R'.***
