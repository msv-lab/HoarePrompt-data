You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, operations is a string consisting of n characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and x, y are integers such that -10^9 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`.
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if (dx == 0 and dy == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is 0, `dx` is not 0 or `dy` is not 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        
        target_pos = current_x + dx, current_y + dy
        
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is either -1 or 0, `min_length` is the minimum distance between any repeated configuration of `(current_x, current_y)`, `current_x` is the final horizontal position, `current_y` is the final vertical position, `position_map` is a dictionary where each key is a position `(current_x, current_y)` and each value is the index `i` where the position was last updated, `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` and is checked against the `position_map` during each iteration.
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
    #-1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: an integer `n`, a string `operations` consisting of `n` characters ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'), and two integers `x` and `y`. It first calculates the final positions `final_x` and `final_y` based on the operations. If the net changes `dx` and `dy` are both zero, it returns 0. Otherwise, it uses a dictionary to track the positions visited and calculates the minimum distance to a previously visited position that results in the same net changes `dx` and `dy`. If such a position is found, it returns the minimum distance; otherwise, it returns -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
