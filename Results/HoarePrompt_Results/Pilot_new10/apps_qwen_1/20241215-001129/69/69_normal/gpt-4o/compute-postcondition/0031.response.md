`final_x` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is unchanged and remains less than `n`. The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y` are not affected. 

Output State: **`final_x` is increased by 1, `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is either 0 or 1**
