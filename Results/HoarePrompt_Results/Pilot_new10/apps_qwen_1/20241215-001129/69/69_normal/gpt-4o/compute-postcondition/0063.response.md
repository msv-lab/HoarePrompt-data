Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is either -1 or 0, `min_length` is `inf`, `current_x` is either -1 or 0, `current_y` is 1 or -1, `position_map` is `{(0, 0): -1}`, `target_pos` is one of `(0, 0)`, `(-1, 0)`, or `(-1, -1)`. The condition `target_pos in position_map` is true.**
