Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0; `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0; `final_x` is `x`; `final_y` is `y`; `dx` is 0; `dy` is either -1 or 0; `current_x` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the operations at index `i+1` in `operations`; `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `position_map` is updated such that the key `(current_x, current_y)` maps to the value `i + 1` if the operation at index `i` is 'R'.**
