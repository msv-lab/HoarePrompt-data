Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is the net change in the horizontal position starting from 0, `y` is the net change in the vertical position starting from 0, `final_x` is `x`, `final_y` is `y`, `dx` is 0, `dy` is either -1 or 0, `current_x` and `current_y` are either -1, 0, or 1 depending on the operations, `target_pos` is the tuple `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`, and `position_map` is updated accordingly based on the operations performed. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, `min_length` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
