`final_y` is decremented by 1. The value of `final_y` was initially 0, so now it is -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1; `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `final_x` is 0; `final_y` is -1.
