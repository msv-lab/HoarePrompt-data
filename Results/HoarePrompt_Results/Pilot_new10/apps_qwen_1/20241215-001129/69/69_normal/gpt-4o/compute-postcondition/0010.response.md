`final_x` is decreased by 1. Since `final_x` was initially 0, after executing `final_x -= 1`, the value of `final_x` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' characters, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, and the operation `op` is 'L'.**
