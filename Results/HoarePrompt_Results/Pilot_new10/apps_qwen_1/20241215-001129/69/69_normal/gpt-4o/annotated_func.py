#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: an integer `n`, a string `operations` consisting of `n` characters ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'), and two integers `x` and `y`. It first calculates the final positions `final_x` and `final_y` based on the operations. If the net changes `dx` and `dy` are both zero, it returns 0. Otherwise, it uses a dictionary to track the positions visited and calculates the minimum distance to a previously visited position that results in the same net changes `dx` and `dy`. If such a position is found, it returns the minimum distance; otherwise, it returns -1.
