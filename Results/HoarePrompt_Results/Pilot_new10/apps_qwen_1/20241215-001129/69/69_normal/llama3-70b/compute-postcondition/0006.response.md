`uy` is assigned the value of `uy + 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `uy`, it is assumed to be an integer. The value of `uy` is incremented by 1, but the exact initial value is not known. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is 'U', `uy` is `uy + 1`.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` is 'U', `uy` is `uy + 1`**
