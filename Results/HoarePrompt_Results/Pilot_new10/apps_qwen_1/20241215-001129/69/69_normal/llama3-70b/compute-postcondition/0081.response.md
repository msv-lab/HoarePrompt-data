Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string with at least two more characters, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions. If the operation is 'U' and `dy` (which is `y - uy - 1`) is greater than 0, `dy` is decremented by 1. If the operation is 'D' and `dy` is less than 0, `res` is 1; if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, `res` is 1; otherwise, `res` is 2 or 3.***
