`uy` is decremented by 1. Since `uy` was not previously specified, we cannot give its exact value, but we know that it has been decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ops` is a non-empty string, and the operation `op` is 'D'; `uy` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, and the operation `op` is 'D'; `uy` is decreased by 1.**
