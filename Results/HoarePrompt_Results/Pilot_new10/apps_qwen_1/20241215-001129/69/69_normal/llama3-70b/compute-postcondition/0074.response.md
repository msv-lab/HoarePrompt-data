`dy` is incremented by 1, based on the initial state, `dy` is equal to `y - uy`. Since `uy` is 0, `dy` is initially `y`. After adding 1 to `dy`, the new value of `dy` is `y + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string with at least two more characters, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, `dy` is `y + 1`, and `res` is 1 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, otherwise `res` is 2.**
