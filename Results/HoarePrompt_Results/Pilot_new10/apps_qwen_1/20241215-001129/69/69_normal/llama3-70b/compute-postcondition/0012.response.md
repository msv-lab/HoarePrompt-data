The code increments `ux` by 1. Since `ux` was not explicitly initialized or given a value in the initial state, it is considered to be 0 by default. Therefore, after executing `ux += 1`, the value of `ux` becomes 1. The operation `op` remains unchanged and is still 'R'. 

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 1, `op` is 'R'**
