The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of the variable `res` without changing its value. Therefore, the value of `res` remains the same as it was before the print statement. The other variables (`ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is the final horizontal displacement, `dy` is the final vertical displacement, `res` is the count of operations that did not affect `dx` or `dy`.**
