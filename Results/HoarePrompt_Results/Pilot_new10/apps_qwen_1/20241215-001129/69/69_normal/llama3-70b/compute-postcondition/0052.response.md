The code `dx -= 1` decrements the value of `dx` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `dx` is greater than 0.
- `dy` is greater than or equal to 0.

Decrementing `dx` by 1 means `dx` will now be one less than its original value, but it will still be greater than or equal to 0 (since it started greater than 0 and is only reduced by 1).

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux` - 1, `dy` is `y - uy`, `res` is 0, `op` is 'R', `dx` is greater than or equal to 0, and `dy` is greater than or equal to 0**
