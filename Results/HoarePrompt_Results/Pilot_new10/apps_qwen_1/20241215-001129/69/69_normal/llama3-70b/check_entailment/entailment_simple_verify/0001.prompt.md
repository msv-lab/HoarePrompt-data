You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to make the robot reach the target coordinates. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the initial sequence of operations already reaches the target coordinates, leading to an incorrect output of `res` being printed in such cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
RULR
1 1
```

The correct output should be `0` because the sequence `RULR` already moves the robot to `(1, 1)`. However, the program incorrectly calculates and prints the result without checking if the initial sequence already reaches the target.

To fix this, you need to add a check at the beginning to see if the initial sequence already reaches the target coordinates. If it does, the answer should be `0`. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    
    (ux, uy) = (0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    
    if (ux, uy) == (x, y):
        print(0)
    else:
        (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
        res = len(ops)
        for i in range(n):
            (ux, uy) = (0, 0)
            for j in range(i, n):
                if ops[j] == 'U':
                    uy += 1
                elif ops[j] == 'D':
                    uy -= 1
                elif ops[j] == 'R':
                    ux += 1
                elif ops[j] == 'L':
                    ux -= 1
                
                if (ux, uy) == (x, y):
                    res = min(res, j - i + 1)
                    break
        
        if res == len(ops):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(res)

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the initial sequence already reaches the target and prints `0` if it does. It then iterates through all possible subsegments to find the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target, ensuring the program handles all cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0. If `dx < 0` or `dy < 0`, then -1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, `dx` is the final horizontal displacement, `dy` is the final vertical displacement, and `res` is the count of operations that did not affect `dx` or `dy`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
