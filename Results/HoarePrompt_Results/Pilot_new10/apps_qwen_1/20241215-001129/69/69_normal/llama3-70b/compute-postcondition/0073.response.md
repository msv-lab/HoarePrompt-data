`dy` is decreased by 1. The initial value of `dy` is `y - uy`, so after subtracting 1, the new value of `dy` is `y - uy - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string with at least two more characters, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, `dy` is `y - uy - 1`, and `res` is 1 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, otherwise `res` is 2.**
