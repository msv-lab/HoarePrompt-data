According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ops`. The loop will execute if `ops` is a non-empty string. Since the initial state already specifies that `ops` is a non-empty string, no adjustments are needed for `ops`.

The other variables (`ux`, `uy`, `dx`, `dy`, `res`) are used within the loop but their values before the loop starting do not directly affect whether the loop executes. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `res` is 0, both `dx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dy` is greater than or equal to 0**
