Postcondition: ***`ops` is a non-empty string with at least two more characters, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, `dy` is `y - uy`. If the operation is 'D' and `dy < 0`, `res` is 1; if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, `res` is 1; otherwise, `res` is 2 or 3.***
