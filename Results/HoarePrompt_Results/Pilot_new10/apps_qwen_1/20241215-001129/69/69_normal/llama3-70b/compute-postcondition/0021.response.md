`uy` is assigned the value `uy + 1`. Since `uy` was initially part of the string `ops`, its original value is unknown, but it is now incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `op` can be 'U', 'D', 'R', or 'L', `uy` is the original value of `uy` + 1.**
