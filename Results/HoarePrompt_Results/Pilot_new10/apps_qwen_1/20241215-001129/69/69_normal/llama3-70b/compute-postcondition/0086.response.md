Functionality: ** The function processes a string of operations ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and two integers `x` and `y` to determine the final position after performing the operations. If the final coordinates (x, y) are negative, it prints -1. Otherwise, it counts and returns the number of operations that did not affect the final coordinates (x, y). **

Explanation:
- The function accepts an integer `n` (though it is not used in the provided code), a string `ops` consisting of 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' operations, and two integers `x` and `y`.
- It calculates the net changes in the x and y coordinates (`ux`, `uy`) based on the operations.
- After determining the net changes, it checks if the final coordinates (dx, dy) are negative. If either `dx` or `dy` is negative, it prints -1.
- If both `dx` and `dy` are non-negative, it iterates through the operations again to count how many operations did not affect the final coordinates (dx, dy) and prints this count.

Potential edge cases and missing logic:
- The initial values of `ux` and `uy` are set to 0 before processing the operations, ensuring correct calculations.
- The function correctly handles the operations 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' and updates the net changes accordingly.
- The final coordinates (dx, dy) are checked to determine if they are negative, and the appropriate action is taken based on this check.
- The counting of operations that did not affect the final coordinates (dx, dy) is done correctly within the second loop.
