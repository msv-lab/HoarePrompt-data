The code `dx -= 1` decrements the value of `dx` by 1. The value of `dx` was previously adjusted based on the operation and its conditions, and now it is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ops` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is the original value of `dx` minus 1, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 1 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, otherwise `res` is 0.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is the original value of `dx` - 1, `dy` is `y - uy`, and `res` is 1 if the operation is 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, otherwise `res` is 0.**
