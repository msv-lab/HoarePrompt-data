The function processes a string of operations ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and two integers `x` and `y` to determine the final position after performing the operations. If the final coordinates (x, y) are negative, it prints -1. Otherwise, it counts and returns the number of operations that did not affect the final coordinates (x, y).
