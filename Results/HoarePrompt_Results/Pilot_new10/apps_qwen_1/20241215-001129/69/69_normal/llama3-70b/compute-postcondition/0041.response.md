The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `ops`, `ux`, `uy`, `dx`, or `dy`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ops` is a non-empty string, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and -1 is printed to the console.**
