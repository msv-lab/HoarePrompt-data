Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to construct the lexicographically largest sequence when the required `k` is greater than the number of bits set in `n`. 

Consider the following input:
```
Input
13 2
```

The expected output should be:
```
No
```

However, the program outputs:
```
Yes
3 2 
```

This is incorrect because there is no way to express 13 as the sum of two powers of 2 with a sequence of length 2. The correct response should be "No", indicating that such a sequence does not exist. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly.
