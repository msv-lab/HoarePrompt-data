Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case when `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is 1. Specifically, for inputs like `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the program should output `Yes` followed by `-1`, since \(2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = 1\). However, the current implementation checks if `len(bits) > k` and returns 'No', which is incorrect for this specific case. 

Here's a test case that demonstrates the issue:
- Input: `2 1`
- Expected Output: `Yes -1`
- Actual Output: `No`

This shows that the program does not handle the case correctly, hence the correctness is False.
