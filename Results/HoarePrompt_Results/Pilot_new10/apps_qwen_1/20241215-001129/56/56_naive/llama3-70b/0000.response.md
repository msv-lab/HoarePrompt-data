Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than the smallest possible sum that can be achieved with `k` integers. Specifically, the program checks if `n < k` and prints "No" immediately, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, we should be able to express `n` as a sum of `k` powers of 2 even if `n < k`, as long as we include zeros in the sequence. For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 5`, the correct output should be `Yes 0 0 0 0 0`, but the program will incorrectly print "No".

Here is an example of a case where the program fails:
- Input: `1 5`
- Expected Output: `Yes 0 0 0 0 0`
- Program Output: `No`

The program should handle this case correctly by ensuring it can always produce a sequence of length `k` that sums up to `n`, even if it means including zeros.
