Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `k` correctly. Even though `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the program incorrectly prints "No" without considering the possibility of including zeros in the sequence to reach the required length `k`. For example, in the input `1 5`, the expected output is `Yes 0 0 0 0 0`, but the program will print "No". Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program needs to be modified to handle such cases.
