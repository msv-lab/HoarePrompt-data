Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code reveals that the program does not correctly handle cases where the required `k` is greater than the number of bits set in `n`. Specifically, the program does not output "No" when such a sequence does not exist, leading to incorrect results. For instance, the input `(13, 2)` should result in "No", but the current implementation incorrectly outputs "Yes" with the sequence `[3, 2]`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be corrected to properly handle these edge cases.
