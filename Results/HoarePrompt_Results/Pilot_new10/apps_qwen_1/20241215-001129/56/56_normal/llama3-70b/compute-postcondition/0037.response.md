Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^{18}\), `k` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ \(10^{5}\). If `n` is less than `k`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from the original value of `n` in descending order, `i` is the number of iterations performed, and if the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.***
