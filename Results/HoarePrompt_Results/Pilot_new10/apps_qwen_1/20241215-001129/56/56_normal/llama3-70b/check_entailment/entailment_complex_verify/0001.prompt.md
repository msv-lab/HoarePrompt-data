You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('No')
    else:
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            if x <= i:
                break
            a.append(x)
            n -= 2 ** x
            i += 1
        if len(a) < k:
            print('No')
        else:
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to construct the lexicographically largest sequence when the required `k` is greater than the number of bits set in `n`. 

Consider the following input:
```
Input
13 2
```

The expected output should be:
```
No
```

However, the program outputs:
```
Yes
3 2 
```

This is incorrect because there is no way to express 13 as the sum of two powers of 2 with a sequence of length 2. The correct response should be "No", indicating that such a sequence does not exist. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('No')
    else :
        a = []
        i = 0
        while n > 0:
            x = n.bit_length() - 1
            
            if x <= i:
                break
            
            a.append(x)
            
            n -= 2 ** x
            
            i += 1
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step.
        #
        #### Step-by-Step Analysis
        #
        #1. **Initialization**:
        #   - `n` is an integer with \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
        #   - `k` is an integer with \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\), and `n \geq k`.
        #   - `a` is an empty list.
        #   - `i` is 0.
        #
        #2. **Loop Execution**:
        #   - The loop continues as long as `n > 0`.
        #   - In each iteration:
        #     - `x = n.bit_length() - 1`: This calculates the highest bit position set in `n`.
        #     - If `x <= i`, the loop breaks.
        #     - Otherwise, `a.append(x)`: Adds the value of `x` to the list `a`.
        #     - `n -= 2 ** x`: Decrements `n` by the value of \(2^x\).
        #     - `i += 1`: Increments the index `i`.
        #
        #3. **Observations from Example Iterations**:
        #   - After 1 iteration: `n` becomes `n - 2`, `i` is increased by 1.
        #   - After 2 iterations: `n` remains unchanged (since the next `x` would not satisfy the condition to append to `a`), `i` is increased by 1.
        #   - After 3 iterations: `n` becomes 2, `x` is 3, `a` contains [3], and `i` is 1.
        #
        #4. **General Pattern**:
        #   - The loop extracts the highest bit set in `n` and appends it to `a` until no more bits are left.
        #   - The loop terminates when `n` becomes 0 or when the highest bit is less than or equal to `i`.
        #
        #5. **Final State**:
        #   - When the loop terminates, `n` will be 0.
        #   - `a` will contain a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from `n` in descending order.
        #   - `i` will be the number of iterations performed.
        #
        #### Final Output State
        #
        #Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
        #
        #**Output State: `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from the original value of `n` in descending order, and `i` is the number of iterations performed.**
        if (len(a) < k) :
            print('No')
        else :
            a = a[:k]
            a.sort(reverse=True)
            print('Yes')
            print(' '.join(map(str, a)))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from the original value of `n` in descending order, and `i` is the number of iterations performed. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, the string 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^{18}\), `k` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ \(10^{5}\). If `n` is less than `k`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from the original value of `n` in descending order, `i` is the number of iterations performed, and if the length of `a` is less than `k`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\)) and `k` (a positive integer between 1 and \(10^5\)). It calculates the highest bit set in `n` and stores these bits in a list `a`. If the length of `a` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the first `k` elements of `a` sorted in descending order.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
