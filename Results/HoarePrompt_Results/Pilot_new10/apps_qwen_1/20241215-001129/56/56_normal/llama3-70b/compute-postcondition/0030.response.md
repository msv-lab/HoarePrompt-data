The code `print('No')` prints the string 'No' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the highest bits extracted from the original value of `n` in descending order, `i` is the number of iterations performed, and the length of `a` is less than `k`. The string 'No' is printed to the console.**
