The code simply prints 'No', which does not affect the values of the variables `n` and `k`. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^{18}\), `k` is an integer obtained from user input, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ \(10^{5}\). The current value of `n` is less than `k`; no value is printed, only 'No' is printed.**
