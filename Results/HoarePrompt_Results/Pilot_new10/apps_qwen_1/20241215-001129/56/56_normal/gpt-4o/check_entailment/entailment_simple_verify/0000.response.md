Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code reveals that the program still does not handle the case where `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is 1 correctly. Specifically, the program checks if `len(bits) > k` and returns 'No' in this case, which is incorrect. For example, for the input `2 1`, the expected output is `Yes -1`, but the actual output is `No`. This issue is not addressed by the annotated version, confirming that the original assessment was accurate.
