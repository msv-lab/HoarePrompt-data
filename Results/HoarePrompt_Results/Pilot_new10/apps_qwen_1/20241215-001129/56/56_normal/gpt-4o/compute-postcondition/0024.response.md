The code appends `smallest - 1` to the list `bits`. Since `smallest` is the last element in `bits` before the pop operation, and `len(bits) < k` must hold true at the start of the next iteration, we know that `smallest` was the only element in `bits` (or possibly more, but after popping, it was the last one).

Therefore, `bits` now contains `smallest - 1` and `len(bits)` is still less than `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `bits` is a list containing `smallest - 1`, `smallest` is the last element in `bits` before the pop operation, and `len(bits) < k` holds true.**
