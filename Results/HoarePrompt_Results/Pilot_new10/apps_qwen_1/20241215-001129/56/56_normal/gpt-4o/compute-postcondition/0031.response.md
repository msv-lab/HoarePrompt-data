The `bits` list is sorted in reverse order. Since `bits` originally contains the indices of the bits set to 1 in `n` (where each index is either the original index or one less than the original index of the smallest bit index popped from `bits`), sorting `bits` in reverse order does not change its values but only changes its order. The initial state of `n` and `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `bits` is a list of length `k` containing the indices of the bits set to 1 in `n` where each index is either the original index or one less than the original index of the smallest bit index popped from `bits`, and `bits` is sorted in reverse order.**
