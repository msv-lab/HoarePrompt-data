Let's break down the given information and the for loop to determine the necessary adjustments.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\) and \(k \leq n\)
- `bits` is an empty list
- The for loop iterates over the range from 60 to -1 with a step of -1.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(60, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will start with `i = 60` and continue until `i` becomes less than -1, decrementing by 1 each time.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the specified range (60 to -1).

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` initialized to 60.
   
2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to -1.
   - Therefore, `i` must be within the range [60, -1].

3. **No Direct Dependence on `n` and `k`:**
   - The values of `n` and `k` are not directly used in the loop condition or initialization.
   - They may influence the context or behavior of the loop body, but they don't affect the loop's execution directly.

4. **State of `bits`:**
   - The `bits` list is initially empty. This doesn't affect the loop's execution but may be relevant for the loop body.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute correctly is the initial value of `i`, which should be set to 60. No other state adjustments are necessary based on the given information.

### Final State:
**State: **`i` is 60, `bits` is an empty list**
