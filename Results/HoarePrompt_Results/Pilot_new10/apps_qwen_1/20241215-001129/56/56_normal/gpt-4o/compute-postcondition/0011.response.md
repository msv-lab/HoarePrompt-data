According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 60 down to 0, decrementing by 1 each time. The loop condition for the iteration is based on the variable `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n` is an integer.
- `i` is 59.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 58.

The loop will continue to check the bit at position 59 of `n` for each value of `i` in the range from 60 to 0. Since the bit at position 59 of `n` is not relevant to the loop's continuation (it only affects what happens inside the loop body, not the loop itself), it remains unchanged.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 58**
