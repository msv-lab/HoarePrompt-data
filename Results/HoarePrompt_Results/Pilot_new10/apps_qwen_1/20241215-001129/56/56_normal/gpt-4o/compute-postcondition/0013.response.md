Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is 58. If the bit at position 58 of `n` is 1, then the function does nothing (since there is no specific action mentioned for the if part other than the condition check). Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition remains as the precondition unless the bit condition is met, in which case the bit at position 58 of `n` is 1.***
