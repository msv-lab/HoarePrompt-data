Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input in a specific format and extracts the values of `n` and `k`. This matches the input format described in the problem statement.

2. **Initial Validation**: The function `func_1` first checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it immediately returns 'No'. This ensures that the initial validation aligns with the problem constraints.

3. **Bit Manipulation**: The program uses bitwise operations to extract the positions of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`. It iterates from the highest bit position (60) down to 0, appending the index of any bit that is set to 1. This step correctly identifies the necessary bits to form the sum `n`.

4. **Adjustment and Completion**: If the number of set bits is less than `k`, the program attempts to adjust the bits to ensure that the resulting list has exactly `k` elements. It pops the smallest bit index and appends the next smaller index twice. This ensures that the sum of \(2^{\text{bits}[i]}\) still equals `n` while minimizing the maximum value in the sequence.

5. **Sorting and Output**: Finally, the program sorts the list of bit indices in reverse order to achieve the lexicographically largest sequence. It then outputs 'Yes' followed by the modified list of bit indices.

### Why It Always Follows the Problem Description:

- **Sum Constraint**: The program ensures that the sum of \(2^{\text{bits}[i]}\) equals `n`, meeting the sum requirement.
- **Minimum Maximum Value**: By adjusting the bit indices and sorting them, the program minimizes the maximum value in the sequence.
- **Lexicographical Order**: The reverse sorting ensures that among sequences with the same maximum value, the program outputs the lexicographically largest one.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `k` is greater than `n` or the number of set bits in `n` is less than `k`.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic required to meet the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
