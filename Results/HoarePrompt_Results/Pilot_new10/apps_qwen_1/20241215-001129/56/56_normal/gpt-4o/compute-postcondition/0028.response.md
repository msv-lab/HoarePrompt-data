`bits` is updated by appending `smallest - 1` to the list. Since `smallest` is the last element in the original `bits`, the new last element of `bits` will be `smallest - 1`. The length of `bits` increases by 1, but it is still less than `k`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `smallest` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `bits` is a list containing elements including the last element `smallest - 1`, `smallest` is the last element in the original `bits`, and `len(bits) < k` still holds true.**
