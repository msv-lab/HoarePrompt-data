`bits` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `n` shifted right by `i` bits and bitwise AND with 1 results in a non-zero value, which means that the least significant bit (LSB) of the result is 1. However, the code itself does not affect the values of `n` or `i`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is an integer, and bits contains the value of `i`**
