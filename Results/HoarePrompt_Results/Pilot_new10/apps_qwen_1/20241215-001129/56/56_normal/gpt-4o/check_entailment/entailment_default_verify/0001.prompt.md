You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Jamie is preparing a Codeforces round. He has got an idea for a problem, but does not know how to solve it. Help him write a solution to the following problem:

Find k integers such that the sum of two to the power of each number equals to the number n and the largest integer in the answer is as small as possible. As there may be multiple answers, you are asked to output the lexicographically largest one. 

To be more clear, consider all integer sequence with length k (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}) with $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} 2^{a_{i}} = n$. Give a value $y = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq i \leq k} a_{i}$ to each sequence. Among all sequence(s) that have the minimum y value, output the one that is the lexicographically largest.

For definitions of powers and lexicographical order see notes.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the required sum and the length of the sequence.


-----Output-----

Output "No" (without quotes) in a single line if there does not exist such sequence. Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes) in the first line, and k numbers separated by space in the second line — the required sequence.

It is guaranteed that the integers in the answer sequence fit the range [ - 10^18, 10^18].


-----Examples-----
Input
23 5

Output
Yes
3 3 2 1 0 

Input
13 2

Output
No

Input
1 2

Output
Yes
-1 -1 



-----Note-----

Sample 1:

2^3 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23

Answers like (3, 3, 2, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 2, 3, 3) are not lexicographically largest.

Answers like (4, 1, 1, 1, 0) do not have the minimum y value.

Sample 2:

It can be shown there does not exist a sequence with length 2.

Sample 3:

$2^{-1} + 2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$

Powers of 2:

If x > 0, then 2^{x} = 2·2·2·...·2 (x times).

If x = 0, then 2^{x} = 1.

If x < 0, then $2^{x} = \frac{1}{2^{-x}}$.

Lexicographical order:

Given two different sequences of the same length, (a_1, a_2, ... , a_{k}) and (b_1, b_2, ... , b_{k}), the first one is smaller than the second one for the lexicographical order, if and only if a_{i} < b_{i}, for the first i where a_{i} and b_{i} differ.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().strip().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 'No'
    bits = []
    for i in range(60, -1, -1):
        if n >> i & 1:
            bits.append(i)
    if len(bits) > k:
        return 'No'
    while len(bits) < k:
        smallest = bits.pop()
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
        bits.append(smallest - 1)
    bits.sort(reverse=True)
    return 'Yes\n' + ' '.join(map(str, bits))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `n` is very large and the binary representation of `n` has more bits than `k`. Specifically, the program checks if `len(bits) > k` after constructing the list of bits. However, this check is insufficient because the program does not ensure that the constructed sequence is lexicographically largest and has the smallest maximum value `y`.

Consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 1048575` (which is \(2^{20} - 1\)) and `k = 19`.
- The binary representation of `1048575` is `11111111111111111111`, which means we can represent `n` using 20 ones.
- According to the problem, the output should be a sequence of 19 numbers that sum up to `1048575` with the largest number as small as possible and the sequence being lexicographically largest.
- The correct output should be a sequence of 19 `10`s (since \(2^{10} = 1024\) and \(19 \times 1024 = 19456\), which is close to `1048575` and the largest number is minimized).

However, the provided program will not produce this output because it constructs a sequence of 19 `9`s (since the last `bits.pop()` operation will make the last two elements `9` instead of `10`). This results in a sequence like `[10, 10, ..., 10, 9, 9]`, which is not lexicographically largest.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for certain inputs, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than `n` or if the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, it processes the list of bit indices, adjusts them as needed, sorts the list in reverse order, and returns 'Yes' followed by a space-separated string of the modified bit indices. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
