Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program fails to handle the case when `n` is a power of 2 and `k` is 1. Specifically, for inputs like `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the program should output `Yes -1`, but instead, it outputs `No`. The provided output hints confirm that the function `func_1` returns 'No' if the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` is greater than `k`, which is incorrect in this special case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
