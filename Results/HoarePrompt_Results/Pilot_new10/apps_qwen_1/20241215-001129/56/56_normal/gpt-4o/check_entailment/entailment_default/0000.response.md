Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not guarantee that the resulting sequence is lexicographically largest when the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n` is less than `k`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Binary Representation Handling**: The code correctly extracts the positions of the set bits in the binary representation of `n`. However, if the number of set bits is less than `k`, it simply appends `-1` values to meet the required length `k`. This approach does not ensure that the resulting sequence is lexicographically largest.

2. **Adjusting Bits to Meet Length `k`**: When the number of set bits is less than `k`, the code appends `-1` values to the list. While this ensures the length is `k`, it does not guarantee the lexicographically largest sequence. For instance, consider the input `(n=17, k=4)`:
   - Binary representation of `17` is `10001`.
   - Extracted bits are `[4, 0]`.
   - The code will append two `-1`s, resulting in `[4, 0, -1, -1]`.
   - A lexicographically larger sequence would be `[4, 1, 1, 0]`.

This shows that the code does not produce the lexicographically largest sequence in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
