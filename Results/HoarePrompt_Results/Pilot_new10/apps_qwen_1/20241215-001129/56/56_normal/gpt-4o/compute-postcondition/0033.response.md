The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\).

The function returns:
- 'No' in Case_1.
- 'No' in Case_2.
- 'Yes\n' followed by a space-separated string of the elements in the list 'bits', which is sorted in reverse order and contains the indices of the bits set to 1 in `n` where each index is either the original index or one less than the original index of the smallest bit index popped from 'bits' in Case_3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions, return 'No' twice and 'Yes' followed by a specific formatted string in Case_3.
