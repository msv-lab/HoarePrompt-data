The code snippet `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `n`, `f`, `ind`, or `bind`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of these variables, but the console output will show `-1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is `-1`, `bind` is the index of the `':'` if a match is found, otherwise `bind` is `-1`, and the console prints `-1`.**
