Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is now `n - 2`, `f` is `True`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is an unspecified integer value, `i` is now `n - 2`. If `s[i] == ']'`, `total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is now `n - 2`, `f` is `True`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is an unspecified integer value, `i` is now `n - 2`. If `s[i] == ':'` and `f` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i] != ':'` or `f` is false, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
