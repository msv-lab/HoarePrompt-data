The code assigns `-1` to the variable `bind`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `f`, or `ind`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `bind`.

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is True if any '[' is found in the string, `ind` is the index of the first ':' following a '[', otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is -1**
