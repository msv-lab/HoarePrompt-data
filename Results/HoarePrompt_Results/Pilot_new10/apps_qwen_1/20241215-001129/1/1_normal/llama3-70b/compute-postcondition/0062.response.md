The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. It does not affect any of the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, `f`, `ind`, and `bind` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is `-1`, `bind` is the index of the `':'` if a match is found, otherwise `bind` is `-1`, and the console displays `-1`.**
