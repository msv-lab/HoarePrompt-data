The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`. It finds the first `:` following a `[` and the last `:` preceding a `]`. If either of these `:` is not found, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it counts the number of `|` characters between the indices of the found `:` and prints the count. If no matching `:` is found, it defaults to printing `4`.
