Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `f` is True, `ind` is the index of the first `':'` following a `['`, otherwise `ind` is -1, `bind` is equal to `i`, `s[i]` is not equal to `']'`, the current value of `s[i]` is `':'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.*** 

Explanation: Since the if part is the only part of the if-else block that changes the state (by setting `f` to True and updating `ind` and `bind`), and the else part does not change any state, the overall postcondition follows directly from the if part.
