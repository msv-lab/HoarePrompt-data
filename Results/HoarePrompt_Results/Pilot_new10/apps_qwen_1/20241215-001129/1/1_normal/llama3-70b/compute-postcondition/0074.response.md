Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if a `':'` follows a `['`, otherwise `f` is `False`, `ind` is a valid index within `s`, `bind` is a valid index within `s` such that `bind > ind + 1`, `i` is `bind + 1`. If `s[i]` is `|`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
