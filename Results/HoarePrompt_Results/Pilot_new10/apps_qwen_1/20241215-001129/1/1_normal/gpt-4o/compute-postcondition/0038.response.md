`start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`, and all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is set to a value within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is now `i`, the current value of `s[i]` is ':'.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is set to a value within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `i`, the current value of `s[i]` is ':'**
