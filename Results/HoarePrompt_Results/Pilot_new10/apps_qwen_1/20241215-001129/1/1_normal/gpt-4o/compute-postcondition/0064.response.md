Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `-1`, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is the index of the last colon found during the loop execution or `-1` if no colon is found.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `bind - 1` down to `ind` (inclusive).
   - It checks each character in the string `s` to find the first colon (`:`).

2. **Variables After Loop Execution:**
   - **`total`:** Since the loop only modifies `total` outside the loop body, and there is no addition or subtraction happening inside the loop, `total` remains `0`.
   - **`i`:** Once the loop breaks, `i` will be set to the index just before the found colon or remains `-1` if no colon is found. Since the loop decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`, the final value of `i` will be `-1`.
   - **`ind`:** This variable is unchanged by the loop and remains the same as its initial value, which is a non-negative integer less than `bind`.
   - **`start_colon`:** This is unchanged by the loop and remains `ind + 1` unless a colon is found, in which case it is irrelevant because the loop sets `start_colon` to `ind + 1` before the loop starts.
   - **`end_colon`:** This variable is updated to the index of the first colon found during the loop execution. If no colon is found, it remains `-1`.

### Conclusion:
- If a colon is found, `end_colon` will be the index of the first colon encountered, and `i` will be set to the index immediately following the colon.
- If no colon is found, `end_colon` will remain `-1`, and `i` will be set to `-1` since the loop would have completed without finding any colon.
