The code snippet `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `total`, `i`, `n`, `ind`, and `bind`. Therefore, the only change is the output printed to the console.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is -1, `n` is the original length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `[` in `s` (or -1 if `[` is not present), `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s` (or -1 if no `]` is present), and -1 is printed to the console.**
