`start_colon` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `i_val + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is `i_val + 2`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `i_val + 2`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_val + 2`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `i_val + 2`**
