`bind` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n - 3`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` can be either `-1` or the index of the first occurrence of `[`, `bind` is `n - 3`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` can be either `-1` or the index of the first occurrence of `[`, `bind` is `n - 3`**.
