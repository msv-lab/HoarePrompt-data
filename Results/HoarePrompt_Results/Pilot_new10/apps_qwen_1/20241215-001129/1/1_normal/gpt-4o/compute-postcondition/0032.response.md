Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is -1, `n` is the original length of `s`, `ind` is the index of the first occurrence of `[` in `s` (or -1 if `[` is not present), `bind` is the index of the last occurrence of `]` in `s` (or -1 if no `]` is present). The condition `(ind == -1 or bind == -1 or ind >= bind)` is true.**
