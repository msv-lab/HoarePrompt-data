The code `start_colon = i` assigns the value of `i` to `start_colon`. The initial state of `start_colon` is either `i_val + 1` (if `s[i_val + 1]` is `:`) or `-1` (if `s[i_val + 1]` is not `:`). Since `i` is now assigned to `start_colon`, `start_colon` will take the value of `i`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `total` is 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is `i_val + 1` (unchanged, but now referenced in `start_colon`)
- `ind` must be a non-negative integer (unchanged)
- `bind` must be a non-negative integer (unchanged)
- `start_colon` is now equal to `i`

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `i`**
