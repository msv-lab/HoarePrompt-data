The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block directly associated with the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but it indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional structure. 

The output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `bind - 2`, `ind` is a non-negative integer and must be less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, `end_colon` is `bind - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
