Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ind` is either `-1` (if no character `[` is found in `s`) or equal to the index of the first occurrence of `[` in `s`.
- `bind` is `-1`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.
2. **Variable `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` will be set to `n - 1`. The loop continues until `i` is less than `0`.

### Required Adjustments:
- **Variable `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be `n - 1` because the loop starts from `n - 1` and decrements.
- **Variable `n`**: Since `i` is initialized to `n - 1`, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to start.
- **Variable `ind`**: The value of `ind` does not directly affect the loop's execution but may influence other parts of the program logic. However, for the loop to start, we don't need to adjust `ind` unless there are specific conditions tied to its value.
- **Variable `bind`**: Similarly, `bind` being `-1` is fine as it does not affect the loop's starting condition.

### Conclusion:
The primary states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0 (no adjustment needed), `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` can be either `-1` or the index of the first occurrence of `[`, `bind` is `-1`**
