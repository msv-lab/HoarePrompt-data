The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since there is no explicit loop or conditional block in the initial state, the only effect of the `break` statement is to indicate that the execution would exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. However, since no such block is specified, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
