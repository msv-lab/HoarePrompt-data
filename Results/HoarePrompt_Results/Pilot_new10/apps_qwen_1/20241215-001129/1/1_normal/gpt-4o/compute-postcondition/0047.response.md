The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that a loop or conditional block is exited. Therefore, the values of `total`, `i`, `ind`, `bind`, and `start_colon` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_val + 2`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is `i_val + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
