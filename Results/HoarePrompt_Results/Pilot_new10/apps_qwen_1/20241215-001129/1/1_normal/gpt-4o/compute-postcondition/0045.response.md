Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `i_val + 1`
- `ind` must be a non-negative integer
- `bind` must be a non-negative integer
- If `s[i]` equals `':'`, then `start_colon` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `s[i]` does not equal `':'`, then `start_colon` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(ind + 1, bind):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute for values of `i` starting from `ind + 1` up to but not including `bind`.
2. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_val + 1`.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: For the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i_val + 2`.

### Adjusting the States:
- `total` remains the same, so it is still 0.
- `i` is updated to `i_val + 2`.
- `ind` and `bind` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.
- `start_colon` remains unchanged unless `s[i]` equals `':'` during this iteration, but since we don't know the value of `s[i]` at this point, we cannot assume any change.

### Final State:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_val + 2`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer.**

This ensures that the loop can continue executing if the condition `ind + 1 <= i < bind` is satisfied.
