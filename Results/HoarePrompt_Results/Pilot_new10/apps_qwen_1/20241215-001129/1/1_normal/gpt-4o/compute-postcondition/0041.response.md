Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is set to a value within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`
   - `ind` must be a non-negative integer
   - `bind` must be a non-negative integer
   - `start_colon` is either `i` (if `s[i]` is `:`) or remains `-1` (if `s[i]` is not `:`)

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(ind + 1, bind)`

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a value within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`
   - Since `i` was within this range, the loop has just completed one iteration.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range `(ind + 1, bind)`.
   - If `s[i]` is `:`, then `start_colon` is updated to `i`.

Given the above, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `total` remains `0` as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if it was previously `i_val`, now `i` will be `i_val + 1`.
- `start_colon` will remain `-1` unless `s[i_val + 1]` is `:`, in which case it will be updated to `i_val + 1`.
- `ind` and `bind` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the new state for the next iteration is:

**`total` is 0, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is either `i_val + 1` (if `s[i_val + 1]` is `:`) or remains `-1` (if `s[i_val + 1]` is not `:`).**

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `i_val + 1`, `ind` must be a non-negative integer, `bind` must be a non-negative integer, `start_colon` is either `i_val + 1` (if `s[i_val + 1]` is `:`) or remains `-1` (if `s[i_val + 1]` is not `:`)**
