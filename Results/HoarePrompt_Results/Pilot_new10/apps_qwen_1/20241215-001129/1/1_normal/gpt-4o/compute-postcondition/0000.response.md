The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `]`, `:` and `|`, and its length is between 1 and 500000 inclusive. After executing the code, the value of `s` will be the string input by the user, but the exact content of `s` is not specified in the initial state.

Output State: **The input string `s` is equal to the string input by the user, and it consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters `[`, `]`, `:`, and `|`, with a length between 1 and 500000 inclusive.**
