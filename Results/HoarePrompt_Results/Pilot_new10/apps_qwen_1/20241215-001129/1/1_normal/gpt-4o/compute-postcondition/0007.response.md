Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `ind` is either equal to `-1` (if the condition `s[i] == '['` is false) or equal to the current value of `i` (if the condition `s[i] == '['` is true). Additionally, if `s[i] == '['` is true, the current value of `i` is within the bounds of the string `s`.***
