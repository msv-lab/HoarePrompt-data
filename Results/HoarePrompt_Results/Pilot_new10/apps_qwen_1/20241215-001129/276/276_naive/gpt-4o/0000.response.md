Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the value of the golden system number. According to the problem description, the value of a number in the golden system is calculated as \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}\), but the program incorrectly calculates it as \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{i - 1}\).

For example, consider the number `1000`:
- According to the problem description, the value is \(q^3 \approx 4.236\).
- However, the program calculates it as \(q^0 + q^{-1} + q^{-2} + q^{-3}\), which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should adjust the power calculation to match the formula given in the problem description:
```python
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value
```
Should be changed to:
```python
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i)
    return value
```

This adjustment will correctly compute the value of the golden system number according to the given formula.
