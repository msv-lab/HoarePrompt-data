#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is 5, `value` is the sum of \(5^{(n - i - 1)}\) for all indices \(i\) where `s[i]` is '1', `n` is the length of string `s`.
    return value
    #The program returns the sum of \(5^{(n - i - 1)}\) for all indices \(i\) where `s[i]` is '1', with `n` being the length of string `s`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing a number in the golden system. It calculates and returns the sum of \(5^{(n - i - 1)}\) for all indices \(i\) where `s[i]` is '1', with `n` being the length of string `s`.
