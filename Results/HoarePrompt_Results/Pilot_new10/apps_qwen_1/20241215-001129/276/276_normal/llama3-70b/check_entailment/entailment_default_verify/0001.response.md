Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the conversion of numbers from the golden system to their decimal equivalents using the provided formula. The function `func_1` handles the conversion logic correctly, even though it implicitly handles the case of an empty string returning 0 without explicitly checking for it. The main logic of the program, which compares the decimal values of the two input strings, is also implemented correctly. The output hints provided align with the functionality of the program, confirming that the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, there is no evidence suggesting that the original assessment is incorrect.
