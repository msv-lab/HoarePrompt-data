Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
   - `q` is \(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\).
   - `decimal` is `int(c_last) * q`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the reversed string `s`.
   - `i` is the index of the current character in the reversed string.
   - `c` is the character at the current position.

4. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the reversed string `s`.
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute as long as there are characters to process.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we have processed one character from the reversed string.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, the string `s` will be the remaining part of the original string `s` (excluding the last character).

6. **Updated States:**
   - `s` will be the reversed string excluding the last character.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `c` will be the next character in the reversed string.

7. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `s` is the reversed string without the last character.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `c` is the next character in the reversed string.

Given the above steps, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is the reversed string without the last character, `i` is incremented by 1, `c` is the next character in the reversed string.**

To express this clearly in the required format:

**State: `s` is the reversed string without the last character, `i` is incremented by 1, `c` is the next character in the reversed string.**
