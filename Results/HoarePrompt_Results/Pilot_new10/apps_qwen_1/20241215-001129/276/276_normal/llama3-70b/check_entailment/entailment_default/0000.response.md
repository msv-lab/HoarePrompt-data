Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to compare two numbers in the golden system by converting them to their decimal equivalents. However, the comparison logic itself is missing. The program calculates the decimal values of both inputs using the `func_1` function but does not actually compare these values to determine which one is larger. Instead, it prints `>` if `decimal_a` is greater, `<` if `decimal_a` is smaller, and `=` if they are equal, which is already handled within the if-else conditions. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

To fix this, the program needs to include a comparison between `decimal_a` and `decimal_b` and print the appropriate symbol (`>`, `<`, or `=`) based on the result of this comparison. The current implementation only sets the decimal values and does not perform the necessary comparison.
