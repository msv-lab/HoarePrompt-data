The code `decimal += int(c) * q ** i` impacts the variables `decimal`, `c`, and `i`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `decimal` is updated by adding the product of `int(c)` and `q ** i` to its current value.
2. `c` remains the last character of `s`.
3. `i` is updated to be the length of `s` minus one.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
- `q` is `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`.
- `decimal` is 0.
- `c` is the last character of `s`.
- `i` is the length of `s` minus one.

Let's denote the last character of `s` as `c_last` and the length of `s` as `len_s`. Thus, `c` is `c_last` and `i` is `len_s - 1`.

The expression `int(c) * q ** i` will add the value of `c_last` converted to an integer (which is either 0 or 1) multiplied by `q` raised to the power of `len_s - 1` to `decimal`.

Therefore, the updated state will be:
- `decimal` is now `0 + int(c_last) * q ** (len_s - 1)`.
- `c` is `c_last`.
- `i` is `len_s - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters; `q` is (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2; `decimal` is int(`c_last`) * q ** (len(`s`) - 1); `c` is the last character of `s`; `i` is the length of `s` minus one.**
