Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `q` is (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2, `decimal` is the decimal representation of the binary string `s` when read in reverse order.** 

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** 
  - `s` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
  - `q` is \(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\).
  - `decimal` is 0.

- **Loop Code Analysis:**
  - The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s` using `enumerate`.
  - For each iteration, `decimal` is updated by adding \( \text{int}(c) \times q^i \), where \( c \) is the current character and \( i \) is the index (starting from 0).

- **Execution until Loop Completion:**
  - The loop will continue until there are no more characters left in the reversed string `s`.
  - Once the loop finishes, `s` will be an empty string because all characters have been processed.
  - The final value of `decimal` will be the sum of all terms \( \text{int}(c) \times q^i \) for all characters in the reversed string `s`.

- **Final Values:**
  - When the loop completes, `s` will be an empty string.
  - `q` remains unchanged and is \(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\).
  - `decimal` will hold the decimal representation of the binary string `s` when read in reverse order. Since `s` is now empty, `decimal` will represent the decimal equivalent of the original binary string `s` when reversed.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `s` is an empty string, `q` is \(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\), and `decimal` is the decimal representation of the binary string `s` when read in reverse order.
