Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly determine whether a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge. Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program uses an adjacency list (`graph`) to represent the directed graph.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The `has_cycle` function detects cycles in the graph using a topological sort approach. It checks if the number of nodes processed equals the total number of nodes, which indicates no cycles.
3. **Edge Removal and Cycle Check**: The `func_1` function first checks if the graph is already acyclic. If not, it iterates through each edge, temporarily removes it, and checks if the graph becomes acyclic. If any removal makes the graph acyclic, it returns "YES". If none of the edge removals make the graph acyclic, it returns "NO".

Given the logic and the examples provided, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly. No edge cases were found where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
