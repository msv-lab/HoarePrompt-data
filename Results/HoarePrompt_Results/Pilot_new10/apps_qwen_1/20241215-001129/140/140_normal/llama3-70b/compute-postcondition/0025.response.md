The code sets `rec_stack[node]` to `False`. This changes the value of the `rec_stack` list at index `node`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to, `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is False, `graph[node]` is empty or all neighbors have been processed.**
