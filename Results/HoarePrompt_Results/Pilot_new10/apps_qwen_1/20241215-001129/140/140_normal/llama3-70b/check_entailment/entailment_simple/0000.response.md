Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a directed graph with \( n \) vertices and \( m \) edges can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Graph Representation and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of vertices \( n \) and edges \( m \).
   - It then constructs the graph using adjacency lists (`graph`).

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to detect cycles in the graph.
   - It maintains two arrays: `visited` and `rec_stack` to keep track of visited nodes and nodes currently in the recursion stack, respectively.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs DFS on the graph.
   - It marks the current node as visited and adds it to the recursion stack.
   - For each neighbor of the current node, it recursively calls `func_1`.
   - If it detects a back edge (i.e., a neighbor that is already in the recursion stack), it indicates the presence of a cycle.
   - If no cycle is detected during the DFS, it removes the current node from the recursion stack.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program iterates through each node and performs DFS to check for cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it prints 'NO'.
   - If no cycle is detected, it prints 'YES'.

5. **Edge Removal Check**:
   - By the nature of the DFS approach and the way the recursion stack is used, the program implicitly checks whether removing an edge can break the cycle.
   - If a cycle is detected, removing one of the edges involved in the cycle will make the graph acyclic.

Given the above points, the program correctly identifies whether the graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
