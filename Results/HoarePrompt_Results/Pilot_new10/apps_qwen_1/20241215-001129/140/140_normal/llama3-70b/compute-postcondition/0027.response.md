The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. 

- `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to.
- `visited` is a list used to keep track of visited nodes.
- `rec_stack` is a list used to keep track of the recursion stack during depth-first search.

The function returns True in seven different cases and False in one case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `node`, a dictionary `graph`, and two lists `visited` and `rec_stack`, and return True under specific conditions (seven cases) or False (one case).
