To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each neighbor of the current node (`node`) in the `graph` dictionary.
2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
   - `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to.
   - `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively.
   - `visited[node]` is True.
   - `rec_stack[node]` is True.
   - `graph[node]` must contain at least one element.

3. **Loop Body**: For each neighbor `neighbor` in `graph[node]`, the function `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` is called. This function checks if the neighbor is already visited and updates the states accordingly.

Let's break down the loop execution step by step:

- **Current State**: `visited[node]` is True, and `rec_stack[node]` is True. The loop will continue as long as there are neighbors in `graph[node]`.
- **Loop Execution**: For each neighbor `neighbor` in `graph[node]`, `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` is called. If this function returns False, `visited[neighbor]` remains False. If `visited[neighbor]` is True (which would only happen if the function returns True), then `rec_stack[neighbor]` will be set to False.
- **Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.

Given these conditions, for the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
- There must be at least one unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`.
- After processing the current neighbor, the loop should proceed to the next neighbor.

Since the current `node` has at least one neighbor and the loop is about to process the next neighbor, the only state that needs to change is the index of the current neighbor being processed. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `node` remains the same.
- The current neighbor is being processed, so the next neighbor in `graph[node]` will be considered.
- `visited` and `rec_stack` will be updated based on the outcome of `func_1`.

The updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`total` is unspecified, `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to, `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, the current neighbor is being processed, and the next neighbor will be processed.**

However, for clarity and simplicity, we can focus on the explicit changes:

State: **`total` is unspecified, `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of vertices that the key vertex has directed edges to, `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists used to keep track of visited nodes and the recursion stack during depth-first search, respectively, `visited[node]` is True, `rec_stack[node]` is True, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, the current neighbor is being processed, and the next neighbor will be processed.**

This implies that the next neighbor in `graph[node]` will be processed, and the loop will continue until all neighbors have been processed or a cycle is detected.
