Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `node`, a dictionary `graph`, and two lists `visited` and `rec_stack`. It performs a depth-first search to detect cycles in the graph. If a cycle is detected, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. **

This summary covers the following points:
- The function accepts four parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`.
- It marks the current node as visited and adds it to the recursion stack.
- It iterates over all neighbors of the current node.
- If a neighbor has not been visited, it recursively calls `func_1` on that neighbor.
- If a neighbor has been visited and is also in the recursion stack, it indicates a cycle, and the function returns True.
- If no cycle is detected, it removes the current node from the recursion stack and returns False.

The function ensures that cycles are detected during the depth-first search traversal of the graph.
