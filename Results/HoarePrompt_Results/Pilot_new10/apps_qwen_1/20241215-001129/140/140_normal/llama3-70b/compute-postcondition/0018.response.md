Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for neighbor in graph[node]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `graph[node]`.
   - The loop body (omitted) performs some operations, including calling `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` and checking conditions based on `rec_stack`.

4. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, it must not return `True` or `None` immediately.
   - If `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` returns `True`, the function returns `True` and the loop stops.
   - If `rec_stack[neighbor]` is `True`, the function returns `True` and the loop stops.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `None`, allowing the loop to continue.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack` remain unchanged, these states do not change.
   - `total` remains unspecified as no operation directly modifies it within the loop.

Given the above analysis, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack)` must not return `True` and `rec_stack[neighbor]` must not be `True`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is unspecified, `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack` remain unchanged**.
