`queue` appends the value of `neighbor`. This means that `neighbor` is added to the end of the list `queue`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[node]` must include the next `neighbor`, `queue` includes the neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `count` is increased by 1.**
