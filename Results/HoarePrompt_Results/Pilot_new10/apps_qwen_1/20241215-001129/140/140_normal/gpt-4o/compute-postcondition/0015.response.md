The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1 for the current `v` in the loop, this operation directly modifies `in_degree[v]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`graph[u]` must contain at least one element; `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1**
