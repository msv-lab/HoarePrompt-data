You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the directed graph, m is an integer representing the number of edges, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v.
def func_1(n, m, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the directed graph, `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, `graph` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each (u, v) in `edges`, the list associated with the key u in `graph` now includes the vertex v.
    if (not has_cycle(graph)) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the directed graph, `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, `graph` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each (u, v) in `edges`, the list associated with the key u in `graph` now includes the vertex v, and the graph contains at least one cycle
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the number of vertices in the directed graph, `m` is the number of edges (reduced by the number of iterations), `edges` is an empty list, `graph` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each `(u, v)` in the original `edges`, the list associated with the key `u` in `graph` no longer includes `v`, the graph does not contain any cycles.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `edges`, where `n` is the number of vertices in a directed graph, `m` is the number of edges, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing directed edges. The function constructs a graph using the given edges and checks if the graph contains a cycle. If the graph initially does not contain a cycle, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it attempts to remove each edge temporarily, checking if the graph still contains a cycle after each removal. If removing any edge results in a graph without a cycle, the function returns 'YES'. If no such edge is found, the function returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to; n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: (0) for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` remains a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to; `n` and `m` remain as originally defined, but they do not change; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to an integer representing the total number of incoming edges to that vertex, and this integer is incremented by the number of times each vertex `v` appears in the lists of vertices that have outgoing edges from any vertex `u`.
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        count += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `graph[node]` is an empty list for all nodes, `queue` is an empty deque containing no nodes, `in_degree` is a dictionary where the value of each key (from 1 to `n`) is 0, and `count` is the total number of nodes with an in-degree of 0 that were processed during the entire execution of the loop.
    return count != n
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether not all nodes have an in-degree of 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `has_cycle` accepts a graph represented as a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to. It also accepts integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The function determines whether the graph contains at least one cycle by checking the in-degrees of the vertices. It returns `True` if there is at least one vertex with an in-degree not equal to 0, indicating the presence of a cycle, and `False` otherwise.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
