Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `graph[node]` is adjusted to exclude the current `neighbor`.
   - `queue` includes the `neighbor`.
   - `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.
   - `count` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `graph[node]` for each `neighbor`.

3. **Effect of the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted in the given information, but based on the initial states, it modifies the graph, queue, in-degree, and count as described.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the next `neighbor` from `graph[node]`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `graph[node]` should still have elements (i.e., `neighbor`).

5. **New State Adjustments:**
   - `graph[node]` needs to include the next `neighbor` to ensure the loop can continue.
   - `queue` should include this next `neighbor`.
   - `in_degree[neighbor]` should be decreased by 1 for this new `neighbor`.
   - `count` should be increased by 1 for this new iteration.

Therefore, the new state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`graph[node]` must include the next `neighbor`, `queue` includes the next `neighbor`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `count` is increased by 1.**
