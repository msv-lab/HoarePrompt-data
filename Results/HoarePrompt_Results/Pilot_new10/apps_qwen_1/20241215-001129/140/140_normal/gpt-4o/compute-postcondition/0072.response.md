`queue` appends the `neighbor`. The `neighbor` is added to the end of the `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[node]` is adjusted to exclude the current `neighbor`, `queue` includes the `neighbor`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`graph[node]` is adjusted to exclude the current `neighbor`, `queue` includes the `neighbor`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `count` is increased by 1.**
