The code snippet `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` to the end of the `queue`. Since the `neighbor` has an in-degree of 0, it was previously in the queue. However, after this operation, the `neighbor` is appended again, increasing its occurrence in the `queue`.

The initial state is as follows:
- `graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and the corresponding value is a non-empty list.
- `queue` is a deque containing at least one node with an in-degree of 0.
- `in_degree[neighbor]` is decremented by 1 and its current value is 0.

After executing the code snippet, the `queue` will have the `neighbor` appended to it.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and the corresponding value is a non-empty list; `queue` contains the node `neighbor` at least twice; `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0.**
