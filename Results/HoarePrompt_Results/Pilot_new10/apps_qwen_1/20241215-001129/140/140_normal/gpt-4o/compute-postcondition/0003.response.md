The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the value of `in_degree[v]` by 1. Given that `in_degree` is initialized such that each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to 0, incrementing `in_degree[v]` means that `v` now has an incoming edge count of 1.

The initial state provides us with the following conditions:
- `u` is a valid key in `graph`, and `graph[u]` contains at least one element.
- `graph` contains at least one key (vertex).
- `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
- `m` is in the range \(1 \leq m \leq \min(n(n - 1), 100000)\).
- `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is initially mapped to 0.

Since `in_degree[v] += 1` is executed, the value of `in_degree[v]` changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is a valid key in `graph`, and `graph[u]` contains at least one element; `graph` contains at least one key (vertex); `n` is in the range \(2 \leq n \leq 500\); `m` is in the range \(1 \leq m \leq \min(n(n - 1), 100000)\); `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to 0 except for `v`, which is now mapped to 1.**
