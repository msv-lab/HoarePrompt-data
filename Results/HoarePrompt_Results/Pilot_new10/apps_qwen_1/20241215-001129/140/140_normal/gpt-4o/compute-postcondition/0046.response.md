The code `node = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the `queue` and assigns it to the variable `node`. The `queue` is modified to remove this element.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and the corresponding value is a non-empty list; `queue` does not contain the leftmost element; `count` is the number of nodes with in-degree zero that have been processed**
