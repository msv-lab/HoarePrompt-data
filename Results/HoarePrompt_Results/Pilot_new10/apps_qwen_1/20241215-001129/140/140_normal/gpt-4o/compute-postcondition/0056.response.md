Postcondition: ***`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the next leftmost element and the `neighbor` appended, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, this condition is already met and remains unchanged. Otherwise, the original state is preserved since there is no else part provided that modifies the state further.***
