Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. The `func_1` function reads the input, constructs the graph, and checks if the graph contains a cycle. If it does, it attempts to remove each edge temporarily and rechecks the graph for cycles. If removing any edge makes the graph acyclic, it returns 'YES'. The `has_cycle` function correctly identifies the presence of cycles using topological sorting. The output hints align with the functionality of the code, confirming that the program handles all relevant cases as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
