The code initializes a dictionary called `in_degree` where the keys are integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and the values are all set to 0. This means that for each vertex from 1 to `n`, the in-degree (number of incoming edges) is initialized to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.

After running the code:
- The `in_degree` dictionary is updated with each key from 1 to `n` and each value set to 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to; `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to 0.**
