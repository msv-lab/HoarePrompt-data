The variable `count` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `graph`, `n`, `m`, `in_degree`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`graph` remains a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to; `n` and `m` remain as originally defined; `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` is mapped to an integer representing the total number of incoming edges to that vertex; `queue` is a deque containing nodes (vertices) with an in-degree of 0; `count` is 0.**
