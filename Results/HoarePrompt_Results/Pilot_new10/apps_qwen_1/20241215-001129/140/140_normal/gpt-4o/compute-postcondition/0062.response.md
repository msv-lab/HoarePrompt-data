According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` contains all nodes with in-degree zero. For the loop to execute one more time, there must still be nodes with an in-degree of zero in the `queue`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the states related to `graph[node]`, `in_degree[neighbor]`, or `in_degree[original_neighbor]`. The only state that needs to be ensured is that the `queue` is non-empty.

State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` must contain at least one node with in-degree zero, `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1 for all neighbors that were added to the queue, and `in_degree[original_neighbor]` retains its original value for other neighbors.**
