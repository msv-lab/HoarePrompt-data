The code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decrements the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` by 1. The initial state indicates that `graph[node]` is a non-empty list and `queue` does not contain the leftmost element. However, the values of `graph`, `node`, `in_degree`, and `neighbor` are not specified in the initial state. We know that `neighbor` is a key in the `in_degree` dictionary, and its value is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` does not contain the leftmost element, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1**
