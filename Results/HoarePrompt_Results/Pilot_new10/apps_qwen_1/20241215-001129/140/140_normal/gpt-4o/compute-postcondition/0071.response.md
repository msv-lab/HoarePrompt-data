The code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decrements the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated state is that `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`graph[node]` is adjusted to exclude the current `neighbor`, `queue` includes the neighbor if `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `count` is increased by 1.**
