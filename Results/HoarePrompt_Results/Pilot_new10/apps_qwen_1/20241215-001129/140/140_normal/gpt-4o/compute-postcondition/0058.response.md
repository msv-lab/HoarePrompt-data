The code decrements the `in_degree` of the `neighbor` by 1. Initially, `in_degree[neighbor]` is not specified, but it is not -1 anymore because the code explicitly decrements it. The `queue` and `graph` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the next leftmost element and the new `neighbor` appended, `in_degree[neighbor]` is the original value minus 1, `in_degree[new_neighbor]` is -1**
