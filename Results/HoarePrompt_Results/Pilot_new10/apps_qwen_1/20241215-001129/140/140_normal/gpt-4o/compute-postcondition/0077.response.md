Postcondition: ***`graph[node]` must include the next `neighbor`, `queue` includes the neighbor, `in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, and `count` is increased by 1. These conditions hold regardless of whether `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0 or not since there is no alternative action specified in the else part.***
