The code `in_degree[v] += 1` increments the `in_degree` value of `v` by 1. This means that the `in_degree` count for the node `v` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`graph[u]` must be non-empty for at least one node `u`, `u` is initialized to a node where `graph[u]` is non-empty, `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1 for the node `v` in `graph[u]`, and each `v` in `graph[u]` will be processed at least once.**
