To determine the necessary states for the given for loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can run. The loop iterates over the list of vertices that have an outgoing edge from vertex `u` (denoted as `graph[u]`). 

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop can execute if `graph[u]` contains at least one element. This means there must be at least one vertex that has an outgoing edge from `u`.

2. **Current State**: The current state is that `graph` remains a dictionary where keys are integers representing vertices, and values are lists of integers representing the vertices that each key vertex has outgoing edges to.

3. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop requires `graph[u]` to contain at least one element, the dictionary `graph` should have a non-empty list for `graph[u]`.
   - Additionally, since `v` is used within the loop, it implies that the loop will iterate over these elements. Therefore, we need to specify that `graph[u]` contains at least one element.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments to the initial state are:
- `graph[u]` must contain at least one element (integer).

State: **`graph[u]` must contain at least one element**
