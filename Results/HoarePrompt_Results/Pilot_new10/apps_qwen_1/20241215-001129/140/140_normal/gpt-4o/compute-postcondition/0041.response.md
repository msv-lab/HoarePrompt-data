The code `in_degree[neighbor] -= 1` decrements the value of `in_degree[neighbor]` by 1. The initial state is that `in_degree[neighbor]` has an in-degree value that, when decremented by 1, results in 0 (since `neighbor` is added to the queue only when its in-degree becomes 0). After decrementing, the new value of `in_degree[neighbor]` will be `-1`.

The initial state is:
- `graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and the corresponding value is a non-empty list.
- `queue` contains nodes such that for each node, `in_degree[next_neighbor]` has been decremented by 1, and `next_neighbor` has an in-degree of 0.
- `queue` now includes `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0, and `queue` must still contain at least one node with an in-degree of 0 or whose in-degree was reduced to 0.

After executing the code, `in_degree[neighbor]` is updated to -1, and the queue might or might not include `neighbor` depending on whether `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0 before the decrement. However, the key point is that `neighbor` is no longer considered for processing since its in-degree is now negative.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where `node` is a key and the corresponding value is a non-empty list; `queue` contains nodes such that for each node, `in_degree[next_neighbor]` has been decremented by 1, and `next_neighbor` has an in-degree of 0; `in_degree[neighbor]` is -1; `queue` now includes `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0 before the decrement, and `queue` must still contain at least one node with an in-degree of 0 or whose in-degree was reduced to 0.**
