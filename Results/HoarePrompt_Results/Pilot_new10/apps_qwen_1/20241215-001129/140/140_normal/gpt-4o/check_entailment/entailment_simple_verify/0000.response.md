Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a directed graph can become acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

- The program correctly reads the input and constructs the graph using adjacency lists.
- The `has_cycle` function uses a topological sorting approach (Kahn's algorithm) to detect cycles in the graph.
- The main function `func_1` iteratively removes each edge, checks if the graph becomes acyclic, and returns the appropriate result ('YES' or 'NO').

The annotations clearly show that the program follows the steps outlined in the original assessment and handles all necessary operations correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
