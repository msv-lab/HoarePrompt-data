Postcondition: ***`graph[node]` is a non-empty list, `queue` contains the next leftmost element, `neighbor`, and the new `neighbor`. `in_degree[neighbor]` is the original value minus 1, `in_degree[new_neighbor]` is -1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `queue` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
