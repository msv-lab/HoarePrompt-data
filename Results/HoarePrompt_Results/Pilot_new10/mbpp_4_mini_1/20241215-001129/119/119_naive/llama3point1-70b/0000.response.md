Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the problem description, which requires returning a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. Regardless of the input values for `a` and `b`, the output will always be a tuple in the format (b, a), satisfying the requirements of the problem description. For example, for inputs `func_1(2, 3)`, the output will be (3, 2), which is exactly as specified. Thus, there are no edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements.
