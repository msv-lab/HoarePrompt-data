Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes in two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple (b, a), effectively swapping their order. The provided assertions correctly validate the functionality by checking various cases, including integers (10, 20), (15, 17), and (100, 200). The output hints also align with the code's behavior, accurately describing that the function accepts two parameters and returns them in the swapped order. Since no edge cases or potential issues are identified, the program adheres to the problem description for all scenarios.
