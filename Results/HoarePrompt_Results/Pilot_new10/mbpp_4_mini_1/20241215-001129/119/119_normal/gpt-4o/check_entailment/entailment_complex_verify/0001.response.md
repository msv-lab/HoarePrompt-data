Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program implements the function `func_1`, which correctly takes two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, as specified in the problem description. The annotations confirm that the function returns the values in swapped order. Additionally, the assertions provided demonstrate that the function consistently meets the expected behavior for the tested input cases. Given these considerations and the assumption of valid inputs, the program is indeed correct in its implementation.
