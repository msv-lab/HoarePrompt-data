Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(a, b)` accurately meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes two numbers as input parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number, as stated in the problem.

The assertions provided confirm the correctness for specific integer inputs:

- `func_1(10, 20)` correctly returns `(20, 10)`.
- `func_1(15, 17)` correctly returns `(17, 15)`.
- `func_1(100, 200)` correctly returns `(200, 100)`.

The output hints further clarify that the function can accept both integers and floats and will still maintain the order of returning `(b, a)`. 

Since the function operates correctly according to the problem description for all tested cases, and since it logically applies to all potential inputs of numeric types (both integers and floats), I conclude that the function behaves as expected in every case. Hence, the correctness of the function is confirmed.
