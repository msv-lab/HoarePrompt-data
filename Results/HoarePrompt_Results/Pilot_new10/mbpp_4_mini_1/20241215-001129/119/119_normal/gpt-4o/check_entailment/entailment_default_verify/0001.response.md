Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem. The function takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns them in swapped order as a tuple `(b, a)`. 

The assertions demonstrated in the code confirm that for various pairs of input values, the function produces the expected output: a tuple with the second parameter first followed by the first parameter. The output hints further clarify that the function handles both integers and floats, which aligns with its implementation. 

Since the function satisfies the problem requirements and the assertions successfully validate its correctness for the tested cases, I conclude that the program works correctly in every potential case under the assumptions given (valid input).
