#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a in swapped order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b` (which can be either integers or floats) and returns them in swapped order as a tuple (b, a).
