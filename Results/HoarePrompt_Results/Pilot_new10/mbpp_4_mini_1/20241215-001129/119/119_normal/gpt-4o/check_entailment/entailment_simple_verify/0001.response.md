Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program correctly implements the function `func_1`, which takes two numbers as inputs, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing the second number first and then the first number (i.e., `(b, a)`). The assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the tested inputs, returning the correct and desired output for each case.

The annotated code further clarifies that prior to invoking the function, the inputs are indeed valid numbers (either integers or floats), and upon execution, the function correctly swaps the order of `b` and `a`. Given the problem description, the implementation is consistent, and all tested cases are handled correctly. Thus, I confirm that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
