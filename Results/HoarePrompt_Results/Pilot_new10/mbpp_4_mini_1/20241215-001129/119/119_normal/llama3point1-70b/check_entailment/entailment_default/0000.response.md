Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the order reversed, `(b, a)`. The output hints also confirm this, stating that the function "effectively reverses their positions." Since both the code and the hints agree with the problem description, I can conclusively state that the program performs correctly for every case.
