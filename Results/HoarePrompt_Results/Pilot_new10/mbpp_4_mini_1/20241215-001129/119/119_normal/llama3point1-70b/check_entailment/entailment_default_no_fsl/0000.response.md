Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns a tuple consisting of `b` first and `a` second, which effectively reverses their positions. 

This behavior meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs, including positive, negative, and zero values for both integers. There is no indication from the output hints or the function implementation that any potential edge cases would lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, the function operates correctly within the defined scope.
