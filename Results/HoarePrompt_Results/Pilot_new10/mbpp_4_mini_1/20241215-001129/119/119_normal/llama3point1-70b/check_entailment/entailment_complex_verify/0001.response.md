Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns them in a tuple with their positions reversed, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description. The examples provided in the assessment demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for a variety of inputs, consistently returning the second parameter first and the first parameter second. Since the annotations corroborate this behavior and there is no indication of incorrectness in the implementation based on the assumptions of valid input, the program is indeed correct.
