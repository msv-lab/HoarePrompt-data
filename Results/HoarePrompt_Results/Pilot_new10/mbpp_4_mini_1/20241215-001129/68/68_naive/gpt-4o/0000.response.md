Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the angle (or phase) of a complex number represented by its real and imaginary parts using the `cmath.phase` function. However, the program is incorrect because it lacks functionality for handling cases where both the real and imaginary parts are zero. 

In this case, passing `func_1(0, 0)` would result in a `ValueError` because the argument for phase calculation would effectively be `0 + 0j`, which yields an angle that is undefined. This leads to an exception that is not accounted for in the current implementation. 

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential edge cases outlined in the problem description.
