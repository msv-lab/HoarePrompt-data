The original assessment claimed that the program was incorrect due to not handling the case of both real and imaginary parts being zero. However, the problem description and the annotations provided offer an important context. The function `func_1` is designed to accept valid numerical inputs for the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and it was explicitly stated that we assume input will always be valid. 

The function built with `cmath.phase` correctly computes the phase of the complex number without division by zero issues, as it handles cases where the real part is zero (indicating a purely imaginary number) correctly. The specific case of input `(0, 0)` was not checked in the assertions but is irrelevant if we assume valid inputs.

Therefore, considering the assumption of valid input and the functionality described in the annotations, the program correctly computes the angle of the complex number for valid inputs. 

Thus, the original assessment claiming the correctness to be **False** appears to be inaccurate based on the provided understanding of the code's operation.

Final: **True**.
