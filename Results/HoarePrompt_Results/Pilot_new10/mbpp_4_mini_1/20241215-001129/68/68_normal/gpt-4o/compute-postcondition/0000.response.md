The variable `complex_number` is assigned the value of a complex number constructed from `real` and `imag`. Given that `real` and `imag` are numerical values, `complex_number` will hold a complex number in the form `real + imag * j`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`real` is a numerical value, `imag` is a numerical value, `complex_number` is equal to `real + imag * j`.**
