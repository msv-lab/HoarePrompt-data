Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies that the function does not handle the case when both the real and imaginary parts are zero. Although the annotated code outlines how to compute the phase of a complex number, it does not address that passing `0, 0` into `func_1` would result in a `ValueError`. This situation is indeed an edge case that can arise when obtaining the phase of a complex number. The program's functionality should ideally account for such scenarios; therefore, the original assessment of incorrectness stands.
