The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are numerical values representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`, which is calculated as arctan(imag/real). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two numerical values representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and return the phase of that complex number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `real` and `imag`, which are numerical values, and returns the phase of the complex number defined by these parameters, calculated as arctan(imag/real).**
