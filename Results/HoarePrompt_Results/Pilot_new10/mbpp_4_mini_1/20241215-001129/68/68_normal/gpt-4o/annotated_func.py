#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are numerical values representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase of the complex number formed by 'real' and 'imag', calculated as arctan(imag/real).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two numerical values, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parts and returns its phase (argument), calculated using the `cmath.phase` function. This effectively gives the angle in radians of the complex number in the polar coordinate system. The function correctly handles cases where `real` is zero, and it avoids any division by zero errors since the phase is computed internally using the `cmath` library.
