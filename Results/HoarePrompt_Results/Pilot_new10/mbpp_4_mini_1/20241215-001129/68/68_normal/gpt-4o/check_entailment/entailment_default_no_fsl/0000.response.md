Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the phase (argument) of a complex number formed by the real and imaginary parts provided as input. It uses the `cmath.phase` function, which accurately computes the angle of the complex number in radians, accommodating all quadrants without running into division by zero issues. 

The code handles various cases where:
1. The real part is zero and the imaginary part is non-zero (e.g., `func_1(0, 1j)` and `func_1(0, 2j)`), which correctly returns Ï€/2 (or 1.5707963267948966).
2. Both real and imaginary parts are non-zero (e.g., `func_1(2, 1j)`), which also returns the correct angle.

The provided output hints correctly describe the functionality of the code and confirm that it can handle the specified cases, as well as implies that it covers all the necessary general cases regarding the input range of complex numbers. Since there are no apparent edge cases or reasons where the function would fail to comply with the problem description, the function is considered correct for every potential case.
