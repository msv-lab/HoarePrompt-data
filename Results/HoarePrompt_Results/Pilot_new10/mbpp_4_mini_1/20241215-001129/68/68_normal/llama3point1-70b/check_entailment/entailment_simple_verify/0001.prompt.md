You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number defined by its real and imaginary parts. It uses Python's `cmath` module, which is specifically designed for operations on complex numbers.

Here's how the program works:
1. Takes two inputs: `real` and `imag`.
2. Constructs a complex number using `complex(real, imag)`.
3. Computes the angle of the complex number using `cmath.phase()`, which returns the angle in radians.

The function operates correctly for all potential inputs:
- When both `real` and `imag` are zero, the function will return 0, which is appropriate since the angle is undefined for the origin but conventionally set to 0.
- For positive and negative values of `real` and `imag`, the function correctly computes the angle based on the quadrant in which the complex number lies.

Given this understanding, I found no cases where the function fails to meet the problem requirements. Thus, the implementation is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import cmath

#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are numerical values representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number created from the given real and imag values, which is equal to cmath.phase(complex(real, imag))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
