The provided program, `func_1`, uses the `cmath` module to calculate the phase (angle) of a complex number represented by its real and imaginary parts. The function correctly creates a complex number from the input values and returns the phase using the `cmath.phase` function, which is designed to handle complex numbers accurately.

Output hints state that the function assumes the inputs are valid numerical values and does not handle any edge cases or exceptions. However, the problem description does not specify any constraints on the inputs (for instance, whether they must be integers or floating-point numbers).

Since the `cmath.phase` function can handle valid numerical inputs (including floats and integers) and returns a floating-point representation of the angle in radians, the function indeed meets the problem's requirement to get the angle of a complex number.

Potential edge cases reside in the input validity context (e.g., passing non-numerical inputs). Nonetheless, since the problem description does not specify how to handle invalid inputs or elaborate further than obtaining the angle, we check whether the current implementation satisfies the primary function as defined.

Since the implementation correctly returns the angle of a complex number for expected numerical inputs without any specific requirement to handle exceptions or invalid types, we do not have any example that leads to failure based on the provided description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function fulfills the requirement of calculating the angle of a complex number, as anticipated by the problem description.
