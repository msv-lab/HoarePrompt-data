Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number defined by its real and imaginary parts. It uses Python's `cmath` module, which is specifically designed for operations on complex numbers.

Here's how the program works:
1. Takes two inputs: `real` and `imag`.
2. Constructs a complex number using `complex(real, imag)`.
3. Computes the angle of the complex number using `cmath.phase()`, which returns the angle in radians.

The function operates correctly for all potential inputs:
- When both `real` and `imag` are zero, the function will return 0, which is appropriate since the angle is undefined for the origin but conventionally set to 0.
- For positive and negative values of `real` and `imag`, the function correctly computes the angle based on the quadrant in which the complex number lies.

Given this understanding, I found no cases where the function fails to meet the problem requirements. Thus, the implementation is correct.
