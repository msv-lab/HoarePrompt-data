Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. It uses the `zip` function to pair the elements from both tuples and then calculates the difference for each pair through a generator expression. 

The function will handle various cases correctly, including:
1. Tuples of the same length, which is necessary since element-wise subtraction requires pairs.
2. Tuples with integer elements, floating-point elements, or a combination of both, as the arithmetic operation (subtraction) is valid for those types.

Moreover, if the tuples have unequal lengths, `zip` will stop at the shortest tuple, which is acceptable behavior. Thus, the function meets all expectations outlined in the problem description.
