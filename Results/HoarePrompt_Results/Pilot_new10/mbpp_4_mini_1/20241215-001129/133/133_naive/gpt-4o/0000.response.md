Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the two tuples provided have different lengths. According to the problem description, the behavior in such cases is not specified, leading to an assumption that the tuples must be of equal length for the subtraction to be defined. If the lengths of the tuples are not the same, the `zip` function will only combine the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, which might not be the intended behavior. 

For example, if we call:
```python
func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))
```
This would return `(-2, -2)` because it only processes the first two elements, silently ignoring the third element of the second tuple. 

Thus, the function is missing the necessary logic to account for tuples of unequal lengths, leading to an incorrect implementation.
