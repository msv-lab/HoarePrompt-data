Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths. As per the output hints, the behavior of the function is undefined when the tuples have mismatched lengths, which can lead to unexpected results. For example, if we have `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the code would not raise an error or provide a valid output for this case, leading to incorrect behavior. Thus, since the program fails to correctly handle all potential cases, it is considered incorrect.
