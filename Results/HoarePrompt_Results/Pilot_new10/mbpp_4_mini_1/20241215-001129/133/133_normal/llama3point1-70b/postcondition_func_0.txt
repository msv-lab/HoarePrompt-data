The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which contain numeric elements and are required to be of the same length. It returns a tuple with the differences between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are not of the same length, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle such cases, which could lead to an unexpected result.
