Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the requirements set forth in the problem description. Specifically, the problem description states that the function must subtract corresponding elements of two tuples, but there is a critical issue regarding the handling of input tuples of differing lengths. 

While the program currently assumes that `tup1` and `tup2` are of the same length and that they contain numeric elements, it does not explicitly handle cases where they may not be the same length. In such scenarios, the behavior of the function is undefined because the `zip` function will truncate the longer tuple to match the length of the shorter one, effectively ignoring some elements and potentially leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the lack of validation for tuple length leads to potential unintended outcomes, meaning the implementation does not always align with the problem description requirements.
