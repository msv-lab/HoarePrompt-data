You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its implementation against the problem description, which states that it should subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple at the same index.

The program implementation is as follows:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The function uses the `zip` function to pair the elements of `tup1` and `tup2` based on their index. It then computes the difference for each pair of elements, returning the result as a tuple.

2. **Input Types**: The program ensures that both inputs are tuples. However, there isn't any type validation or handling of cases where the two tuples may have different lengths.

3. **Tuple Length Mismatch**: If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, `zip` will stop at the shortest tuple. This could lead to unexpected behavior when a user expects an error or specific handling for mismatched lengths.

### Example of Potential Issue:
- **Test Case 1**: 
    - Input: `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))`
    - Expected Output: Raises an error or returns a specific message indicating that the tuples must be of equal length.
    - Actual Output: `(1 - 4, 2 - 5)`, resulting in `(-3, -3)`â€”the third element from `tup1` is ignored.

This shows that the function does not handle cases where the tuple lengths differ correctly, as it can lead to loss of information from the longer tuple.

Therefore, due to this issue of ignoring elements of a longer tuple when matched with a shorter tuple, the program does not fully meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which contain numeric elements and are required to be of the same length. It returns a tuple with the differences between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are not of the same length, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle such cases, which could lead to an unexpected result. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
