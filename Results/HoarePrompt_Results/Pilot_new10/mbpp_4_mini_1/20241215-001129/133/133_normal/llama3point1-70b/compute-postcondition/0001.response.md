The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numeric elements. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple that contains the differences of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two tuples of the same length, containing numeric elements, and return a tuple of the differences between the corresponding elements of the two input tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length containing numeric elements, and returns a tuple containing the differences of corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.**
