The provided Python program aims to subtract corresponding elements of two tuples. The function, `func_1`, uses the `zip` function to pair elements from the two input tuples and a generator expression to compute the difference for each pair.

However, the output hints indicate a potential issue: if the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple and will not raise an error. This means that some elements from the longer tuple will be ignored entirely in the result. Additionally, due to this unequal handling, if one tuple is longer than the other, the function does not give a clear indication of this discrepancy to the user, which could lead to confusion.

The provided assertions indicate that the function does perform correctly for cases where the input tuples are of equal length, but the problem description requires the function to handle tuples of potentially different lengths appropriately. Since the error is not explicitly managed in the code and could lead to unexpected output, this constitutes a failure to meet the requirement for all potential cases.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
