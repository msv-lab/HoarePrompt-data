Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it does not handle the case where the input tuples are of different lengths. According to the problem description, the function should perform element-wise subtraction between two tuples of the same length. However, if the tuples provided are not of the same length, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the behavior of the `zip` function, which will only iterate over the shortest input sequence.

This means that if two tuples of different lengths are provided, the function will not execute as intended, and it does not provide a mechanism to manage or report such errors. The assertion tests given in the annotated program assume that valid input will always be provided, which is not guaranteed based on the problem description. 

In summary, while the function effectively performs element-wise subtraction for tuples of the same length, it fails to account for the requirement that tuples must be of the same length, thereby making it incorrect for all potential cases.
