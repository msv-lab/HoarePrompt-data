Final: **True** 

Reason: The annotated version confirms that `func_1` operates correctly under the assumption that valid inputs (tuples of the same length) are provided, which aligns with the initial assessment. The function correctly performs element-wise subtraction for the paired elements of the two tuples. While the original assessment points out the potential issue with tuples of different lengths, the annotation clearly states the assumption that both tuples are the same length when called, validating the correctness of the program within that context. Thus, given valid inputs, the function performs as intended and meets the problem requirements.
