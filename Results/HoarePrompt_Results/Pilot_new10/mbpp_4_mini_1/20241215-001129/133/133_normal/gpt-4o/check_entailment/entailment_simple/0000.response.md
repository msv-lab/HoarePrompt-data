Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1` which takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the corresponding elements of the second tuple. The function uses `zip` to pair the elements of the two tuples based on their indices and then uses a generator expression to perform the subtraction for each pair of elements.

Hereâ€™s how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The function specifically performs subtraction for each pair of elements from `tup1` and `tup2` that have the same index. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

2. **Return Type**: The result is returned as a tuple, maintaining the same structure as the input tuples, which aligns with the expectations set forth in the problem description.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program test various cases and confirm that the output of the function matches the expected outcomes. This demonstrates that the function behaves correctly under the tested scenarios.

Since the function operates on tuples of numeric elements of the same length and returns the correct element-wise differences, it fulfills the requirements given in the problem description, making the implementation correct.
