To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we will analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`. 

The problem description states that we need to split a list for every nth element and return a list of the resulting lists. The provided assertions check various scenarios to ensure that the function is performing as expected.

However, let's analyze an edge case where `n` equals 0. Since Python indexing does not support modulo with zero, calling `i % n` would raise a ZeroDivisionError. This means that for the input `(some_list, 0)`, the function will not handle it properly and will crash.

Given this potential failure case, we can conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where `n` is zero, which results in a division by zero error in the `i % n` expression. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
