To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it correctly implements the functionality of splitting a list for every nth element.

### Problem Description
The task is to create a function that takes a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list for every `nth` element. The expected output is a list of resulting lists.

### Given Program
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analyzing the Program
The code utilizes list comprehension to generate a list of sublists. For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, it takes every `nth` element from the original list `lst` starting from index `i`.

### Test Cases to Consider
1. **Basic Input**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)`
   - Expected Output: `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`
   - Actual Output: `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]` ✔️

2. **n Greater than Length**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2], 5)`
   - Expected Output: `[[], [], [], [], []]` (since starting from index 0 to 4, there are no elements to take)
   - Actual Output: `[[], [], [], [], []]` ✔️

3. **Empty List**: 
   - Input: `func_1([], 3)`
   - Expected Output: `[[], [], []]`
   - Actual Output: `[[], [], []]` ✔️

4. **n = 1**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 1)`
   - Expected Output: `[[1, 2, 3]]`
   - Actual Output: `[[1, 2, 3]]` ✔️

5. **n = 0**: 
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)`
   - This case should ideally return an error since taking every 0th element doesn't make sense.
   - The actual behavior will raise an `IndexError` as the range for `i` becomes `range(0)` and `lst[i::0]` is not valid.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the edge case when `n` is `0`. This results in incorrect behavior and does not meet the problem requirements fully.

Correctness: **False**.
