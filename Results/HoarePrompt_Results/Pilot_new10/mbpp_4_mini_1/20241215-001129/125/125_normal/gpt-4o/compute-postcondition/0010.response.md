Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and it returns a list containing `n` sublists that evenly distribute the elements from `lst` based on their order using modulo `n`. Each sublist corresponds to indices from `lst` that yield the same remainder when divided by `n`. This distribution results in potentially uneven sublists if `len(lst)` is not a multiple of `n`. **
