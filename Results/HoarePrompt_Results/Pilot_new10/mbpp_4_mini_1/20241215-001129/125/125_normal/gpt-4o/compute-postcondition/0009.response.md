The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. The parameter `lst` is a list of elements, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. After executing the function body, the program returns a list `result` which contains `n` sublists, distributing the elements from `lst` evenly based on their order and modulo `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of elements and a positive integer, and return a list containing `n` sublists that evenly distribute the elements from the input list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a positive integer n, returning a list of n sublists that evenly distribute the elements from lst based on their order.**
