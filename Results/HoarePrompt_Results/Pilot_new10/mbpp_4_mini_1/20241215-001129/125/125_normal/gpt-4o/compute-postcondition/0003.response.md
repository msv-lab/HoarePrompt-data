According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `lst` and the `i` variable. If `i` is less than the length of `lst`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, meaning the loop has processed the first element of `lst`. Since `lst` must have at least 1 element, to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 1. 

For the loop to continue, `lst` must have at least 2 elements, and `element` needs to be the second element in `lst`.

State: **`lst` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`**
