Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the behavior specified in the problem description, which is to split a list into sublists for every nth element.

Here's how the program satisfies the requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, which is greater than 0 as stated in the comments.

2. **Splitting Logic**: It uses a list comprehension to create `n` empty sublists. Throughout the iteration over the original list `lst`, elements are assigned to these sublists based on their index. Specifically, the element from `lst` at index `i` is appended to `result[i % n]`. This means that every element of the list is placed in the appropriate sublist according to their positionâ€”effectively distributing the elements evenly across `n` sublists.

3. **Output Format**: The final output is a list of lists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list. This matches the requirement stated in the problem description.

4. **Test Cases**: The test assertions provided check various scenarios, including:
   - Different types of lists (strings and integers).
   - Different values of `n`.
   - They validate that the output correctly groups elements according to the specified splitting criteria.

Since the function satisfies the problem description accurately and has been tested with appropriate cases that confirm its correctness, we conclude that the program works as intended.
