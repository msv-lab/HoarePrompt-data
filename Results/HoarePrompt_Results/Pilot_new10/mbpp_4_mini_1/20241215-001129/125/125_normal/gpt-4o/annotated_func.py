#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is a list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` distributed evenly among them based on their order in `lst`. `result[i]` contains elements from `lst` for indices that yield the same result when `i` is taken modulo `n`.
    return result
    #The program returns the list 'result' which contains 'n' sublists, distributing the elements from 'lst' evenly based on their order and modulo 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and it returns a list containing `n` sublists that evenly distribute the elements from `lst` based on their order using modulo `n`. Each sublist corresponds to indices from `lst` that yield the same remainder when divided by `n`. This distribution results in potentially uneven sublists if `len(lst)` is not a multiple of `n`.
