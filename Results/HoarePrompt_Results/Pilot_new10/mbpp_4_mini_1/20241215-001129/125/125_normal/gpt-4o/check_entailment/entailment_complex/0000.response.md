Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst, n)` takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and splits the list into `n` sublists based on the indices of the elements.

1. The implementation creates `n` sublists initialized as empty lists.
2. It iterates over each element in the input list `lst`, using the index of the element to determine which of the `n` sublists the element should be appended to. This is done using the expression `i % n`, which effectively distributes the elements into the sublists in a round-robin fashion.
3. The final result is a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list `lst`, based on their order.

For any valid input, the function will correctly group the elements according to their index mod `n`, ensuring a proper split of the list for every `nth` element. 

This logic holds true for both even and odd lengths of `lst` compared to `n`, fulfilling all cases outlined by the problem description. Therefore, the function complies with the requirements, and the correctness of the program is confirmed by the assertions present in the annotated program.
