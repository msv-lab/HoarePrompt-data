Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It accepts a list and a positive integer `n`, and it splits the list into `n` sublists based on the indices of the elements. The use of the modulo operation (`i % n`) ensures that elements are distributed into the sublists based on their order in the original list. Each sublist corresponds to all the elements that yield the same remainder when their index is divided by `n`.

The output hints agree with this logic, stating that the function returns a list containing `n` sublists that evenly distribute the elements. The provided assertions effectively validate the function against different cases, confirming that it handles lists of varying lengths, including those that are not multiples of `n`.

Since I did not find any case where the program fails to meet the problem description, the code is correct.
