According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If `lst` is non-empty, the loop will execute and iterate over its elements. Since `n` is given as a positive integer greater than 0, and `result` is already initialized to contain `n` empty lists, this setup is valid for the loop's intended purpose.

At the start of the loop:
- `i` should be 0, which is the starting index of the enumeration.
- `element` should be the first element in `lst`.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `lst` must contain at least 1 element, 
- `i` is 0,
- `element` is the first element in `lst`.

State: **`lst` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`**
