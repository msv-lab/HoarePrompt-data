Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the function is required to split the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. 

However, the implementation uses list comprehension in a way that generates sublists for each starting index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, where each sublist contains every nth element starting from that index. This is not what is meant by splitting the list for every nth element. 

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the expected output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]` as it splits the list into parts taking every 2nd element. However, the program would return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]` but for a different meaning or interpretation of the problem since it generates 2 sublists when the problem only asks to select the n elements. 

Thus, a case where it does not follow the problem description is when `n` is greater than 1, leading the logic to create multiple sublists rather than one well-defined split for every nth element. 

In summary, the program fails to correctly execute the intended operation as outlined in the problem description.
