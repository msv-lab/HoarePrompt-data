You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the implementation provided:

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension that iterates over a range of `n`.
   - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, it extracts elements from the list `lst` starting from index `i` and picking every `n`th element thereafter (slicing).

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - For `n = 3`, given a list like `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, the expected split would be:
     - First list: indices 0, 3, 6 → resulting in `[0, 3, 6]`
     - Second list: indices 1, 4, 7 → resulting in `[1, 4, 7]`
     - Third list: indices 2, 5, 8 → resulting in `[2, 5, 8]`
   - Thus, the final output for this example should be `[[0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8]]`.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will return multiple empty lists depending on `n`. For example, for `lst = [1, 2]` and `n = 5`, the output would be `[[], [], [], [], []]`, which could be considered incorrect as it doesn't appropriately reflect the intention of creating "segments" of the list.
   - If `n` is `0`, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur since the step in slicing cannot be zero. 

4. **Conclusion**:
Given that the function may produce outputs (empty lists) in cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, and it will raise a runtime error if `n` is zero, the program does not handle these edge cases correctly.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails for cases where `n` is greater than the length of the list or when `n` is zero, which are potential input scenarios and do not comply with the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of sublists created by splitting 'lst' into 'n' parts, where each sublist contains every nth element starting from index i for i in the range of n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists created by splitting `lst` into `n` parts. Each sublist contains elements from `lst` at every nth index starting from indices 0 to n-1. Therefore, if `n` exceeds the number of elements in `lst`, the function will still return sublists according to the logic defined, which could lead to some empty sublists if `lst` has fewer elements than `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
