Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the function `func_1`, which filters odd numbers from a list. The reasoning provided highlights that the list comprehension is properly constructed to check for odd numbers using `num % 2 != 0`. 

The annotations confirm that the input to the function is a list of integers and that the function correctly returns a list of all odd integers. The assertions provided also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected across various examples, returning the expected results for valid input scenarios. Since we assume valid input will always be provided to the function, the function can be concluded as correct. Thus, the original assessment stands validated.
