Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The code uses list comprehension to generate a new list that includes only those integers from `nums` that satisfy the condition `num % 2 != 0`, meaning they are odd. According to the output hints, it also correctly returns an empty list if `nums` is empty, as there are no integers to filter. The assertions in the code provide examples that confirm the function behaves as expected, returning the appropriate lists of odd integers for the given test cases. Therefore, it addresses the problem description correctly for every potential case outlined.
