You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to filter odd numbers from a list. However, it is incorrectly defining the condition to filter odd numbers with the expression `num % 2 != 0`. While this condition does correctly identify odd numbers, the problem description does not specify how to handle cases where the input list is empty.

For an input case like `func_1([])`, the expected output should be an empty list `[]`, which the program does correctly return. However, if we extend the scenarios to consider negative odd numbers or very large integers, the program still performs as expected. 

However, the program does not handle the case where non-integer types (like strings or None) could be present in the input list. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 'a', None])` would raise an error during the modulus operation, demonstrating that the program does not account for non-integer inputs, thus making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a list containing all odd integers from that list. If `nums` is empty, the function returns an empty list. There are no additional edge cases related to the list contents since it simply filters for odd numbers without error handling for non-integer types. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
