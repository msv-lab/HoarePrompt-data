You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to filter odd numbers, but it only filters out the odd numbers and returns them while ignoring the even numbers. However, it does not return anything when there are no odd numbers in the input, which could be misleading. 

For example, consider the input:
```python
func_1([2, 4, 6])
```
The expected output should ideally indicate that there are no odd numbers, which would typically be an empty list `[]`. However, the program does work correctly in this case because the list comprehension will simply return an empty list, which means the intended “filtering” might be interpreted as incorrect per the description unless specified otherwise. 

Another point to consider is that if the input list contains negative odd numbers, they are correctly included, which is expected behavior. But again, if the input list had mixed odd and even values, the program simply returns the odd numbers.

Since the program does not clarify how it handles other cases, such as inputs without any odd numbers (which it does correctly but might not specify in output expectations), the potential lack of clarity and edge cases makes the program incorrect for the given description. 

So, while the basic functionality might seem correct, it does not fully meet the expectations given the problem description regarding handling of all potential inputs adequately.

Thus, the conclusion is:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of all odd integers from the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a list containing all odd integers from that list. If `nums` is empty, the function returns an empty list. There are no additional edge cases related to the list contents since it simply filters for odd numbers without error handling for non-integer types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
