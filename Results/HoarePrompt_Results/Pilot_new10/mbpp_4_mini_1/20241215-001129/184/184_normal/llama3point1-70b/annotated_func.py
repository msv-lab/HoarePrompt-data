#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of all odd integers from the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a list containing all odd integers from that list. If `nums` is empty, the function returns an empty list. There are no additional edge cases related to the list contents since it simply filters for odd numbers without error handling for non-integer types.
