Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. However, while it does correctly return odd integers when the input is a valid list of integers, it lacks error handling for non-integer types that might be present in the input list. In case there is a non-integer element (e.g., a string or a float), it could raise a `TypeError`, as these types do not support the modulo operation. Therefore, the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically those involving non-integer types within the list.
