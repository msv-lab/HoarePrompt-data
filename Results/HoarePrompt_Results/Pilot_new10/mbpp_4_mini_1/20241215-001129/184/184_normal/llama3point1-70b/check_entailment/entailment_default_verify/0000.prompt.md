You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to filter odd numbers, but it only filters out the odd numbers and returns them while ignoring the even numbers. However, it does not return anything when there are no odd numbers in the input, which could be misleading. 

For example, consider the input:
```python
func_1([2, 4, 6])
```
The expected output should ideally indicate that there are no odd numbers, which would typically be an empty list `[]`. However, the program does work correctly in this case because the list comprehension will simply return an empty list, which means the intended “filtering” might be interpreted as incorrect per the description unless specified otherwise. 

Another point to consider is that if the input list contains negative odd numbers, they are correctly included, which is expected behavior. But again, if the input list had mixed odd and even values, the program simply returns the odd numbers.

Since the program does not clarify how it handles other cases, such as inputs without any odd numbers (which it does correctly but might not specify in output expectations), the potential lack of clarity and edge cases makes the program incorrect for the given description. 

So, while the basic functionality might seem correct, it does not fully meet the expectations given the problem description regarding handling of all potential inputs adequately.

Thus, the conclusion is:
Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a list containing all odd integers from that list. If `nums` is empty, the function returns an empty list. There are no additional edge cases related to the list contents since it simply filters for odd numbers without error handling for non-integer types. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
