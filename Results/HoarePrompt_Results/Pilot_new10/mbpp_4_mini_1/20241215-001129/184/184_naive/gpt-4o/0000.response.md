Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to filter out odd numbers from a list. It uses a list comprehension that iterates through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that are odd, identified by `num % 2 != 0`.

The assertions provided also check several test cases where the input lists contain both odd and even numbers, and they match the expected output of odd numbers:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` correctly returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` correctly returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` correctly returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

Since no potential cases were found where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, the implementation is confirmed to be correct.
