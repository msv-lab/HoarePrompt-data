Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but it fails to account for the requirement in the problem description to remove all whitespaces, not just spaces. The function `func_1(s)` only removes space characters and does not handle other whitespace characters like tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`). Therefore, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem as demonstrated in the example provided in the original assessment. The annotations confirm that the function only removes spaces, leading to the conclusion that the original assessment was not accurate. Thus, the final evaluation of the program should be marked as incorrect.
