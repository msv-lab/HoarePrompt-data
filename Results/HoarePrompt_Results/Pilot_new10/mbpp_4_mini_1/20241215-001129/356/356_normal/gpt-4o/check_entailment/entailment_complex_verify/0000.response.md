Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the program is correct. However, the problem description clearly requires the program to remove all whitespaces from a string, which includes not just spaces but also other whitespace characters such as tabs and new lines. The provided function `func_1(s)` only removes spaces (' ') and does not account for other types of whitespace. As a result, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, making the original assessment inaccurate.
