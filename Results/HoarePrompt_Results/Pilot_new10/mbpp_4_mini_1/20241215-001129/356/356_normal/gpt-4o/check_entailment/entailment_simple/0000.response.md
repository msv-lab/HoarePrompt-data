Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to remove all whitespaces from a string, but the implementation only removes single spaces by replacing them with an empty string using `s.replace(' ', '')`. This method does not account for other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or multiple consecutive spaces.

For instance, if the input string contains a tab character (e.g., `'python\tprogram'`), the program would not remove the tab, resulting in `'python\tprogram'` instead of the expected `'pythonprogram'`. Therefore, the implementation fails to meet the requirement of removing all types of whitespace characters from the string.

To fully satisfy the problem description, the function should use a method that removes all types of whitespace, such as using `''.join(s.split())` or utilizing a regular expression with `re.sub(r'\s+', '', s)`. 

Thus, the implementation does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case.
