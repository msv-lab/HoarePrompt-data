The provided function `func_1` is designed to remove all whitespace from a given string `input_str`. The logic employed in the code utilizes the `replace` method to eliminate spaces specifically.

Output hints mention that the function handles any string scenarios, including those that are entirely composed of spaces or empty, indicating that the function should return an empty string in such cases.

Upon analyzing the function, we find the following considerations:

1. **Functionality**: The method `input_str.replace(' ', '')` is effective in removing all spaces (' ') from the string, but it only targets space characters specifically. It does not account for other types of whitespace, such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or other Unicode whitespace characters.
  
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - An input string that contains tabs or other whitespace characters will not have those characters removed, which violates the problem description's expectation to remove "all whitespaces" from a string. For example, for an input of `"\t Hello \n World \t"`, the output would still include the tab and newline characters, which does not meet the requirements.
   - The output hints suggest that even an input containing only spaces or being empty would produce an empty string, which is consistent with what the code does. However, for inputs with other whitespace characters, the output isn't as described.

Given these aspects, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it fails to handle all possible whitespace cases.

Correctness: **False**.
