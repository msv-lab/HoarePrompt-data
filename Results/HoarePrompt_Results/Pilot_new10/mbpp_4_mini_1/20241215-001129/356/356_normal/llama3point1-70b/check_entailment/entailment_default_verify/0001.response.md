Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate as it points out that the function only removes spaces and does not handle other whitespace characters like tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`). According to the problem description, which requires removing all types of whitespace, the function implementation fails to meet this requirement. The output hints do not contradict this; they simply reiterate that the function only removes spaces and does not address the handling of other whitespace characters. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect in the context of the problem's requirements.
