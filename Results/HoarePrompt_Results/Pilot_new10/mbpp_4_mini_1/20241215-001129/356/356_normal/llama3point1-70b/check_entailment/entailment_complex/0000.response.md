Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to remove all whitespaces from a string. 

Here's why it is correct:
1. The function `func_1` takes a string `input_str` as an argument.
2. It uses the `replace` method on the string to replace all occurrences of the space character (' ') with an empty string ('').
3. The operation effectively removes all spaces from the input string, thus returning the correct result.
4. It covers all scenarios, including:
   - Strings with multiple spaces: All spaces are removed.
   - Strings containing no spaces: The output will be the same as the input.
   - Empty strings: An empty string will return an empty string, which is the expected outcome.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality as required by the problem description, ensuring all whitespace is removed from the provided string.
