Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases of whitespace removal as stated in the problem description. It only replaces single spaces (' ') with an empty string ('') but does not account for other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs ('\t') or newlines ('\n'). 

For example, if the input string is:

```python
'python\tprogram'
```

or 

```python
'python\nprogram'
```

the expected output should still be `'pythonprogram'`, but the current implementation would retain the tab or newline characters. Therefore, since there are cases where the program does not fulfill the requirement of removing all whitespaces, the correctness is deemed false.
