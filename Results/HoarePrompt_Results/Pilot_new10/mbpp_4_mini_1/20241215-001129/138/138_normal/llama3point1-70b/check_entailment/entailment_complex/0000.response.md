Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `array` (a list of elements) and `element` (which can be of any type). This aligns with the problem specification.

2. **Element Search**: The function correctly attempts to find the index of `element` in `array` using `array.index(element)`. If the `element` is present in the `array`, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the `element`. This satisfies the part of the problem description that states if the element is found, it should return a boolean indicating presence (True) and the index position.

3. **Handling Non-Existent Element**: The function uses a `try-except` block to handle the situation where `element` is not found within `array`. In this case, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns a tuple `(False, -1)`, which is consistent with the requirement to return `False` and `-1` when the element cannot be found.

4. **No Empty Array Handling Needed**: The problem description does not specify handling for empty arrays explicitly. The function correctly returns `(False, -1)` if searching in an empty list since `array.index(element)` would raise a `ValueError`, thus conforming to the behavior expected by the problem description.

Overall, the logic is consistent, handling both scenarios (element found or not found) correctly as per the stated requirements. Therefore, the program accurately implements the functionality described in the prompt.
