Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `array` and an `element` of any type, and attempts to find the index of the element within the array. If the element is found, it returns True and the index of the element; if the element is not found, it returns False and -1. It does not handle cases where the array is empty, but the logic remains consistent in the current implementation. **
