The program could raise a `ValueError` if the specified `element` is not present in the `array`. If the `element` is found, the `index` method will return its position in the `array`, and the function will return `True` along with the `index`. If the `element` is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, and the function returns `False` and -1 to indicate the absence of the `element`.

Therefore, the output state is: **`array` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any type. If the `element` is found, the function returns True and the index of the element; otherwise, it returns False and -1.**
