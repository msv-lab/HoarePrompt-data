The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `element`. `array` is a list of elements, and `element` can be of any type that may be present in the array. If the `element` is found within the `array`, the function returns `True` along with the index of the `element`. If the `element` is not found, the function returns `False` and -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of elements and an `element`, returning whether the `element` is present in the list and its index, or indicating its absence. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of elements and an element of any type, returning True and the index of the element if it is found, or False and -1 if it is not found.**
