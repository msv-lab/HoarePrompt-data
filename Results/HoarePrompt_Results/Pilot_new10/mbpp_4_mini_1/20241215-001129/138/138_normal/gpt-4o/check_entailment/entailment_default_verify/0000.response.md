Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement: it takes an array and an element, checks if the element is present in the array, and returns a tuple that indicates the presence of the element and its index. The test cases provided confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs.

The output hint does mention a potential confusion regarding the search being limited to the first three indices; however, it does not affect the correctness of the implementation itself. The function explicitly searches through the entire array and returns the correct results as indicated by the output hints. Therefore, all specified requirements of the problem description are met for any potential valid input.
