Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly adhere to the problem description since it does not specify any limitation on the indices to be searched. The output hints clarify that it does not limit the search to the first three indices, which may imply there has been a misunderstanding regarding the requirements. However, it correctly finds an element if it occurs in the list, but the mention of "contrary to what is stated in the annotations" indicates a lack of clarity or correctness based on potential documentation or assumptions.

To illustrate a failure case: if the input array is empty, `func_1([], 31)` would return `(False, -1)`, which is correct behavior based on the requirement but the hints suggest a confusion regarding the index searching limitations which was not provided in the initial problem description. Hence, the contradiction in hint and function behavior leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect overall.
