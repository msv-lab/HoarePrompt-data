The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function returns `True` with the index of the first occurrence of the element if found, otherwise it returns `False` and `-1`. 

However, the annotations make a critical statement: "The function does not limit the search to the first three indices, contrary to what is stated in the annotations." This implies that there might have been confusion in understanding the requirements as it suggests that it's returning None for ambiguous cases, though the function is designed to return a definitive tuple for all valid inputs.

Upon reviewing both the problem description and the provided annotated states, I conclude:

1. The function accurately searches through the entire list for any element.
2. It fulfills the requirement of returning a tuple indicating whether the element is found and the appropriate index or `-1` if not found.

Despite the confusion in the annotations, the primary functionality of the function still adheres to the problem description provided from the onset. Since there are no issues with how it processes, given that valid inputs are always assumed.

Based on the analysis and the understanding of the implementation against the problem description, I do believe the original assessment is still accurate.

Final: **True**
