The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. `arr` is a list, and `element` can be of any data type. After executing the function body, the function will return different outputs based on the position of `element` in `arr`. 

- If `element` is equal to the first element of `arr`, it returns `True` and the index `0`.
- If `element` is equal to the second element of `arr`, it returns `True` and the index `1`.
- If `element` is equal to the third element of `arr`, it returns `True` and the index `2`.
- If `element` is not found in `arr`, it returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, returning `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr` if it is found within the first three indices; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1` indicating that the `element` is not present in `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`, returns `True` and the index of `element` if found within the first three indices of `arr`; otherwise, it returns `False` and -1.**
