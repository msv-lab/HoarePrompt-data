Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly meets the problem description requirements by checking if the specified element is present in the provided array and returning a tuple with a boolean indicating presence along with the index of the element. 

The assertions provided in the program confirm its expected behavior. Here's a breakdown:

1. The function uses `enumerate` to iterate over the array, which gives both the index and the value of each element.
2. If the value matches the specified element, it returns `(True, index)` for that elementâ€™s index.
3. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`, indicating that the element is not found in the array.

Consideration for edge cases:
- If the array is empty, `func_1([], element)` will correctly return `(False, -1)`.
- If the element is not present in the array, it will also return `(False, -1)` as required.
- If there are duplicates, it returns the index of the first occurrence, which is the correct behavior.

Since all test cases work as expected and the function properly handles cases such as an empty list and the absence of the element, I confirm that the implementation is correct.
