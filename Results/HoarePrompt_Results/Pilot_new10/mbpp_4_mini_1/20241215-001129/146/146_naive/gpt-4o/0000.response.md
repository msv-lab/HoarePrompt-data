Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. However, the provided program does not handle the case where there are multiple lists of the same maximum length. For example, given the input `[[1, 2], [3], [4, 5], [6]]`, the expected output should be `(2, [1, 2])` as it's the first list with the maximum length of 2. 

However, if two lists have the same maximum length, the function will always return the last one it encounters, without indicating any specific preference or tie-breaking mechanism, which may not align with typical expectations of how such a function should behave. 

Hereâ€™s a failed case:
- Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`, the expected output should be `(2, [1, 2])` or `(2, [3, 4])`, but the actual implementation will return only the last processed maximum length list, which in this case would return `(2, [3, 4])`. 

This highlights that the function does not behave correctly for this case and thus is considered incorrect.
