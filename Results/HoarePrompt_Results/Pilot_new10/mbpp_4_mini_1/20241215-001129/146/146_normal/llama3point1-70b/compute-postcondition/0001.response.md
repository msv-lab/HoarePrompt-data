The code creates a new list `max_sublists` that contains only those sublists from `list_of_lists` whose lengths are equal to `max_len`. The value of `max_len` defines the maximum length to filter the sublists, but the exact contents of `max_sublists` depend on the content of `list_of_lists`.

Thus, we retain the initial state for `list_of_lists` and `max_len`, but now we also have a new list `max_sublists` derived from this filtering process. The previous values of `list_of_lists` and `max_len` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of varying lengths; `max_len` is the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`; `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` that have length equal to `max_len`.**
