You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the implementation. 

**Problem description**: The task is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

**Program analysis**:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```

### Steps of the program:
1. It calculates `max_len`, the length of the longest sublist in the given `list_of_lists`.
2. It builds a list `max_sublists` containing all the sublists that have this maximum length.
3. It returns a tuple containing `max_len` and the first sublist from `max_sublists`.

### Potential cases to consider:
1. **Empty input list**: If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max()` would throw a `ValueError` because the function does not have any elements to compare.
2. **Multiple lists of maximum length**: The function only returns the first sublist of maximum length. If the requirement is to return all lists of maximum length, then this does not satisfy that condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the presence of the case where an empty list leads to an error demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails if the input list is empty, resulting in an exception rather than a valid output, which does not meet the expectations outlined in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns two values: the maximum length of the sublists within the list and the first sublist that has this maximum length. If the input list is empty or contains only empty sublists, it could raise a `ValueError` when attempting to find the maximum length, and therefore should be handled. The function does not account for the case when all sublists are empty, which would result in an error. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
