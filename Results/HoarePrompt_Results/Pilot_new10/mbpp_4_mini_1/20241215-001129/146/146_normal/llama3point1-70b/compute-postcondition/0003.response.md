The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, each of which can be of varying lengths. After executing the function body, the function returns the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists` and the first sublist from `list_of_lists` that contains sublists of that maximum length. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of lists and return the maximum length of the sublists and the first sublist that has that maximum length. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns the maximum length of the sublists and the first sublist from list_of_lists that has that maximum length.**
