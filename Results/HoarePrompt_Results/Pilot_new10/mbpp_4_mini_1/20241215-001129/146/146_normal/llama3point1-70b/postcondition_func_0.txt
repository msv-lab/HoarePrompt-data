The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns two values: the maximum length of the sublists within the list and the first sublist that has this maximum length. If the input list is empty or contains only empty sublists, it could raise a `ValueError` when attempting to find the maximum length, and therefore should be handled. The function does not account for the case when all sublists are empty, which would result in an error.
