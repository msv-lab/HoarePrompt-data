You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == (3, [13, 15, 17])
assert func_1([[1], [5, 7], [10, 12, 14, 15]]) == (4, [10, 12, 14, 15])
assert func_1([[5], [15, 20, 25]]) == (3, [15, 20, 25])

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. However, the provided program does not handle the case where there are multiple lists of the same maximum length. For example, given the input `[[1, 2], [3], [4, 5], [6]]`, the expected output should be `(2, [1, 2])` as it's the first list with the maximum length of 2. 

However, if two lists have the same maximum length, the function will always return the last one it encounters, without indicating any specific preference or tie-breaking mechanism, which may not align with typical expectations of how such a function should behave. 

Hereâ€™s a failed case:
- Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`, the expected output should be `(2, [1, 2])` or `(2, [3, 4])`, but the actual implementation will return only the last processed maximum length list, which in this case would return `(2, [3, 4])`. 

This highlights that the function does not behave correctly for this case and thus is considered incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of sublists `list_of_lists`, iterates through them to find the longest sublist, and returns the length of that longest sublist along with the longest sublist itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns 0 for the length and an empty list for the longest sublist. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
