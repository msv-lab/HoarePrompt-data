According to the code, the loop iterates over `list_of_lists`. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` is 0 while `max_list` is an empty list. For the loop to execute one more time, it must process the next sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

If `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists, the next value of `lst` will be the third sublist. Therefore, to execute the loop again, we need to consider that `lst` must be updated to the third sublist.

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
