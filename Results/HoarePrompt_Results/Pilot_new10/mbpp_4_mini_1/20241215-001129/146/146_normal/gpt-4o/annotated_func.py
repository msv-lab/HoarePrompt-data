#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can contain any type of elements.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: max_len is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, max_list is that longest sublist, `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then max_len is 0, and max_list is an empty list.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns max_len, which is the length of the longest sublist in list_of_lists, and max_list, which is that longest sublist. If list_of_lists is empty, then max_len is 0 and max_list is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of sublists `list_of_lists`, iterates through them to find the longest sublist, and returns the length of that longest sublist along with the longest sublist itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns 0 for the length and an empty list for the longest sublist.
