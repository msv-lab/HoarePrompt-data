Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to find the longest sublist within a list of lists. It initializes two variables: `max_len` to keep track of the maximum length found so far, and `max_list` to store the corresponding sublist. As it iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, if it finds a longer sublist than `max_len`, it updates both `max_len` and `max_list`. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself.

The output hints state that if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return `(0, [])`, which is a potential edge case that needs to be checked. However, the current implementation does not address the situation where `list_of_lists` is empty, as the initial values of `max_len` (0) and `max_list` (an empty list) will be returned without any checks. 

Thus this would lead to incorrect behavior when the input is an empty list of lists.

Correctness: **False**.
