According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list, which does not interfere with the loop execution itself. 

For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 sublist. The variable `lst` will represent the first sublist in that case.

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
