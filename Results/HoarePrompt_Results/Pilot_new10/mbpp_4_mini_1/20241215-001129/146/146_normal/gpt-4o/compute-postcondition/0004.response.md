`max_len` is assigned the value of the length of `lst`. Since the length of `lst` is greater than 0, `max_len` will now be a positive integer. The state of `max_list` and `list_of_lists` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_len` is now a positive integer (equal to the length of `lst`), `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, and `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`max_len` is a positive integer equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, and `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
