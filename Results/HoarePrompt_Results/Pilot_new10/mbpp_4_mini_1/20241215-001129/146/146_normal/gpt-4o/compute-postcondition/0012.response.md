`max_len` is assigned the value of the length of `lst`. Since `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, the length of `lst` will be determined by the specific contents of that sublist. The initial state of `max_list` remains unchanged, and the current state does not affect it. Thus, the output state must reflect the change in `max_len` while maintaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
