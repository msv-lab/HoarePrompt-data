Final: **False**. 

The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not handle the case where there are multiple sublists of the same maximum length. The function `func_1` will return the last list it encounters with that maximum length instead of indicating a preference among equally long sublists. This behavior does not align with typical expectations for a function designed to find the longest sublist. The output hints confirm that the function seeks to find the longest sublist but do not address the issue of tie-breaking. Therefore, the program's correctness is compromised for inputs where the maximum-length lists are not unique.
