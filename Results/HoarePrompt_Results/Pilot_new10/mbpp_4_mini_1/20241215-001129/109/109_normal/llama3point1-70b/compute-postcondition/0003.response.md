In this scenario, `list1` is assigned the reference of `list2`. Since `list1` was initially an empty list, after the assignment, `list1` will reference the same list as `list2`, whatever its content may be.

The impact of the code is that `list1` now holds the same reference as `list2`, so any modifications to `list2` will also reflect in `list1` and vice versa. The state of `list1` changes, while `list2` retains whatever state it had prior to the assignment.

Output State: **`list1` is now referencing `list2`, and `list1` and `list2` are the same list.**
