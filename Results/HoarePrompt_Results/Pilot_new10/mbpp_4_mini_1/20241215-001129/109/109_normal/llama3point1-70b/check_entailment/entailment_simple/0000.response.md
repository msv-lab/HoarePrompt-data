Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully comply with the problem description. The problem clearly states that the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. However, the implementation does not accomplish this correctly in all cases.

1. When accessing `list1[-1:]`, this creates a slice of the last element of `list1`, instead of replacing just the last element. The slicing syntax (`list1[-1:]`) results in a list containing the last element rather than directly referencing or replacing it. This means the program does not replace just the last element but rather potentially creates a sublist, which does not correct it.

2. If `list1` is empty (although the comment specifies it must have at least one element), the code attempts to reassign `list1 = list2`, which does not modify the original `list1` outside of the function's scope. This behavior violates the requirement that `list1` should always reflect the changes.

To specifically clarify:
- The use of slicing does not fulfill the goal of replacing just the last element.
- There is ambiguity in handling the case where `list1` might be empty, even if it is stated to have at least one element.

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirement of the problem description correctly for all scenarios.
