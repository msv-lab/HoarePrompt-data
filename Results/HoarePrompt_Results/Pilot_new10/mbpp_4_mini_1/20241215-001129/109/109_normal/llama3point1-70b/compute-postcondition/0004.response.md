Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are both lists. If `list1` contains elements, the last element of `list1` is replaced by the contents of `list2`. If `list1` is empty (but since `list1` has at least one element, this scenario does not occur), then `list1` references `list2`, making them the same list.***
