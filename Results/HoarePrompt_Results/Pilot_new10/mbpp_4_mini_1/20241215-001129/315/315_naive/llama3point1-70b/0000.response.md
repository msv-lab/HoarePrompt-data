Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly adheres to the problem description, which requires adding a given tuple to a specified list. It achieves this by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the input list. 

This approach works for all potential cases, including:
1. If `input_list` is empty, the result will be just the converted tuple as a list.
2. If `input_tuple` is empty, the original list is returned unchanged.
3. If both `input_list` and `input_tuple` are non-empty, their contents are concatenated properly.

No edge cases are overlooked, and the function performs as expected in all scenarios.
