#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list, and input_tuple is a tuple.
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    #The program returns a new list that is the concatenation of 'input_list' and the elements of 'input_tuple' converted to a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and the elements of `input_tuple` converted to a list. No edge cases or errors are handled, such as validating the input types. The function assumes both inputs are of the correct type (list and tuple).
