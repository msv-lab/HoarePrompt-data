Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and it returns a new list that is a concatenation of the original list and the elements of the tuple converted to a list. 

To break it down:

1. The function's parameter names (`lst` and `tpl`) align with the requirements, indicating that the first parameter is a list and the second is a tuple.
2. The operation `lst + list(tpl)` successfully combines the elements of the list and the tuple. This ensures that all elements from the tuple are added to the end of the list, as required.
3. The use of `list(tpl)` converts the tuple into a list format that can be appended directly to the existing list.

The assertions provided further confirm that the function behaves correctly under various test scenarios, producing the expected output for each case. Since the program consistently adheres to the problem requirements, we can conclude that it is correct.
