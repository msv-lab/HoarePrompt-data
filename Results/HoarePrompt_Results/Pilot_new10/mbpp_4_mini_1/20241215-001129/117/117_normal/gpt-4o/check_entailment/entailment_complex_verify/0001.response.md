Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness was accurate. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly identifies and counts the integer elements in the list provided, which aligns with the problem description. The annotated code further confirms that the function handles various types of inputs while focusing solely on integer elements. It correctly summarizes that the program yields the count of integers, returning zero if no integers exist. Therefore, the overall functionality meets the requirements stated in the problem description, and the assertions provided validate the correctness of the function.
