You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

def func_1(lst):
    return sum((1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the given problem description, let's analyze it.

### Problem Description:
Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

### Provided Program:
```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

def func_1(lst):
    return sum((1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1(lst)` uses a generator expression to check each element in the list `lst` to see if it is an instance of an integer (`isinstance(x, int)`), and it sums the number of `True` results (which are counted as `1`).

2. **Example Assertions**:
   - The first assertion checks a list with two integers: `1` and `2`, which is expected to return `2`. 
   - The second assertion checks a list of three integers: `1`, `2`, and `3`, which correctly returns `3`.
   - The third assertion with `1, 1.2, 4, 5.1` contains only one integer (`4`), but the assertion states it should yield `2`, which is incorrect.

### Potential Error Case:
The third assertion is incorrect. It states that `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` should return `2`, but there is only one integer in this list, which is `4`. Therefore, the function should return `1`.

### Conclusion:
Since at least one input case fails to match the expected outcome, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements within that list. It does not consider elements of any other type, and can handle lists containing mixed types, including empty lists, gracefully by returning a count of zero if no integers are present. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
