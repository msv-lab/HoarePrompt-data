The provided Python function `func_1(lst)` is intended to count the number of integer elements in a given list `lst`. The original assessment states that the program is correct and that it accurately counts integer elements while handling different types appropriately.

Upon reviewing the assertions:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns `2` correctly.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `3` correctly.
3. `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` returns `2` correctly.

Moreover, the output hints clarify that the function handles mixed types and returns zero for no integers present, which aligns with how the function is designed.

Considering these points:
- The original assessment concludes that the function handles the task as intended, counting integers correctly.
- The output hints also support this conclusion, confirming the function's expected behavior.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate, and the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description without any unnoticed flaws.

Final: **True**
