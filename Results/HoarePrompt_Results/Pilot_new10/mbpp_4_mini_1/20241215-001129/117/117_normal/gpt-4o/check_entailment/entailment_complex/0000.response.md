Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately counts the number of integer elements in a given list, as required by the problem description. 

Here's how it fulfills the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(lst)` accepts a list `lst`, which can contain elements of various types, including integers, floats, strings, etc.

2. **Integer Identification**: Inside the function, the line `sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))` utilizes a generator expression that iterates through each element in the list and checks if the element is of type `int`. This ensures that only integer elements are counted.

3. **Counting Mechanism**: The generator expression produces a count of `1` for each integer found in the list, and the `sum()` function totals these counts to give the final result.

4. **Correctness Against Tests**: The assertions provided (e.g., `assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2`) validate that the function is returning the expected number of integer elements for different lists. The tests confirm that the function behaves correctly with a variety of inputs, including those with mixed types.

5. **Handling Empty and Mixed-Type Lists**: The function will return `0` if there are no integer elements, which correctly handles the scenario of empty lists or lists without any integers.

Overall, the implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description, performing the task of counting integer elements in the list as specified.
