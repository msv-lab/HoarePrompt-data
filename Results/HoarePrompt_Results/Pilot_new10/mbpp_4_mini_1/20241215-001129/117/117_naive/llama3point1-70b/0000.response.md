Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression that checks if each element is an instance of `int`. It sums up the total number of `True` results, which are equivalent to the number of integer elements in the list. The function handles lists with different types of elements, including mixed types (e.g., floats, strings, etc.), and returns the expected count accurately. It correctly returns 0 for an empty list as well. Therefore, I cannot find any edge cases where it would fail based on the description provided.
