According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` needs to have at least one more element beyond the current iteration. Currently, since `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, this means that after the last iteration, it has at least 1 element remaining. 

Assuming that the last element of `nested_list` was processed during the previous iteration, `i` would then take the value of that last element. For the loop to execute the next time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements (including the current one being processed) and `i` will take the next element in the loop.

Thus, if the loop has processed one element already, `nested_list` must contain at least 3 elements, and `i` will become the next element (the next one in the list). 

State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 3 elements, `flat_list` is accordingly modified, and `i` is the next element in the list.**
