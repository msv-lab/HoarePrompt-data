The code `flat_list.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to `flat_list`. Since `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is not of type list, this operation will add `i` directly to `flat_list` without any further modification or iteration. The other variables' states remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list`, `i` is not of type list, `flat_list` now contains the value of `i` appended to it.**
