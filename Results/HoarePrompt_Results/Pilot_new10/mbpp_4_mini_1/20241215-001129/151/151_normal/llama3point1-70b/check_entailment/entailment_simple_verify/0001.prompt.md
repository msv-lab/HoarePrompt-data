You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a recursive approach to flatten a nested list structure. 

### Explanation:
1. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input.
2. It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to hold the flattened elements.
3. It iterates over each element `i` in the `nested_list`.
   - If the element `i` is itself a list, the function calls itself recursively (`func_1(i)`) to flatten that sub-list and extends `flat_list` with the resulting elements.
   - If the element `i` is not a list, it gets appended directly to `flat_list`.
4. Finally, the function returns the flattened list.

The program correctly handles all types of nested lists, including:
- An empty list: `func_1([])` results in `[]`.
- Flat lists: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` results in `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Nested lists of various depths: `func_1([1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6])` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Additionally, it handles edge cases like:
- Mixed data types, such as `func_1([1, 'a', [2.5, [True, [None]]]])` which results in `[1, 'a', 2.5, True, None]`.

Since the function correctly flattens any form of nested list without missing any scenarios, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers or other lists, potentially nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` is a flattened version of `nested_list`, containing all integers from `nested_list` and any nested lists within it, with `nested_list` being a list that may contain any number of elements. If `nested_list` is empty, then `flat_list` remains empty.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns the flattened version of `nested_list`, which is `flat_list`, containing all integers from `nested_list` and any nested lists within it. If `nested_list` is empty, then `flat_list` remains empty.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
