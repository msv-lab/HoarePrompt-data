`i` is appended to `flat_list`. The variable `nested_list` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is the next element in the list, so `flat_list` will now include this next element. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 2 elements; `i` is the next element in the list; `flat_list` has `i` appended to it.**
