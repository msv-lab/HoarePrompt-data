Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Nested List Handling**: The function `func_1` iterates through each element in the input `nested_list`. It checks the type of each element.
   - If the element is a list (which indicates it may contain more integers or other lists), it calls itself recursively (`func_1(i)`) to flatten that sublist.
   - If the element is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), it appends the element directly to `flat_list`.

2. **Recursive Approach**: By using recursion, the function can handle lists that are nested to any depth. Each level of nesting is managed by the recursive calls, so all integers in the structure—regardless of their depth—are eventually added to `flat_list`.

3. **Empty Lists**: The function handles the case where `nested_list` is empty. If `nested_list` is empty, the for loop is skipped, and the empty `flat_list` is returned as required.

Thus, the function adheres to the problem's requirements of returning a flattened version of the nested list, irrespective of the structure's complexity or depth. It effectively combines the results of any nested lists and accounts for all possible cases defined in the problem description.
