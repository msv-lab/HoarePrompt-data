Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description by recursively flattening a nested list structure into a single flat list. Hereâ€™s an explanation of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `nested_list`, which is indeed intended to be a list that may contain integers or other lists, potentially nested to any depth.

2. **Iteration and Recursion**: The function uses a for loop to iterate over each element in `nested_list`. For each element:
   - If the element is a list, the function calls itself recursively on that element (`func_1(i)`), which correctly handles nested lists of any depth.
   - If the element is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), it appends that element to `flat_list`.

3. **Constructing the Flat List**: The method of using `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` for nested lists ensures that all elements from the nested structure are included in the final output. Conversely, `flat_list.append(i)` ensures that integers directly in `nested_list` get added.

4. **Empty List Handling**: If `nested_list` is empty, the function will exit the for loop without adding anything to `flat_list`, resulting in an empty `flat_list`, which is also the required behavior as mentioned in the problem description.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns `flat_list`, fulfilling the requirement to return a flattened version of the input list.

The program is written such that every potential case of a nested list structure is handled correctly, maintaining the integrity of the data type and yielding the expected outcome in all scenarios. Thus, it is correct in accordance with the problem description.
