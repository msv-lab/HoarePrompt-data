Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements a recursive approach to flatten a nested list structure as described in the problem statement. The output hints support this by indicating that the function handles various cases of nested lists and returns an empty list appropriately when the input is empty or contains no integers. The assessment thoroughly covers the edge cases, confirming that the implementation works for all valid inputs. Since the logic of the program aligns with the problem requirements and the output hints do not present any conflicting scenarios, the program is deemed correct.
