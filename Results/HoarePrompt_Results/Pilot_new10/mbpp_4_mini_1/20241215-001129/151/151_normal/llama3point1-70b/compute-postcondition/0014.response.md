Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list containing at least 3 elements. If `i` is a list, `flat_list` is modified by appending the result of `func_1(i)` and `i` is the next element of `nested_list`. Otherwise, `flat_list` is modified to include one more element equal to `i`, and `i` is the next element in the list.***
