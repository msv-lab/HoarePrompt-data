Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` uses recursion to traverse each element of the input list (`nested_list`). It checks if each element is itself a list using `isinstance(item, list)`:
   - If it is a list, it recursively flattens that list by calling `func_1(item)` and extends the `flat_list` with the result.
   - If it is not a list, it appends the element directly to `flat_list`.

2. **Preservation of Order**: The elements are added to `flat_list` in the order they are encountered. This ensures that the order of elements in the original nested list is preserved in the flattened result.

3. **Handles Any Level of Nesting**: Since the function calls itself for each sublist, it can handle nested lists at any level, fulfilling the requirement to flatten any nested structure.

4. **Empty List Handling**: If `nested_list` is empty, the for loop does not execute, and the function returns an empty `flat_list`, which is the expected outcome.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions test various scenarios, including:
   - A mixture of integers in nested and flat formats.
   - Multiple nested lists.
   - Completely flat structures.
   All test cases return the expected results, indicating the function behaves as required.

In conclusion, the function `func_1` fulfills all aspects of the problem description to flatten a nested list structure, hence the Correctness is **True**.
