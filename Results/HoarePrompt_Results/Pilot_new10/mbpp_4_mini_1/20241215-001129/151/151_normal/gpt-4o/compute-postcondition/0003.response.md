The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` indicates that `flat_list` will now include all elements returned by `func_1(item)`, where `item` is the first element of `nested_list`, which is itself a list. The output state will reflect the new value of `flat_list`. However, since the precise return value of `func_1(item)` is not known, we cannot specify what it is, but we know `flat_list` will contain whatever that function returns.

The variables `nested_list` remains a non-empty list, `item` is still defined as the first element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` will now include the contents extended by the output of `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list, `item` is the first element of `nested_list` which is a list, `flat_list` includes the contents returned by `func_1(item)`.**
