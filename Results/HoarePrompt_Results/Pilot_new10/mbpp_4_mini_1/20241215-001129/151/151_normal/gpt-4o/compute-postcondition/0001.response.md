According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the `nested_list` is not empty, the loop will execute. At the start, the loop variable `item` will be assigned to the first element in the `nested_list` if it exists. Given that `flat_list` is empty before the loop starts, it does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `nested_list` must not be empty and `item` should be the first element of the `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must not be empty, `item` is the first element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` is an empty list**
