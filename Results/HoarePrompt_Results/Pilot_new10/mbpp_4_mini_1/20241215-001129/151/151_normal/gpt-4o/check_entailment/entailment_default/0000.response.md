The program is designed to flatten a nested list structure, which may include integers or deeply nested lists. Let's analyze the code in relation to the problem description and the output hints.

The function `func_1` uses recursion to traverse each item in the input list `nested_list`:

1. It initializes an empty list `flat_list`.
2. For each item in `nested_list`:
   - If the item is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that item and extends `flat_list` with the result.
   - If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to `flat_list`.
3. Finally, the function returns the `flat_list`.

### Output hints examination:
- The hints correctly describe that the function will flatten any list structure that may contain non-list elements or lists nested at any level.
- It can correctly flatten lists and also preserves the order of elements.
- If `nested_list` is empty, the output will also be an empty list.

### Test Cases Verification:
The assertions provided are:
1. `func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]])` correctly flattens to `[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]`.
2. `func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]])` correctly returns `[10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]`.
3. `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]])` correctly results in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]`.

All these outputs match the expected outputs outlined in the problem description and the output hints.

### Potential Edge Cases:
The function seems to accommodate all typical cases for flattening nested lists. It handles empty lists and deeply nested structures effectively, as confirmed through the sample assertions. There are no missed scenarios that could lead to incorrect outputs, such as missing levels of nesting or misunderstanding of element types.

### Conclusion:
Since the function appears to correctly implement the requirements from the problem description for all cases considered, we conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
