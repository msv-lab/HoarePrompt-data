In this code snippet, the `flat_list` is extended by the result of calling `func_1` on the `item` variable, which is the next item in the `nested_list`. The `nested_list` is a non-empty list with at least one more item, implying that `item` is defined and valid for processing. Since the function `func_1` generates a new output from `item`, this signifies that `flat_list` will incorporate these elements.

We don't have the specific values for `item` or `flat_list`, but we know that `flat_list` is being modified by adding elements generated by `func_1(item)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list with at least 1 more item; `item` is the next item in `nested_list`, and `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)`.**
