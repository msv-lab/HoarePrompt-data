Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` correctly implements a recursive approach to flatten a nested list structure. It checks if each element in the `nested_list` is a list and, if so, recursively flattens it before appending the elements to `flat_list`. The program successfully handles various cases, including:

1. Lists containing integers, strings, or other data types.
2. Nested lists of varying depths.
3. Empty lists, which would yield an empty flat list.

For example:
- Calling `func_1([1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]])` would return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the expected flattened output.
- Calling `func_1([])` would return `[]`, which is also correct.

Since the function handles all potential edge cases and provides the correct output for the problem description, it is considered correct.
