Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1(arr)` is intended to determine whether an array of integers contains any duplicate elements. However, the logic used in the function is reversed. The function returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are not. 

1. When `len(arr) != len(set(arr))`, it indicates that there are duplicates (the original array is longer than the set of unique elements).
2. The problem description requires a function that simply checks for duplicates and should return `True` if duplicates exist and `False` otherwise.

Thus, calling `func_1([1, 2, 2])` would incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`, and `func_1([1, 2, 3])` would incorrectly return `False` instead of `True`. These inconsistencies violate the problem's requirements. Therefore, since the function does not meet the problem description's needs for all potential cases, the correctness is **False**.
