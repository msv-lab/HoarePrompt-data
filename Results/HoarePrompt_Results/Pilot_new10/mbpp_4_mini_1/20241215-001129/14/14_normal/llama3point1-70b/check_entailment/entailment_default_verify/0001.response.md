The original assessment states that the function `func_1(arr)` does not correctly determine if there are duplicate elements in the array because it asserts that the function's logic is reversed. According to the assessment, the function is supposed to return `True` when duplicates exist and `False` otherwise. Therefore, when `len(arr) != len(set(arr))`, which indicates duplicates, it should return `True`, not `False`.

However, the output hints clarify that the function actually does what it is intended to do: it accepts a list of integers and returns `True` if there are duplicate integers in the list and `False` if there are none. This aligns with the problem description that requires identifying the presence of duplicates.

Based on the output hints, the function's implementation is consistent with its intended functionality and conforms to the requirements outlined in the problem description. The original assessment that claimed the function's correctness was **False** contradicts the output hints and does not accurately reflect the function's logic.

Thus, the original assessment is not accurate. Therefore, I conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
