Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the function `func_1(arr)` incorrectly behaves in accordance with the problem description. The function is intended to return `True` if duplicates exist and `False` otherwise. However, the function actually returns `True` when there are duplicates (as indicated by `len(arr) != len(set(arr))`), which is the opposite of what is required. The annotations confirm the understanding of the program's behavior, reiterating that the function returns a value indicative of the presence of duplicates. Therefore, the assessment that the function's correctness is **False** remains valid.
