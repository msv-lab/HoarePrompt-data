Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately correspond to the problem description. According to the problem, the function should return `True` if there are duplicate integers in the input array and `False` if there are no duplicates. However, the implementation actually returns `True` for arrays with duplicates and `False` for arrays without duplicates, which is not the expected behavior.

For example:
- For the input `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, the function wrongly returns `False` instead of `True` because it checks for duplicates incorrectly.
- For the input `arr = [1, 1, 2]`, it returns `True`, which is correct, but it does not encompass the necessary condition of returning `True` for the presence of duplicates as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the function does not behave correctly for all potential cases.
