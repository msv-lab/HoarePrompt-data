Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should determine whether the array contains any duplicate elements. Therefore, the function should return `True` if duplicates are found and `False` otherwise.

However, the current implementation of the function `func_1(arr)` contains a logical error in its return statement. The expression `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` evaluates to `True` when there are duplicates (because the set would have fewer elements than the original array), but it also returns `False` when there are no duplicates, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior outlined in the problem description.

In summary, the function 'func_1' should return `True` when duplicates are present and `False` otherwise, but it currently returns the inverse of that. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirement given in the problem description.
