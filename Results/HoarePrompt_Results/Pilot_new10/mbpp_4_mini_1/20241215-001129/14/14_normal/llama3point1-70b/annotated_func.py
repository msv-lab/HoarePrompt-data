#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
    #The program returns True if there are duplicate integers in the list 'arr', and False otherwise, based on the comparison of the length of 'arr' and the length of the set of unique integers from 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns `True` if there are duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns `False`. It effectively checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set created from that list, which contains only unique elements. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the code, as it correctly handles all cases of duplicate values in the input list.
