According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list `arr` contains at least one integer, then the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `seen` is an empty set, which does not influence the loop's execution directly. Hence, for the loop to be executed, the `arr` must contain at least 1 integer, and `num` is set to the first integer in the `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list**
