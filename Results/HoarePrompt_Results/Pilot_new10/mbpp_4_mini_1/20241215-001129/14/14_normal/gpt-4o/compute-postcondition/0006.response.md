According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop executes again for the second integer. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, where `num` is the first integer in the list and is now in the set `seen`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 integers, and `num` must be updated to the second integer in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, and `num` is now in the set `seen`.**
