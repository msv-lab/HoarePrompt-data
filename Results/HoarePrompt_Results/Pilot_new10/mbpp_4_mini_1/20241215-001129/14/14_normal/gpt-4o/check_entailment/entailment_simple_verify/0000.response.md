Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(arr)` indeed correctly identifies duplicate elements in an array of integers. The annotated version confirms that the state of the program is coherent with the intended functionality. Each time a number is encountered, it checks if the number is in the `seen` set, and if so, it returns `True`, indicating a duplicate is present. 

Moreover, if no duplicates are found, it correctly returns `False`. The function was tested with various cases that demonstrate its correctness as per the problem description. Therefore, I believe the program is correct.
