The variable `num` is added to the set `seen`. Since `num` was previously stated to not be in `seen`, it will now be included in the set. The values of `arr` and `num` remain unchanged, as they are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, and `num` is now in the set `seen`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, and `num` is now in the set `seen`.**
