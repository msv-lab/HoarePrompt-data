Correctness: **False**.

The provided program checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the original array `arr` with the length of a set created from that array. However, the program returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are not, which is opposite to what we would typically expect. 

For example, with the input `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, it would return `False` (indicating no duplicates) as `len(arr)` equals `len(set(arr))`. However, in terms of the function's naming and typical logic, one would expect a function named `contains_duplicates` to return `True` if duplicates are present. 

Thus, for the input `[1, 2, 2, 4]`, it would return `True` which would mean duplicates exist, as expected, but the return value's meaning can be confusing. Hence, even though the logic identifies the duplicates correctly, the expected output should align with typical interpretations, which the function does not fulfill correctly.
