Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(arr)` correctly identifies duplicate elements in an array of integers. It uses a set to keep track of the seen numbers. For each number in the array, if the number already exists in the set, it returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate has been found. If no duplicates are found after checking all numbers, it returns `False`. 

The provided test cases also confirm the correctness:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `False`, indicating no duplicates.
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, it returns `True` as the number `4` appears twice.
- For the input `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`, it returns `True` since `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` are all duplicates.

Since the function works correctly for all test cases and adheres to the problem description, the conclusion is that it is indeed correct.
