Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary based on the condition that the values must be greater than or equal to the integer `n`. 

The implementation utilizes dictionary comprehension to iterate through the provided dictionary `d`, retaining only those key-value pairs where the value `v` meets the condition `v >= n`. 

The assertions provided in the program demonstrate its correctness through several test cases:

1. For input `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` with `n = 170`, the expected output is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is correctly matched.
   
2. For input `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` with `n = 180`, the expected output is `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is also correct.
   
3. For input `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` with `n = 190`, the expected output is `{'Pierre Cox': 190}` which is accurately returned.

Moreover, the function effectively handles edge cases where:
- All values are below `n`, resulting in an empty dictionary.
- The dictionary is empty, where it also correctly returns an empty dictionary regardless of `n`.

Since every potential case considered works as expected and meets the provided problem description, the program is deemed correct.
