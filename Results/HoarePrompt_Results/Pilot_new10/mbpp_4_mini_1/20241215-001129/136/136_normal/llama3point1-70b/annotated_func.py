#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with any hashable type as keys and integers as values, n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing the keys from 'd' with values that are greater than or equal to the integer 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` with hashable keys and integer values, along with an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. If no values meet this criterion, the function will return an empty dictionary.
