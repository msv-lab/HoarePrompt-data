Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Function Signature and Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, as required by the problem statement.

2. **Dictionary Comprehension**: The program uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over each key-value pair in `d`. The condition `if v >= n` ensures that only those entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n` are included in the output dictionary.

3. **Return Value**: The return statement produces a new dictionary that contains only the filtered key-value pairs. If no values in the dictionary meet the criterion (i.e., all values are less than `n`), the program will correctly return an empty dictionary, which is an expected outcome as per the problem description.

4. **Correctness for All Cases**: The implementation correctly handles the case where the dictionary has different integers or is empty. If no values satisfy the condition, the function returns an empty dictionary, aligning with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Therefore, since the program behaves as described and produces the correct output for all relevant cases, it is indeed correct.
