Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(d, n)` correctly implements the requirement of filtering a dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the provided integer `n`. The annotations confirm that the function returns a dictionary with the appropriate criteria in place (`v >= n`). Furthermore, the test cases provided align with the expected behavior of the function, demonstrating that it performs correctly across various scenarios. Assuming valid input as stated, the program fulfills its intended purpose without issue.
