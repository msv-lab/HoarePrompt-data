Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of filtering a dictionary based on the values in accordance with the problem description. It uses dictionary comprehension to iterate over all key-value pairs and includes only those pairs where the value is greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. 

The output hints confirm this behavior, specifying that the function returns a new dictionary with only the qualifying entries, or an empty dictionary if there are no qualifying entries. This aligns perfectly with the problem description and demonstrates that the function handles the expected cases appropriately, including edge cases (like an empty dictionary).

Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem statement in all potential cases.
