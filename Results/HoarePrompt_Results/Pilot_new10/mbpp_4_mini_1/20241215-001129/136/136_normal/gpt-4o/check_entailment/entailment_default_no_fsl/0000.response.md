Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(d: dict, n: int) -> dict` accurately filters the dictionary `d` to include only those entries with values that are greater than or equal to the integer `n`. The implementation uses a dictionary comprehension which is a valid approach to creating a new dictionary based on the conditions specified.

The provided assertions test the function against various cases:
1. For `n = 170`, the expected output correctly includes entries with values 175, 180, and 190.
2. For `n = 180`, the expected output contains entries with values 180 and 190.
3. For `n = 190`, the expected output contains only the entry with the value 190.

Additionally, the output hints confirm that if the dictionary `d` is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary, which matches the expected behavior as well.

Since the function meets the problem description for all mentioned and potential cases, the correct output for this assessment is True.
