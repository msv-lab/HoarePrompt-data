Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters a dictionary according to the specified criteria, returning a new dictionary containing only entries where the values are greater than or equal to the integer `n`.

The output hints corroborate this conclusion, emphasizing that the function accepts a dictionary with integer values and behaves as expected, including returning an empty dictionary when the input dictionary is empty. The function passes all the provided assertions, demonstrating its correctness across various test cases, which confirms that it adheres to the problem requirements.

All these factors lead to the definitive conclusion that the original assessment was justified.
