Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly filters the input dictionary according to the specified condition of retaining only those entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function processes the input dictionary correctly and produces the expected output for the provided test cases. Each test demonstrates that the function behaves as intended, confirming its correctness with valid input as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements, and the initial assessment of its correctness remains valid.
