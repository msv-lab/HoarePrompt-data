Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(d, n)` takes in two parameters: a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The line `return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` accurately filters the dictionary as required. It iterates over all key-value pairs in the input dictionary and checks whether the value `v` is greater than or equal to the threshold `n`. If the condition holds true, that pair is included in the new dictionary.

3. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as intended for various inputs:
   - For input `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` with `n = 170`, the output correctly includes only those entries with values of 175, 180, and 190.
   - Similarly, other assertions test different thresholds and confirm that the relevant entries are returned, validating the filtering logic.

4. **Completeness**: The function will work for any dictionary and integer input, consistent with the provided problem statement. It gracefully handles any valid input, ensuring that only applicable key-value pairs are returned.

Thus, the function adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description, confirming its correctness.
