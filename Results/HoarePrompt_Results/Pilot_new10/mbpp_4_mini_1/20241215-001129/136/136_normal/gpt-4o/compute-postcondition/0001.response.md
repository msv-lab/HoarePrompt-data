The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `d` and `n`. The parameter `d` is a dictionary whose keys are of any immutable type and whose values are integers. The parameter `n` is an integer. After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary where the keys are from the input dictionary `d`, and the values are the integers from `d` that are greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter the dictionary `d` so that only the keys associated with values that are greater than or equal to the integer `n` are included in the resulting dictionary. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary d and an integer n, returning a dictionary with keys from d where the associated values are greater than or equal to n.**
