Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` properly filters a given dictionary based on the criteria specified in the problem description. The output hints clarify that the function is designed to retain dictionary entries where the values are greater than or equal to a provided integer `n`. The implemented logic using dictionary comprehension is both efficient and succinct, ensuring that it meets the requirements.

Additionally, the assertions provided serve as effective test cases that cover various scenarios, including edge cases with different values of `n`. The function's design handles cases where the dictionary may be empty by returning an empty dictionary, which aligns with the expectation outlined in the output hints. Therefore, all functionality is correct, and the conclusion of the original assessment holds true.
