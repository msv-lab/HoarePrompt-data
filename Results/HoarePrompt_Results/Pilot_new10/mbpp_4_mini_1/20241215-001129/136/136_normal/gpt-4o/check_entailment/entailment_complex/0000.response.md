Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

- The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a dictionary `d` where the keys are of any immutable type and the values are integers, and an integer `n`.
- It constructs a new dictionary using a dictionary comprehension that filters the entries of `d`. Specifically, it includes only those entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
- The comments accurately describe the inputs and outputs of the function, ensuring that the function's behavior matches the described requirements.
- The assertions provided in the annotated program test various cases, confirming that the function correctly filters the dictionary based on the given threshold `n`.

Across all scenarios tested, including edge cases (like when all values are below `n`), the function performs as specified by the problem description. If `d` is empty, it returns an empty dictionary, which is also consistent with the requirements.

Thus, the function satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem description perfectly.
