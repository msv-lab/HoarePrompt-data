Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly filters entries in the dictionary based on the specified integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to include only those entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. The assertions provided test various cases, including:

1. When `n` is 170, it correctly retains entries with heights 175, 180, and 190, omitting 165.
2. When `n` is 180, it retains entries with heights 180 and 190, omitting heights 175 and 165.
3. When `n` is 190, it only retains the entry with height 190, omitting all others.

All edge cases and potential cases are handled correctly, so the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. There is no case that I can envision where it would fail to meet the requirements. Thus, I confirm that the code is correct.
