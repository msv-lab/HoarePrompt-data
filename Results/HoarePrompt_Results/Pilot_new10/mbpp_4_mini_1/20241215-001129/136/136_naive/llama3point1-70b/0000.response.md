Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary `d` to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to the integer `n`. The dictionary comprehension iterates over all key-value pairs in the dictionary, performing the comparison for each value. Since it handles all potential inputs and edge cases (including an empty dictionary or negative values of `n`), the function operates as described in the problem statement. 

For example:
- For an input dictionary `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}` and `n = 2`, the result would be `{'b': 2, 'c': 3}`, which is the expected behavior.
- For an empty dictionary `{}` and any `n`, the output would remain `{}`, which is also correct behavior.

Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem statement in all potential cases.
