Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times within the string. According to the problem description, the requirement is to find all occurrences and positions of the substrings, but the provided implementation only finds the first occurrence and returns it. 

For example, if the input is `string = "abcabc"` and `substring = "abc"`, the expected behavior would be to return both occurrences, but the function only returns the first one:

```python
func_1("abcabc", "abc")  # Expected output: [('abc', 0, 2), ('abc', 3, 5)]
```

In this case, the program fails to meet the requirement of returning all occurrences and their positions, making it incorrect.
