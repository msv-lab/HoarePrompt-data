Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the substring appears multiple times in the main string. According to the problem description, it is expected to find and return the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string, which implies that if a substring is found multiple times, there should be a mechanism to capture and report the latest or all occurrences. 

For example, if we call `func_1('python programming, python programming', 'python')`, the correct output should ideally account for all occurrences, but the current function only finds and returns the first occurrence. Hence, it won't meet the specified requirements of the problem description. 

Thus, the function is incomplete in addressing all potential cases, confirming it as incorrect.
