Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the substring appears multiple times in the main string. The problem description explicitly states that the function is expected to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string, which implies returning all occurrences. The function, as it currently stands, only returns the first occurrence of the substring and would fail to meet the expectations outlined in the problem description when multiple occurrences exist.

Since the problem description demands handling all occurrences and the function only handles the first, the function is indeed incomplete and incorrect in fulfilling the requirements specified. Therefore, the original assessment accurately reflects the limitations of the implementation in regard to the problem description.
