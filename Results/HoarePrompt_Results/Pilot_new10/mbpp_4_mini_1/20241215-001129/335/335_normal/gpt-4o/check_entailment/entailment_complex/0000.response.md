The provided program is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a given string, returning `None` if the substring is not found. Let's analyze the correctness of the program based on the specified problem description.

1. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` receives two parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string`.
   - It uses `main_string.find(sub_string)` to determine the starting position of the `sub_string` within the `main_string`. If the substring is not found, `find` returns `-1`.
   - If `start_pos` is `-1`, the function correctly returns `None`, as required by the problem description.
   - If the substring is found, the function calculates `end_pos` by adding the length of `sub_string` to `start_pos` and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and its end position.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The assertions test various scenarios:
     - **First assertion**: Checks for the substring 'python' in a string containing it and outputs the expected tuple.
     - **Second assertion**: Tests for 'programming' and returns the correct tuple.
     - **Third assertion**: Looks for 'language' which is also found, returning the appropriate tuple.
     - **Fourth assertion**: Searches for 'python' in a string that does not contain it, correctly returning `None`.

3. **Edge Case Considerations**:
   - The function assumes that `sub_string` is always non-empty (as stated in the comments). It also doesnâ€™t account for multiple occurrences of the substring; it only finds the first occurrence.
   - However, the problem description only requires finding *an* occurrence and it does not specify handling multiple occurrences or whether handling of substrings of length 0 should be considered.

Given this analysis, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description based on the specifications and returns accurate results for the provided tests.

Correctness: **True**
