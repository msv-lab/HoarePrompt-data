Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not handle multiple occurrences of a substring within the main string. The function `func_1` only finds the first occurrence of the substring and properly returns its position, but it fails to return subsequent occurrences, which is a clear requirement according to the problem description stating that it should find the occurrence and position of substrings. 

The annotations also confirm that while the function behaves correctly for the first occurrence, it does not meet the requirement to provide information about subsequent occurrences. Therefore, despite the accurate identification of handling initial occurrences, the lack of handling multiple occurrences in the implementation aligns with the reasoning of the original assessment being correct.
