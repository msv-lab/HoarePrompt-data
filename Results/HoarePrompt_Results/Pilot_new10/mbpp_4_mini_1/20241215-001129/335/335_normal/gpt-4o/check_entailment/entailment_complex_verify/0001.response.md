Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified that the program is incomplete in handling multiple occurrences of the substring within the main string. The problem description explicitly states the need to find the occurrence and position of substrings, which implies that multiple occurrences should be reported if they exist. Since the program only detects the first occurrence, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. 

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program is functional for finding the first match, but it fails to meet the complete requirements by not considering multiple occurrences. Thus, maintaining that the program is incorrect is justified.
