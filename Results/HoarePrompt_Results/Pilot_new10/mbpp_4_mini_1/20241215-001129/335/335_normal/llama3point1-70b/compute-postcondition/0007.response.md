Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string and a non-empty substring and checks whether the substring exists within the string. If the substring is found, it returns the substring along with its starting index and ending index within the string. If the substring is not found, it returns None. There are no checks in place for the case where the substring is the same length as the string or if it appears multiple times; the function only reports the first occurrence. **
