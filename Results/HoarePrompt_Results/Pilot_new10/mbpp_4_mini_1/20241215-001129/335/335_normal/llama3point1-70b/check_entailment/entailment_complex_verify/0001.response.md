Final: **False**

The original assessment highlights the program's failure to handle multiple occurrences of the substring within the string, accurately reflecting the requirements outlined in the problem description. The annotated code confirms this assessment by clearly indicating that while the program checks for the presence of a substring and returns the first occurrence and its indices, it lacks logic to iterate through the string for additional matches. Therefore, the original assessment is justified as the program does not meet the specification of finding all occurrences and their respective positions, making it incorrect according to the problem's requirements.
