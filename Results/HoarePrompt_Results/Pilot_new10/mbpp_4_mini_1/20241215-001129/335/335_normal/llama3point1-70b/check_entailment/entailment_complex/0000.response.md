Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly matches the problem description, which requires a function to find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string and return None if there is no match.

Here's why the program meets the specifications:

1. **Input Requirements**: The function accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`, both of which are specified to be non-empty. The substring is also constrained to be shorter than or equal to the string, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

2. **Finding the Substring**: The function uses `string.find(substring)`, which efficiently locates the first occurrence of the `substring` within the `string`. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to find occurrences.

3. **Returning None for No Match**: If the `substring` is not found (i.e., `find` returns -1), the function correctly returns `None`, fulfilling the part of the requirement that specifies returning None for no match.

4. **Returning Position Information**: If the `substring` is found, the function calculates and returns the substring itself along with its starting and ending indexes. The starting index is provided directly by the `find` method, and the ending index is calculated as the length of `substring` added to the starting index minus one. This gives the correct position range of the found substring.

5. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: While the function only reports the first occurrence of the substring, this is implicitly allowed in the problem description, which does not require reporting all occurrences. Thus, it meets the stated objective.

Overall, the function behaves as required by the problem description, correctly handling cases for finding a substring and reporting its position or returning None if the substring is absent. Therefore, the program is correct.
