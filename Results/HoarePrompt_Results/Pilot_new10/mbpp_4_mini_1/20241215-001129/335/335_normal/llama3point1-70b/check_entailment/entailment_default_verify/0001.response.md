Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fulfill the requirement to find all occurrences and positions of the substrings in the input string. The output hints confirm the behavior of the function, indicating that it only returns the first occurrence, which contradicts the problem description that specifies returning all matches. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specifications outlined in the problem description, making it incorrect.
