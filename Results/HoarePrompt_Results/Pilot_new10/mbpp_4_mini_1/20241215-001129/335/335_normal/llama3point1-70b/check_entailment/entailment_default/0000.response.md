Explanation: The code is not correct as it does not handle cases where the substring may appear more than once within the string. The problem description specifies that the function should find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string, yet the implementation only captures the first occurrence. Additionally, there are no checks for cases where the substring is the same length as the string, nor does it account for the possibility of the substring being empty. Therefore, the output hints are corroborated by the code's limitations.

Correctness: **False**.
