The provided program aims to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a given string. Let's analyze the program against the problem description.

1. **Input Assumptions**: The function `func_1` takes two inputs: `string` and `substring`. The problem states that both are non-empty strings and that `substring` is at least as short as `string`. The program correctly assumes these conditions.

2. **Finding the Substring**: The program uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of `substring` in `string`. If the substring is not found, `find` returns `-1`. The program checks this condition and appropriately returns `None` if no match is found. This fulfills the requirement to return `None` when there are no occurrences of the substring.

3. **Returning the Result**: If the substring is found, the program calculates the starting index and the ending index (exclusive) of the substring in the string, returning a tuple with the substring, the start index, and the end index. This aligns with the need to provide the positions of the substring.

4. **Output Behavior**: The program handles the case where the substring is not present properly and provides the correct positional information when it is present.

All these checks confirm that the program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description for all potential cases. 

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
