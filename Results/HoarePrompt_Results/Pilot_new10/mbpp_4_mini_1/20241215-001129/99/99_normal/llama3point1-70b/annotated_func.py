#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of characters.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join(s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))
    #The program returns a new string consisting of every second character from the string 's', starting with the first character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string that consists of every second character from `s`, starting with the first character. If `s` is empty, it returns an empty string.
