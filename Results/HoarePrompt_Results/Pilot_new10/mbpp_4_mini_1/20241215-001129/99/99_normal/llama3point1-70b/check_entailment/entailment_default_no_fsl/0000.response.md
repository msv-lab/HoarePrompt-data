Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires a function that removes characters with odd index values, but the provided code does the opposite: it retains characters at even index values (0, 2, 4, ...). 

For example:
- For the input string "abcdef", the expected output should be "bdf" (removing characters at indices 1, 3, 5), but the program instead produces "ace" (retaining the characters at indices 0, 2, 4).

This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, it is incorrect.
