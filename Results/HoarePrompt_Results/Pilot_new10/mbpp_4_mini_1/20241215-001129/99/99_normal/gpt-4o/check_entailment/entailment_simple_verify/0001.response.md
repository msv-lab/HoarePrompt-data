Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The problem description correctly specifies the requirement to remove characters from a string that have odd index values, and the function `func_1` properly implements this requirement by returning the characters at even indices. The provided annotations confirm that at each stage of execution, the function behaves as expected. 

The test cases validate various lengths and contents of strings, confirming that the implementation works accurately. For all provided examples, the function produces the correct outputs, matching the expected values. The reasoning provided in the original assessment about the correctness of the implementation remains valid upon review of the annotated code, which clearly states the behavior of the function and its compliance with the problem description. Thus, the conclusion of correctness holds.
