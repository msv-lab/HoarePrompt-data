Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the required functionality of removing characters from a string that have odd indices. The function `func_1` constructs a new string by including only the characters located at even indices of the input string `s`. The assertions in the code demonstrate that it correctly handles several test cases, confirming its correctness for these examples.

Additionally, the output hints affirm that if the input string `s` is empty, the function will appropriately return an empty string, which is consistent with the requirements. Hence, I believe the function behaves correctly for every potential case outlined in the problem description.
