Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the requirement to remove characters from a given string that have odd index values. The function `func_1` successfully constructs a new string consisting of characters that are at even indices. The provided test cases verify the functionality for different string lengths and cases. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, including returning an empty string when the input is also an empty string. There are no overlooked edge cases, and the implementation aligns with the problem description, reaffirming the conclusion that the correctness is True.
