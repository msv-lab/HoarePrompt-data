Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to remove characters with odd index values from a given string by only including characters found at even indices. The annotated version of the code supports this by clearly stating that the function returns a new string composed of characters from the original string 's' at even indices. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for different string lengths and cases, further validating that the implementation is indeed correct according to the problem description. Thus, the overall conclusion about the correctness of the program remains True.
