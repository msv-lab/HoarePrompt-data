Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. The problem specifically asks for a function that removes characters with odd index values from a given string, meaning it should return a string that contains only the characters located at odd indices. 

However, according to the implementation in the function `func_1`, it returns characters located at even indices instead. Therefore, it does the opposite of what was required. 

For instance:
- For the input `'abcdef'`, the expected output should be `'bdf'` (characters at odd indices), but the function returns `'ace'` (characters at even indices).
- For the input `'python'`, the expected output should be `'yhn'`, but the function returns `'pto'`.

Since the function does not adhere to the problem statement, it is deemed incorrect.
