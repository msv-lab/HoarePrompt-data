Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly removes the characters from a given string that have odd index values. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string and includes only those characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.). 

The test cases provided confirm the correctness of the implementation:

- For the string `'abcdef'`, the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 'a', 'c', and 'e', resulting in the output `'ace'`.
- For the string `'python'`, the characters at even indices are 'p', 't', and 'o', resulting in the output `'pto'`.
- For the string `'data'`, the characters at even indices are 'd' and 't', resulting in the output `'dt'`.
- For the string `'lambs'`, the characters at even indices are 'l', 'm', and 's', resulting in the output `'lms'`.

These test cases cover different lengths of strings and ensure that characters are correctly included or excluded based on their index values. No edge cases were overlooked, and the implementation works as described for all potential cases in the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is True.
