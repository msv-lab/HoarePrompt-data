Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to remove characters from a string that have odd index values. It uses a list comprehension that iterates through the string's indices with a step of 2, effectively selecting characters located at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.).

Here are the key points verifying its correctness:

1. **Even Index Selection**: The program generates a new string that consists only of characters at even indices by using `range(0, len(s), 2)`, ensuring that all characters at odd indices are excluded.

2. **String Handling**: The function handles all types of strings, including empty strings and those with any combination of characters. For an empty string, it correctly returns an empty string, as there are no characters to process.

3. **Examples**:
   - Input: "abcdef" → Output: "ace" (characters at indices 0, 2, and 4).
   - Input: "123456789" → Output: "13579" (characters at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8).
   - Input: "" (empty string) → Output: "" (still an empty string).

Given these considerations, the program behaves as expected in all scenarios described in the problem statement. Therefore, the code is correct.
