To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation of `func_1`.

**Problem Description**: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

**Program Analysis**: 
1. The function `func_1` takes an input `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple containing multiple tuples.
2. It calculates the average for each position of the inner tuples:
   - It first calculates the number of elements in any of the inner tuples using `num_elements = len(tuples[0])`.
   - It initializes an empty list `averages` to store the results.
   - For each position `i`, it collects all `i`-th elements from each inner tuple into the list `elements_at_position`.
   - It computes the average of this list using `avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and appends it to the averages list.

**Potential edge cases** that could break the implementation:
- If the inner tuples are of different lengths. The current implementation assumes all inner tuples are of the same length (`len(tuples[0])`). If they aren't, `elements_at_position` will result in an `IndexError` for any tuple that has fewer elements than the others.

Let's consider a test case:
```python
tuple_of_tuples = ((1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6,))
```
In this case, the first tuple has 2 elements, the second tuple has 3 elements, and the last tuple has only 1 element. If we try to execute `func_1(tuple_of_tuples)`, it would raise an `IndexError` during the list comprehension on line 7 when it attempts to access the index `i` in the tuples of different lengths.

Because of this, the program does not handle all potential cases as specified by the problem description.

Given this analysis:

Correctness: **False** 

The provided function does not correctly handle cases where the inner tuples are of different lengths. This invalidates its correctness according to the problem description.
