Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly highlighted a significant issue with the program: it does not handle the edge case of an empty tuple of tuples, resulting in a potential division by zero error. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function is designed to compute averages based on positions, but it fails to safeguard against the possibility of receiving an empty input. 

Since we must consider the robustness of the program against various inputs as stated in the problem description—including edge cases—the assessment's conclusion of "False" remains valid. The annotated version does not negate the correctness concerns raised in the original assessment but rather reinforces the idea that the program needs improvements to be robust under all circumstances defined by the problem description.
