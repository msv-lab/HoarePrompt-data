Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input `tuples` is empty. According to the problem description, the function should compute the average of corresponding values from each tuple. If an empty tuple is provided, the computation `sum(val) / len(tuples)` will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which violates the requirement of correctly processing all potential cases.

Thus, the function fails to meet the problem description because it does not return a valid result (average list) for an empty input, making it incorrect.
