Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of tuples containing numeric values and returns a list of averages for each numeric position across all inner tuples. However, if the input is an empty tuple, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when attempting to compute the average, as it will attempt to divide by zero when calculating the length of 'tuples'. Thus, the function does not handle the case where the input 'tuples' is empty. **
