Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which requires computing the averages of each corresponding position in a tuple of tuples. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric values.

2. **Calculation of Averages**:
   - The expression `zip(*tuples)` effectively transposes the input tuple of tuples, grouping values by their corresponding indices. For example, given `tuples = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, `zip(*tuples)` would yield `((1, 3, 5), (2, 4, 6))`.
   - The list comprehension iterates over these groups, where for each grouped set of values (e.g., `(1, 3, 5)`), it calculates the average using `sum(val) / len(tuples)`. The use of `len(tuples)` provides the count of inner tuples, ensuring that the average is computed correctly.

3. **Output Structure**: The function returns a list containing the averages of each group of corresponding values, aligning perfectly with the requirement in the problem description which asks for a list of averages.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - The implementation handles an arbitrary number of inner tuples as long as they contain numeric values. 
   - If all values in a position are the same, the average will simply return that same value.
   - If there are variations in the numbers, it will correctly calculate their average.

Overall, the logic and operations performed by the function are accurate and align with the problem requirements. Thus, it is correct in its implementation for all cases described in the problem statement.
