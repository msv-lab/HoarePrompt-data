The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple containing multiple inner tuples of numerical values. It calculates the average of each corresponding position across all inner tuples, provided that there is at least one inner tuple present. The result is stored in a list called `averages`, which contains these computed averages.

However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples of varying lengths. If `tuples` is empty or if the inner tuples do not all have the same length, this may lead to an IndexError. 

Additionally, in such cases where the loop cannot execute due to insufficient data, the function would still return an empty list. Therefore, the actual functionality includes these potential edge cases and acknowledges that the averaging operation assumes the inner tuples have the same length. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of tuples, calculates the average of each corresponding position across all inner tuples, and returns a list of averages. If `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples of varying lengths, this could lead to an error, but the function will return an empty list if no calculations can be made. **
