According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_elements`. For the loop to execute, `num_elements` must be greater than 0. Since `num_elements` is defined as equal to the length of the first inner tuple in `tuples`, the first inner tuple must exist and contain elements.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `tuples` must be a non-empty tuple containing at least one inner tuple with at least one element. The variable `i` should start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with at least 1 element, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
