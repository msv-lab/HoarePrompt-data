Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully comply with the problem description due to a potential issue with how it handles the input. Specifically, the problem description requires that the function computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple, assuming that all inner tuples have the same length. However, the existing code does not account for the possibility of the input being empty or having inner tuples of varying lengths. 

If `tuples` is empty or if the inner tuples do not all contain the same amount of elements, this will lead to an `IndexError` when trying to access `tuples[0]` or when indexing `t[i]` within the for loop:

1. **Empty Input Case**: If `tuples` is an empty tuple (e.g., `func_1(())`), the code will raise an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the first inner tuple with `tuples[0]`.
   
2. **Varying Lengths Case**: If the inner tuples have different lengths, an `IndexError` will occur when accessing an index `i` that may not exist in one of the inner tuples: `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`.

According to the problem description, the function must handle these situations correctly, whether that means returning an empty list or managing the discrepancies between inner tuple lengths. Therefore, due to these issues, the program is not correct.
