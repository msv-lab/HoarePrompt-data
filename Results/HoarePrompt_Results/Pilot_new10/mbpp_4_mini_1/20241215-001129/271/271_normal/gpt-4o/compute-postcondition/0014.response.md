Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with a length equal to `num_elements`; `num_elements` is the number of elements in the first inner tuple of `tuples`; `averages` contains the average of each corresponding position across all inner tuples in `tuples`. If the loop does not execute, `averages` remains an empty list.**
