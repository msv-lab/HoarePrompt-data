In this case, the `averages` list will have the value of `avg` appended to it. Although the specific values of the `averages` list and `avg` are not provided, it's noted that `avg` is derived from the calculation of the average of the second elements from `elements_at_position`. No other variables have changed, and any existing values in `averages` will be preserved, with `avg` being added as a new element.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with at least 3 elements; `num_elements` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `elements_at_position` contains the second elements from the tuples; `avg` is the average of the second elements from `elements_at_position`; `averages` is updated to include `avg`.**
