Output State: **The program returns 'averages' which contains the average of each corresponding position across all inner tuples in 'tuples', and 'tuples' must have at least one inner tuple with a length equal to 'num_elements', which is the number of elements in the first inner tuple. If the loop does not execute, 'averages' remains an empty list.**
