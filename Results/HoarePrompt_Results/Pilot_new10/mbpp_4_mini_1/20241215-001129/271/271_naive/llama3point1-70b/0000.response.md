To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

**Problem Description:** 
Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Functionality:**
   - The program uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the tuple of tuples, allowing us to compute averages across the corresponding positions.
   - For each transposed position (`val`), it calculates the sum of the values and divides by the number of tuples to get the average.

2. **Potential Issues:**
   - If `tuples` is an empty tuple, `len(tuples)` will be `0`, leading to a division by zero when calculating the average.
   - If the tuples have different lengths, this will not be handled properly. The `zip` function stops at the shortest tuple, so any unaccounted elements in longer tuples will be ignored.

### Testing with Edge Cases:

1. **Empty Input:**
   - Input: `()`
     - Here, `zip(*tuples)` will return an empty iterator, and the program will attempt to divide by zero because `len(tuples)` will be `0`. This will result in a runtime error.

2. **Different Length Tuples:**
   - Input: `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))`
     - Here, `zip(*tuples)` will only consider `(1, 4)` and `(2, 5)`, and the third position will be omitted. Therefore, it will only calculate averages for the first two positions (1 and 4; 2 and 5), and there won't be a correct average for the last position, which violates the problem's requirement to compute averages for each position. 

Based on the observations, the program does not handle the division by zero error and does not account for varying lengths of the input tuples. 

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
