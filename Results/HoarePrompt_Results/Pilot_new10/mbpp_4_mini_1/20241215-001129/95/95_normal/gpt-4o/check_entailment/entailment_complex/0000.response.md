Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly implementing a function `func_1` that counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' within a given string `s`. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` takes a string as an argument.
2. **Using the `count` Method**: It utilizes the `count` method available for strings in Python, which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring ('std') within the string `s`.
3. **Testing with Assertions**: The assertions provided before the function definition check various cases, ensuring that the function accurately counts occurrences:
   - 'letstdlenstdporstd' contains 'std' 3 times.
   - 'truststdsolensporsd' contains 'std' 1 time.
   - 'makestdsostdworthit' contains 'std' 2 times.
   - 'stds' contains 'std' 1 time.
   - An empty string '' contains 'std' 0 times.

Since the `count` method in Python does not consider overlaps, any instance of 'std' is counted as intended by the problem description, which does not specify counting overlaps. Therefore, in all provided assertions, the results align perfectly with the expected counts, demonstrating that the function behaves correctly for the problem at hand.
