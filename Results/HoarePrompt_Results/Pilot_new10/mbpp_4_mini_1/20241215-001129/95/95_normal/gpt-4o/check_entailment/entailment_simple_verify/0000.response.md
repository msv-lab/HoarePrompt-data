Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1(s: str) -> int` correctly utilizes the built-in method `s.count('std')` to count the non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s`. 

The assertions provided cover a variety of test cases, and the annotations confirm that the program's behavior aligns with the problem description, specifically verifying that the function behaves as expected under different inputs, including valid cases and edge cases like the empty string. The logic of counting occurrences is clearly outlined in the annotations, affirming the correctness of the implementation.

Given these considerations, the program effectively meets the outlined requirements, concluding that the original assessment's correctness statement holds true.
