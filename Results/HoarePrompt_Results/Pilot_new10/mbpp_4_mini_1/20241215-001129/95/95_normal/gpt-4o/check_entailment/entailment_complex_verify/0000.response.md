Final: **False** 

The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std'. However, the annotated version incorrectly claims that the function counts overlapping occurrences, but Python's `str.count()` method does not count overlapping occurrences. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate as it did not recognize this crucial detail, which could lead to incorrect results in cases where 'std' appears back-to-back, such as in the string 'stdstd'. Since the function does not handle overlapping occurrences and the assessment failed to note this, the final correctness of the program based on the problem description is indeed incorrect.
