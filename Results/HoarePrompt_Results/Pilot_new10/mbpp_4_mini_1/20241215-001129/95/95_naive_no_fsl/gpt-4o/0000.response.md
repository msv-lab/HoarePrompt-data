Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The use of the `count` method on the string ensures that all non-overlapping occurrences of 'std' are counted accurately.

I have tested the function against the provided assertions, and it produces the expected results for all cases:
- For input 'letstdlenstdporstd', it returns 3, which is correct.
- For input 'truststdsolensporsd', it returns 1, which is correct.
- For input 'makestdsostdworthit', it returns 2, which is correct.
- For input 'stds', it returns 1, which is correct.
- For input '', it returns 0, which is correct.

There doesn't appear to be any potential edge cases that the function does not handle. It effectively counts all occurrences of 'std', even in cases where the string is empty or when 'std' is at the beginning or the end of the string. 

Thus, based on all these considerations, the program is correct.
