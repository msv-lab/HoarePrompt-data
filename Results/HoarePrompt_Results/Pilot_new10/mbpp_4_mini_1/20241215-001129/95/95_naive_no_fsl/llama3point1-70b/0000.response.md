Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as an argument and counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' within that string using the built-in string method `count()`. 

The behavior of the `count()` method is such that it correctly accounts for overlapping and non-overlapping occurrences of the substring. For example:
- For the input `s = "std std std"`, it will return `3`.
- For the input `s = "estd stds"`, it will return `1` since it correctly identifies 'std'.
- For the input `s = "nothing here"`, it will return `0` indicating no occurrences.

The program correctly handles various cases such as:
- An empty string (returns `0`).
- A string that does not contain 'std' (returns `0`).
- A string that contains 'std' multiple times.

Since I cannot think of any case where the program does not meet the specified requirements in the problem description, the conclusion is that the program works correctly for all input cases.
