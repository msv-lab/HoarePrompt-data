Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the second unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums` if there is more than one unique integer. If there is only one unique integer or if `nums` is not provided correctly (e.g., fewer than two elements, although this is stated not to be the case), the function returns `None`. **
