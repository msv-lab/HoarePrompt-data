Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality to find the second smallest unique number in a list, following the problem description. The function `func_1` first converts the input list `nums` into a set to filter out duplicates and then sorts the unique numbers. If there are more than one unique numbers, it returns the second smallest; otherwise, it returns `None`. The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves correctly for different test cases, including cases with negative numbers and duplicates. Thus, based on the provided problem description and the output hints, the implementation correctly meets the specifications.
