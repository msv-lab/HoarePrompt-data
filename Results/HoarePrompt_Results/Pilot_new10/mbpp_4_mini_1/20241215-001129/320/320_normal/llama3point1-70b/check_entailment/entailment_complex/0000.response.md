The function `func_1(nums)` is designed to find the second smallest number in a list of integers. Let's analyze its correctness based on the provided problem description.

According to the problem description, the function should:
1. Accept a list of integers.
2. Return the second smallest number in that list.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Handling Unique Integers:**
   - The function converts `nums` into a list of unique integers using `set(nums)`. This is correct because we need to consider unique values when determining the second smallest number.

2. **Checking Length of Unique Integers:**
   - The function checks the length of `unique_nums`. If there are fewer than 2 unique integers, it returns `None`. However, this aspect is already conditioned by the problem description which states that the input list should have at least two elements, but it does not specify that there must be at least two unique integers. Therefore, if both integers are the same (e.g., `[1, 1]`), the function correctly identifies that there aren't enough unique integers and returns `None`, which could be seen as an incorrect behavior based on the strict interpretation of finding the second smallest.

3. **Returning the Second Smallest:**
   - If there are at least 2 unique integers, the function sorts these numbers and returns the second one, which is indeed the requirement to find the second smallest integer.

### Conclusion:
The function handles the case correctly for inputs that contain at least two unique integers. However, the problem description allows for a list of integers with at least two elements, which does not guarantee that there will be two distinct integers. The special case where all integers are the same (e.g., `[2, 2]`) results in `None`, which means the function violates the expectation of always returning a second smallest value as intended by the problem description.

Given this analysis, the function does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description under the specified conditions.

Correctness: **False**
