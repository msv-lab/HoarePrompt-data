The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two elements. It returns None if there are fewer than two unique integers in `nums`. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from `nums`. If there are exactly two unique integers, it will return the larger one as the second smallest value. The code handles edge cases where less than two unique integers are present properly.
