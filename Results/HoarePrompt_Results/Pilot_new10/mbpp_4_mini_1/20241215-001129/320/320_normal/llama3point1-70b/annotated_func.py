#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None because the current length of 'unique_nums' is less than 2, indicating not enough unique integers in 'nums'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list of unique integers derived from 'nums', which has at least two elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two elements. It returns None if there are fewer than two unique integers in `nums`. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from `nums`. If there are exactly two unique integers, it will return the larger one as the second smallest value. The code handles edge cases where less than two unique integers are present properly.
