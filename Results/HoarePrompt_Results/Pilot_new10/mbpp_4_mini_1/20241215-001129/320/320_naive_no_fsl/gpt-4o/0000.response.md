Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` claims to return the second smallest number in a list. However, the program fails to handle the case when all elements in the list are the same, correctly returning `None` as intended. Here is a counterexample that shows the program does not work correctly:

1. The input `[1, 1, 1, 1]` should return `None` as there is no second smallest number. This case is similar to those already tested.
2. The input `[]` (an empty list) will also lead to an incorrect result. According to the description, there is no second smallest number in an empty list, and the function will return `None`, which is expected. However, the program lacks assertions for edge cases like an empty list.

A more severe issue arises from how the function handles negative numbers. For example:
- With the input `[-1, -1, -2, -2, -3]`, the expected second smallest number is `-2`, and the program correctly identifies it. 
- However, if we were to alter our expectations where the second smallest must be unique or check for proper input handling (i.e., lists that may have different types, including strings).

Thus, without sufficient assertions covering more potential edge cases (specifically empty lists or lists with mixed types), we can't fully trust the correctness of this program.

Therefore, the program is not complete, and it does not correctly verify all edge cases according to the description. Hence, the correctness is marked **False**.
