Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. It converts the list of numbers into a set to ensure all elements are unique, sorts them, and then checks if there are at least two unique numbers. If there are, it returns the second smallest; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Here are the relevant cases from the assertions:

1. `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])` returns `-2`, which is correct as `-2` is the second smallest.
2. `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2])` returns `-0.5`, which is also correct since `-2` is the smallest and `-0.5` is the second smallest.
3. `func_1([2, 2])` returns `None`, which is correct as there is no second unique number.
4. `func_1([2, 2, 2])` again returns `None`, which is correct for the same reason.

No edge cases were identified where the function does not behave as expected. It handles duplicates correctly and returns the appropriate value when there isn't a second unique number. Therefore, the program is correct.
