You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:

def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False

    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program for finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, let's analyze the code step-by-step based on the problem description.

The function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime. The logic seems correct; it returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility until the square root of `n`, which is standard practice for primality testing.

The function `func_2(n)` is tasked with finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the logic:

1. It correctly returns 7 for `n == 1`, as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is known to be 7.
2. It uses a while loop to iterate through potential prime candidates starting from 7 and checks for primality using `func_1(n)`.
3. It also checks that the prime number is of the form 6k ± 1 (hence the check `num % 6 in [1, 5]`).
4. The counter `count` increments correctly when a prime number of the desired form is found, and it returns the number when the count matches `n`.

However, there's a potential issue with the program:

- The while loop continues indefinitely until the desired nth prime is found. If `n` is very large, this could take a significant amount of time without an upper limit on `num`. Although the implementation will eventually find the nth prime as it only requires checking numbers sequentially, there’s no built-in mechanism to handle edge cases, particularly for very large values of `n`.

Moreover, for values of `n` that are very large or values for which no valid nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime exists (if such a case were to be proposed in the domain of numbers), the program would not return a result in a timely manner or would go beyond practical limits.

Thus, while the program works for small values of `n`, the lack of handling for larger values leads to potential cases where it may not perform as expected.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, where n represents the number to be checked for primality and must be greater than or equal to 0.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False because n is a non-negative integer less than 2, which is not prime.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, where `n` represents the number to be checked for primality and must be greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than 2, indicating that it is not a prime number. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks for divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns False, implying that `n` is not prime. If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not clearly handle negative inputs for its postconditions, but those cases are effectively excluded by the primary input requirement of non-negative integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, with n >= 1.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number at position 1, which is 7.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, with `n >= 1`. The value of `n` is greater than 1.
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 11; if `func_1(num)` returns true for `num` values 8, 9, and 10, then `count` will have reached `n` once `num` becomes 11.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. It returns 7 if `n` is 1. For values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which may be any prime number greater than 7 that satisfies the conditions checked in the loop. The function relies on an undefined `func_1` to determine primality and checks that prime numbers are of the form 6k ± 1. The potential for infinite looping exists if `func_1` never returns true or if the conditions to increment `count` are not met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
