You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to examine whether it accurately finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number according to the problem description.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are a specific category of prime numbers, defined as follows:

1. The prime numbers begin with 7 as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.
2. Subsequent numbers must be prime and also must yield a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6.

- The function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime.
- The function `func_2(n)` is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

**Analysis of the Code:**

1. **func_1(n)**: This function is implemented correctly in terms of checking the primality of a number.

2. **func_2(n)**:
   - It correctly initializes the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime as 7.
   - It keeps a count of how many Newman-Shanks-Williams primes have been found.
   - It then checks each successive number to see if it is both prime and satisfies `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.

Now, we need to ensure that the program works for all potential cases. 

Let's consider the input `n = 1` and `n = 2`:
- For `n = 1`, it correctly returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.
- For `n = 2`, it will find the next prime (which must also be of the form mentioned) and return 13, which is indeed the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

In testing further:
- For `n = 3`, it will output 19 (correctly, since it is the third such prime).
- Continuing this way, we get the sequence: 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, etc.

However, to validate the function’s robustness, let’s explore potentially problematic inputs:
- Input `n = 0`: The program does not handle this case, which should ideally return an indication of an invalid request since the 0th prime doesn't exist.
- Input `n < 1`: The function does not handle negative inputs and will lead to an infinite loop because the exit condition is determined solely by counting found primes.

Given the analysis, we observe that the program does not account for edge cases such as invalid values of `n` (like 0 or negative integers), and could potentially lead to an infinite loop or unintended behavior.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

This conclusion arises from the fact that the program lacks proper handling for edge cases, thus not satisfying its requirements across all potential inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than 2, indicating that it is not a prime number. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks for divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns False, implying that `n` is not prime. If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not clearly handle negative inputs for its postconditions, but those cases are effectively excluded by the primary input requirement of non-negative integers. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. It returns 7 if `n` is 1. For values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which may be any prime number greater than 7 that satisfies the conditions checked in the loop. The function relies on an undefined `func_1` to determine primality and checks that prime numbers are of the form 6k ± 1. The potential for infinite looping exists if `func_1` never returns true or if the conditions to increment `count` are not met. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
