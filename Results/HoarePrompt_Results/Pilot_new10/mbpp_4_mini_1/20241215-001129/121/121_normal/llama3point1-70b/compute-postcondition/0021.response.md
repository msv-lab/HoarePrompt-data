Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 2, and `num` is 8. If `func_1(num)` returns true and `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num`, which is 8. If `func_1(num)` returns true but `count` does not equal `n`, there is no return. Otherwise, there is no else part in the code.***
