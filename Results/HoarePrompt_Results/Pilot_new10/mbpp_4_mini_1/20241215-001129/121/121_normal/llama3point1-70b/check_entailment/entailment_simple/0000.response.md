Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Functionality**: The program contains two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to determine the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
   
2. **Primality Check**: 
   - `func_1(n)` correctly checks if a given number `n` is a prime number. It:
     - Returns `False` for numbers less than 2, which are not prime.
     - Uses a loop to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`, returning `False` if any factor is found, and `True` if `n` is deemed prime. This is the standard method for checking primality.

3. **Finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime**:
   - `func_2(n)` is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 
   - It correctly handles the special case for `n = 1`, explicitly returning 7, the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.
   - For `n > 1`, it initializes a count and proceeds with a while loop starting from the number 7, checking each subsequent number.
   - Within the loop:
     - It checks if `num` is prime using `func_1(num)`.
     - It also checks whether the number is in the form of `6k Â± 1` (i.e., `num % 6 in [1, 5]`), which is a necessary condition for it to be a prime number greater than 3.
     - If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the count and checks if this reaches `n`. If so, it returns `num`, thus providing the nth prime.

4. **Logic and Completeness**:
   - The logic used throughout the program is correctly structured to find prime numbers and identify their specific sequence (Newman-Shanks-Williams) based on established mathematical properties. 
   - The algorithm is comprehensive for retrieving the nth prime by incrementing through integers and evaluating each.

As such, the program adheres to the problem description and will function accurately for all valid inputs according to the defined criteria.
