The original assessment stated that the program has a correctness issue due to the lack of an upper limit on the value of `num` in the loop and that this might lead to unbounded execution for large values of `n`. However, the annotations clearly outline the expected behavior of the program and indicate that the function `func_2` will indeed find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime by always checking prime candidates in sequence starting from the known first prime (7). 

The program correctly handles the logic for primality testing and adheres to the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The notation in the annotations reinforces that the program accurately checks for prime status and increments the count correctly based on the primes that are found.

Moreover, it is stated in the problem that we can assume valid input, which diminishes concerns regarding abnormal input handling. Given that the program does find the correct nth prime without errors or exceptions under valid assumptions, there is no basis for declaring it incorrect due to potential performance issues when `n` becomes large, since that does not directly pertain to correctness.

Thus, considering all the provided information, the original assessment should not be accepted as entirely accurate. The code functions correctly as per the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
