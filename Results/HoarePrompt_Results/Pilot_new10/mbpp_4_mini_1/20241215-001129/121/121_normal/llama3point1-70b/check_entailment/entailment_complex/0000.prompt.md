You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, where n represents the number to be checked for primality and must be greater than or equal to 0.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False because n is a non-negative integer less than 2, which is not prime.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, where `n` represents the number to be checked for primality and must be greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than 2, indicating that it is not a prime number. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks for divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns False, implying that `n` is not prime. If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not clearly handle negative inputs for its postconditions, but those cases are effectively excluded by the primary input requirement of non-negative integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, with n >= 1.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number at position 1, which is 7.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, with `n >= 1`. The value of `n` is greater than 1.
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 11; if `func_1(num)` returns true for `num` values 8, 9, and 10, then `count` will have reached `n` once `num` becomes 11.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. It returns 7 if `n` is 1. For values of `n` greater than 1, it returns the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which may be any prime number greater than 7 that satisfies the conditions checked in the loop. The function relies on an undefined `func_1` to determine primality and checks that prime numbers are of the form 6k ± 1. The potential for infinite looping exists if `func_1` never returns true or if the conditions to increment `count` are not met.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
