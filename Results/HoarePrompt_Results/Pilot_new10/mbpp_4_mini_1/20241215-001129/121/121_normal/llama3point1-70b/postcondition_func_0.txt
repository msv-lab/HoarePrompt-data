The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than 2, indicating that it is not a prime number. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks for divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns False, implying that `n` is not prime. If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not clearly handle negative inputs for its postconditions, but those cases are effectively excluded by the primary input requirement of non-negative integers.
