The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so the previous value of `count` (which is 2) will now be 3. The values of `n` and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is now 3, `num` is 9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 3, `num` is 9**
