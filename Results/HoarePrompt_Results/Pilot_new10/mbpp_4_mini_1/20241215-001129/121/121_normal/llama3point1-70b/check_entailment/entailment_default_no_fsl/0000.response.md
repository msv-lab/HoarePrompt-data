Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. While it successfully identifies primes using `func_1`, and checks for the condition that a prime number must be of the form 6k ± 1, it may miss Newman-Shanks-Williams primes under certain circumstances, especially if the conditions to increment `count` are not met frequently enough.

For instance, if the program encounters a prime number which is neither of the form 6k + 1 nor 6k - 1, `count` will not increment, leading to a potential infinite loop. This means there are scenarios where `func_2` could potentially run indefinitely without returning the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

Additionally, the output hints suggest that there are conditions where `n` exceeds the existing primes defined by the logic, causing missed primes between the découverted ones. Therefore, the code does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description for every potential case.
