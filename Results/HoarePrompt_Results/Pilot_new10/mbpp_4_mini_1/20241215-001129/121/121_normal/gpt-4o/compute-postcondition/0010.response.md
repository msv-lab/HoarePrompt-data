According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will run as long as `i` is between 2 and `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 4. Additionally, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 to ensure the loop condition `i <= n` is satisfied.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `S_next` is 7**
