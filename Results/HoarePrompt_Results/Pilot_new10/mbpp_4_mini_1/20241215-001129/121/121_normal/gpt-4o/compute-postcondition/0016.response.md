The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n`. It returns 1 if `n` is either 0 or 1. For any other non-negative integer greater than 1, it calculates a value based on a specific sequence defined in the for loop, where the next term is derived from the two previous terms. It ultimately returns the last computed term, represented by `S1`. The implementation correctly handles edge cases for `n` being 0 or 1, and the logic for greater values of `n` is consistent with the intended sequence calculation.

The functionality of the function is to return 1 for inputs 0 or 1, while for inputs greater than 1, it computes and returns the last term of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, and for values greater than 1, it returns the last term of a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`. **
