According to the code, the loop iterates for values of `i` starting from 2 up to and including `n`. The loop's ability to execute again depends on the current value of `i` and the value of `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 so that `i` (now 3) is still less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `S_next` is 3**
