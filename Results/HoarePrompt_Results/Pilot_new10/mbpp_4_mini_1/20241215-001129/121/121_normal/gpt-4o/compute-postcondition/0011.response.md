To evaluate the code snippet's impact on the initial state, we analyze the variables affected by the assignment operation:

1. The initial values are:
   - `S0` = 3
   - `S1` = 7 

2. The code executes the assignment:
   ```
   S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
   ```

3. We calculate the new value for `S_next`:
   - Substitute the values:
   - `S_next = 2 * 7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17`

4. The values of `n`, `i`, `S0`, and `S1` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `S_next` while retaining the original conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `S_next` is 17**
