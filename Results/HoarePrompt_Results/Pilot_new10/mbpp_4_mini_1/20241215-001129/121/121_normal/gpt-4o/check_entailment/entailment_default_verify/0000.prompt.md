You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: The provided program appears to define a function that computes values based on a recurrence relation, generally associated with the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes which should return the nth prime in that sequence.

However, the initial assertions in the program seem to imply that the function is expected to return specific prime numbers. Upon examining the function `func_1`, it calculates the sequence using the recurrence relation but does not seem to implement any logic to filter out non-prime numbers or to identify specifically the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

For example:
- `func_1(3)` returns `7`, which is correct.
- `func_1(4)` returns `17`, which is also correct.
- `func_1(5)` returns `41`, which is correct too.

However, if we consider the fourth term of the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, which should ideally be `41`, we find that the implementation doesn't seem to filter these numbers or account for any non-prime outputs. The function does not check whether the computed values `S_next` are indeed prime nor does it ensure that it accounts for the sequence of primes to determine the nth prime number.

The primary issue is that the function, despite matching the given output for specific examples, does not guarantee correctness for general cases of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number or handling inputs beyond the provided examples. Thus, based on the problem description requiring it to find the nth prime specifically, and not just producing a value based on prior primes, this is insufficient.

Because the function logic does not align fully with the problem statement about finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, there could easily be a scenario where the program fails or returns numbers that are not prime or not the correct nth prime, hence:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, and for values greater than 1, it returns the last term of a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
