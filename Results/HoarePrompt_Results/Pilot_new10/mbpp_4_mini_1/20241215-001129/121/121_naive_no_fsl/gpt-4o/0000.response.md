Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but it does not implement that logic. Instead, it appears to generate a sequence that is not related to the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

For example:
- The assertion `assert func_1(3) == 7` is correct since the output is 7.
- However, for `func_1(6)`, it produces 41, but the 6th Newman–Shanks–Williams prime should be 103. The function doesn't correctly generate the appropriate prime numbers as specified in the problem statement.

Thus, there are values of `n` for which the function does not produce the correct Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, resulting in the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
