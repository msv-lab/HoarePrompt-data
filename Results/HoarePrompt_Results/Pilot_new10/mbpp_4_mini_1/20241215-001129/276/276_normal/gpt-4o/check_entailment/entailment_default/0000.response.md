Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function is intended to calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, it does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty or where the length specified by `n` does not correspond to the actual lengths of `list1` and `list2`. For instance, if either `list1` or `list2` is empty, or if the two lists have differing sizes (which is a possibility despite the assertion), the function will fail or produce an incorrect result. Furthermore, the use of the parameter `n` is redundant in the function since it assumes both lists are of the same length but does not verify this during execution either.

Additionally, the assumption that the lists must contain integers is not explicitly checked, making it vulnerable to exceptions if inputs contain invalid types. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential edge cases.
