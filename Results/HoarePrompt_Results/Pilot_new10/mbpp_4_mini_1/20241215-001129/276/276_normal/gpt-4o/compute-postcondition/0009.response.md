Functionality: ** The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and a positive integer `n`, which represents the length of either list. It merges `list1` and `list2` into a new sorted list and calculates the median of this merged list. If the merged list has an even length, the function correctly returns the average of the two middle elements; if the merged list has an odd length, it returns the middle element. The function assumes that both input lists are of the same size and does not handle cases where the lists might be empty or of different lengths. **
