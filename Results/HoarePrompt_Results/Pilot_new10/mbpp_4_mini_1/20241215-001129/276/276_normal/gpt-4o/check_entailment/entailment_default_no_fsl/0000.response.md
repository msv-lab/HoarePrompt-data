Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty or of different lengths, even though the problem description explicitly states that it should work for two sorted lists of the same size. The program assumes valid input without validation, which can lead to incorrect output or errors. For example, if both lists are empty or only one list is provided, the function would not work correctly and could potentially cause a runtime error. Given that it does not meet the problem's specifications for every potential case, it is incorrect.
