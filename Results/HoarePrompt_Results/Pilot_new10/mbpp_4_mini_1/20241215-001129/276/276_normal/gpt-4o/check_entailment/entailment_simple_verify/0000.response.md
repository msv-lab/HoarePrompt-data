Final: **True**

The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False** due to a lack of handling for empty lists. However, the annotations clarify that the function assumes valid input: lists that are sorted and of the same size, along with a positive integer equal to their length. Since the program is designed to work under these assumptions, it does not need to handle the empty case; hence, the original assessment is not accurate. The provided examples further demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for valid inputs and returns the expected median values. Therefore, the program correctly computes the median for two non-empty sorted lists of the same size.
