The `merged_list` is created by concatenating `list1` and `list2` and then sorting the resulting combined list. Since both `list1` and `list2` are already sorted, the `merged_list` will contain all elements from both lists in a sorted order.

After executing the code:
- The `merged_list` will now hold the sorted elements from `list1` and `list2`.

Other variables, `list1`, `list2`, and `n`, remain unchanged, as their definitions do not alter.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of either `list1` or `list2`; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining `list1` and `list2`.**
