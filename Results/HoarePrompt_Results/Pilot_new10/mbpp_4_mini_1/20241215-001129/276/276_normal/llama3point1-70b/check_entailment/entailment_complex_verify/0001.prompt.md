You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I will analyze the code step by step.

1. The problem requires the function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
2. The program begins by merging the two lists and sorting them: `merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)`.
3. It calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1`, which seems incorrect since the middle indices for even sizes should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`.
4. The code then checks if the size is even using `if size % 2 == 0:`. If true, the program attempts to find the median by combining the two middle numbers, but it uses incorrect indices (`middle_index` and `middle_index + 1` instead of `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`).
5. In the else clause, it retrieves the middle value, but with the faulty `middle_index`.

**Example of Incorrectness:**
Given two lists, `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` both of size 2, the expected median of the combined sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, the program calculates the median using `middle_index = 1`, resulting in accessing elements `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]`, which gives `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5` correctly in this instance, but the approaches may fail with larger datasets or with different even-numbered configurations.

Now let's test with two sorted lists of size 3: 
- `list1 = [1, 5, 9]`
- `list2 = [2, 6, 10]`

- Expected combined sorted list: `[1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10]`, and thus the median is `(5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5`.
- The code calculates `size = 3`, thus `middle_index = 3 - 1 = 2`. It will incorrectly attempt to access index `2` and `3` of `merged_list`, leading to a runtime error or incorrect output.

**Conclusion:**
The program's logic does not consistently handle finding the median correctly for all sorted lists of the same size, particularly with regards to even-size lists. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, both sorted in non-decreasing order, and size is a positive integer that is equal to the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists, and `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is equal to (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2. Otherwise, `median` is the middle element of `merged_list`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value calculated based on the merged_list derived from the sorted lists `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, the median is the middle element of `merged_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` which represents the number of elements in each list. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list and computes the median. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the merged list. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty or the assumption that `size` is equal to the length of the merged list may not hold true if the lists are not of the specified size. Additionally, there could be issues if `size` is not assigned correctly according to list lengths or if the lists contain negative integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
