The value of `median` is calculated as the average of two middle values in `merged_list`. The `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and since `size` is even, `middle_index + 1` will reference the next position in `merged_list`. Therefore, `median` becomes `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`.

The other variables retain their previous information, but we specifically know the computation for `median` based on the values at those indices in `merged_list`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `merged_list` is a sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, `median` is equal to (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2.**
