The variable `merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in non-decreasing order, the resulting `merged_list` will also be a sorted list. The size variable remains unchanged as it still represents the length of both lists.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists, `merged_list` is a sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`.**
