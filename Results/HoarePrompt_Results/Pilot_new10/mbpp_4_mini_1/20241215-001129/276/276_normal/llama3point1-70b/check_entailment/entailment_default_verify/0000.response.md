Final: **False**.

The original assessment is accurate because the program contains logical errors in how it determines the middle index for calculating the median. Specifically:

1. The `middle_index` is computed as `size - 1`, which is indeed incorrect. For a list of size `size`, the middle index for even sizes should be `(size // 2) - 1` and `(size // 2)` for the two middle elements, while for odd sizes, it should simply be `size // 2`.

2. The handling of odd and even sizes is not implemented correctly. The median calculation does not properly account for the fact that `size` could be even, leading to miscalculating the indices when accessing merged_list.

3. The output hints confirm that the function may yield incorrect results due to these index miscalculations. The assertion about handling sorted input lists correctly implies that there are fundamental issues with merging and retrieving indices for median calculation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
