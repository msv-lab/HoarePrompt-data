Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function does not handle median calculations appropriately for lists of even sizes. The annotations confirm that if `size` is even, the median is calculated using the indices `size - 1` and `size`, which is incorrect as it should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. The assessment also correctly raises concerns about the logic potentially causing incorrect outputs in larger datasets or with lists of even sizes. Therefore, the conclusion that the function fails to consistently find the median for all cases is accurate.
