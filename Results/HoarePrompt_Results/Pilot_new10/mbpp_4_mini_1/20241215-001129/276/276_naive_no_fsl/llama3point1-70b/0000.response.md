To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I will analyze the code step by step.

1. The problem requires the function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
2. The program begins by merging the two lists and sorting them: `merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)`.
3. It calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1`, which seems incorrect since the middle indices for even sizes should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`.
4. The code then checks if the size is even using `if size % 2 == 0:`. If true, the program attempts to find the median by combining the two middle numbers, but it uses incorrect indices (`middle_index` and `middle_index + 1` instead of `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`).
5. In the else clause, it retrieves the middle value, but with the faulty `middle_index`.

**Example of Incorrectness:**
Given two lists, `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` both of size 2, the expected median of the combined sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, the program calculates the median using `middle_index = 1`, resulting in accessing elements `merged_list[1]` and `merged_list[2]`, which gives `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5` correctly in this instance, but the approaches may fail with larger datasets or with different even-numbered configurations.

Now let's test with two sorted lists of size 3: 
- `list1 = [1, 5, 9]`
- `list2 = [2, 6, 10]`

- Expected combined sorted list: `[1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10]`, and thus the median is `(5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5`.
- The code calculates `size = 3`, thus `middle_index = 3 - 1 = 2`. It will incorrectly attempt to access index `2` and `3` of `merged_list`, leading to a runtime error or incorrect output.

**Conclusion:**
The program's logic does not consistently handle finding the median correctly for all sorted lists of the same size, particularly with regards to even-size lists. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
