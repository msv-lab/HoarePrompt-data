You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program uses the `bisect.bisect_right()` function, which returns the index where the specified value should be inserted to maintain sorted order. However, the provided assertions suggest an incorrect understanding of how `bisect_right` works based on the problem description. 

For example:
- The call `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is correct since `6` should be placed at index `4`.
- The call `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is correct since `3` should be placed at index `2`.
- However, the call `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, indicating that `7` should be inserted at index `4`, which is correct; however, the condition of the function could be misunderstood for edge cases.

The main issue is that the function is not defined before the assertions, which could cause an error if one tried to run the code. If the assertions are meant to test the function after it is defined, they should be placed after the definition of `func_1`.

Additionally, there could be edge cases, such as when handling negative numbers or checking for duplicates with the same value as existing elements in the list, which are not explicitly tested in the assertions.

Thus, the implementation does not guarantee correctness for all potential cases as per the problem description, which leads to the conclusion of its failure in meticulous validation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

import bisect

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of sorted integers, and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the insertion point in 'sorted_list' where 'value' can be inserted to maintain sorted order, using the bisect_right algorithm from the bisect module.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
