The original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect because it claims that the function does not handle cases where the value being inserted is already present in the list correctly, specifically suggesting that it should return the index of the first occurrence of that value instead of the next position.

However, the output hints clarify that the functionality of the code—with `bisect.bisect_right`—is indeed to return the insertion point in the list where the value can be inserted while maintaining order, which aligns with the description of the task.

The original assessment seems to confuse the expected behavior of insertion points with how duplicates are handled. The behavior of `bisect.bisect_right` is intended to maintain the structure of a sorted output when duplicates occur, returning the position to the right of existing entries instead. The program fulfills the requirement of locating the right insertion point in sorted order, even with duplicates, as stated in the output hints.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program behaves correctly according to the problem description provided.

Final: **True**
