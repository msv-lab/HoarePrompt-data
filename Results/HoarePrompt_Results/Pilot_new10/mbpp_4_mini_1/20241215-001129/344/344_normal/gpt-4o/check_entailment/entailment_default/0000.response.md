Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly implements the function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It uses the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module, which accurately returns the index where the specified value can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The provided examples in the assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios, including cases where the value being inserted is greater than the largest element in the list, between existing elements, and even when it is greater than the last element. There are no visible edge cases or missing functionality since `bisect_right` handles duplicates properly and ensures the insertion maintains sorted order. Thus, the function meets the requirements stated in the problem description comprehensively.
