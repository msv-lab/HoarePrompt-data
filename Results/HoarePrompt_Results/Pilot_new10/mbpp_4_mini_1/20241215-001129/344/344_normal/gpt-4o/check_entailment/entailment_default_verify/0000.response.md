Final: **True**

The original assessment claimed that the program was incorrect, primarily due to the concern over how `bisect_right` works and the positioning of assertions relative to the function definition. However, upon review, the function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description, which is to find the correct insertion point for a value in a sorted list.

The use of `bisect_right` is indeed appropriate for this task, as it returns the index where the input value would be placed while maintaining the order (including handling duplicates correctly). The output hints reinforce the correctness of the implementation, stating that the function effectively handles the insertion point for sorted integers. Moreover, since we assume valid input, potential edge cases involving negative numbers or duplicates are irrelevant to the correctness assessment.

Therefore, the original assessment that claimed the program's correctness was **False** does not hold, and the program is deemed correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
