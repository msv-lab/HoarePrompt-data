The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list` and `value`. `sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value` is an integer. 

After executing the function body, the behavior is as follows:
- Case 1: If `sorted_list[0]` (the first element of the list) is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns the index `0`.
- Case 2: If the conditions for Case 1 are not met and the index `i` equals `1`, the function returns the value of `i`, which is `1`.
- Case 3: If the conditions for previous cases are not met and the index `i` equals `2`, the function returns the value of `i`, which is `2`.
- Case 4: If none of the previous cases are met and all elements of `sorted_list` are less than `value`, the function returns the length of `sorted_list`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `sorted_list` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `value`, and return the index based on the comparison of the elements in the list with the value, or the length of the list if all elements are less than the value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter sorted_list (a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order) and value (an integer). It returns the index 0 if the first element is greater than or equal to value, 1 if i equals 1, 2 if i equals 2, or the length of sorted_list if all elements are less than value.**
