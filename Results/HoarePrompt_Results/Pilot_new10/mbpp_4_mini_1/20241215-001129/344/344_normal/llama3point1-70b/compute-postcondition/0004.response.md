According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sorted_list`. The loop iterates `len(sorted_list)` times, so for the loop to execute one more time, `sorted_list` must have at least 2 integers. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`. The next iteration will increase `i` by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `sorted_list` must have at least 2 integers, and `i` will be 1 during the next iteration.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1.**
