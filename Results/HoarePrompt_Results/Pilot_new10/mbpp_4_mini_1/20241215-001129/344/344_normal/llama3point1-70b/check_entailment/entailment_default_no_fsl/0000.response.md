Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly identifies the index of the first element in a sorted list that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If all elements in the sorted list are less than the value, it accurately returns the length of the list as the insertion point.

To clarify how the function works:
1. The loop iterates through each element in the sorted list.
2. It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the provided value.
3. If such an element is found, the function returns the index of that element immediately.
4. If no element satisfies the condition (i.e., all elements are less than the value), it returns the length of the list.

This implementation handles all potential cases as outlined in the output hints, including edge cases such as:
- When the value is less than all elements in the list.
- When the value matches an element in the list.
- When the value is greater than all elements in the list.

Since the function behaves correctly in all scenarios according to the specified problem requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
