Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

Based on the provided annotations, before entering the loop, the function assumes that `sorted_list` is indeed sorted in non-decreasing order. The loop iterates through the list until it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the specified `value`. If such an element is found, it returns its index. If the loop completes without finding such an element, it correctly returns the length of the list, indicating that the `value` should be inserted at the end.

The annotated code reinforces the correctness of the implementation. It confirms that if all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value`, the function will return the correct insertion point at the end of the list. 

No edge cases or scenarios have been identified that would invalidate the correctness of this function's behavior given the assumptions about the input. Thus, the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
