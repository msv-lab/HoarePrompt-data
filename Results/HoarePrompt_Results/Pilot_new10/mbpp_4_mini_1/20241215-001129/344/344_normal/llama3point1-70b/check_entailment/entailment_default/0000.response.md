Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly implements a method to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order. The function iterates through the `sorted_list` and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `value`. If such an element does not exist (i.e., if `value` is greater than all elements in the list), the function will return the length of the `sorted_list`, which correctly reflects the insertion point where `value` should be placed. 

The output hints align with the logic implemented in the function, confirming that the behavior is as described in the problem. Thus, it handles all potential cases correctly.
