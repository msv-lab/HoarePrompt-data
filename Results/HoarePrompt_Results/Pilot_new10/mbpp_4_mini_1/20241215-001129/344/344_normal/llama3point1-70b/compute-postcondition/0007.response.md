According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `sorted_list`. In the current state, `i` is 1, and since `sorted_list` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, the length of `sorted_list` is at least 2 (hence the loop can execute a minimum of 2 times). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increase by 1.

After the current iteration where `i` is 1, `i` would be incremented to 2 in the next iteration. For the loop to be executed once again, `i` must be less than the length of `sorted_list`, which is at least 2. Therefore, the state must reflect that `i` is now set to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 2 integers, `i` is 2**.
