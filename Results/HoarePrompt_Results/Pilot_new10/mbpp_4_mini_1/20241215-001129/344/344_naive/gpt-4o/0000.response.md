Correctness: **False**.

The program uses the `bisect.bisect_right()` function, which returns the index where the specified value should be inserted to maintain sorted order. However, the provided assertions suggest an incorrect understanding of how `bisect_right` works based on the problem description. 

For example:
- The call `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is correct since `6` should be placed at index `4`.
- The call `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is correct since `3` should be placed at index `2`.
- However, the call `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, indicating that `7` should be inserted at index `4`, which is correct; however, the condition of the function could be misunderstood for edge cases.

The main issue is that the function is not defined before the assertions, which could cause an error if one tried to run the code. If the assertions are meant to test the function after it is defined, they should be placed after the definition of `func_1`.

Additionally, there could be edge cases, such as when handling negative numbers or checking for duplicates with the same value as existing elements in the list, which are not explicitly tested in the assertions.

Thus, the implementation does not guarantee correctness for all potential cases as per the problem description, which leads to the conclusion of its failure in meticulous validation.
