Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is using `bisect.bisect_right`, which returns the index to insert `value` to the right of any existing entries of that value in `sorted_list`. However, the task is to return the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, which typically means when the value is already in the list, it should be returned at the position where it could be inserted while maintaining order. 

To elaborate, consider the case where `value` is equal to an element already present in the list. For instance:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 2, 4, 5], 2) == 3
```

The expected output in this case should be 2 (the first occurrence of 2) rather than 3, which is what `bisect_right` provides.

Therefore, the program does not handle cases where duplicates are in the list correctly according to the problem description for insertion position, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
