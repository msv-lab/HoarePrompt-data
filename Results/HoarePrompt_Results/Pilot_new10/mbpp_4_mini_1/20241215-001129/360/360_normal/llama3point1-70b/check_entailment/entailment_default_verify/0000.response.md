Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but the output hints indicate that the function does not handle the case when the input list is empty. If the input to the function `func_1` is an empty list of lists (i.e., `[]`), the behavior is undefined as there are no lists to take the maximum of, which can result in a `ValueError`. This contradicts the claim that the function is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.

Therefore, while the function works for non-empty input as described, it fails to account for the important edge case of receiving an empty list, making the original assessment inaccurate.
