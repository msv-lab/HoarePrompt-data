#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers.
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the inner list from 'lists' which has the maximum sum of its integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of integers and returns the inner list that has the maximum sum of its integers. If the input list is empty, the behavior is undefined as there is no handling for that case in the code, which could lead to a potential error.
