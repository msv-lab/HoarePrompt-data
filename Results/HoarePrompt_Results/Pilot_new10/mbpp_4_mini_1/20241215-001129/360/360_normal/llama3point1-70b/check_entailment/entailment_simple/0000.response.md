Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers. 

The key functionality is achieved by using the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument. This indeed returns the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts a list of lists, as required.
2. **Finding the Maximum Sum**: The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` effectively identifies the inner list with the maximum sum of its integers.
3. **Output**: The function returns the correct list which fulfills the requirement of returning the list whose sum of elements is the highest.

Thus, the function consistently satisfies the problem description criteria for any valid input structure, and therefore is correct.
