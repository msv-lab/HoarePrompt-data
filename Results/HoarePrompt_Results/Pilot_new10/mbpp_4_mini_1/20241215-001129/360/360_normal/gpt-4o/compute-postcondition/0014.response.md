The `current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of `sublist`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged since no modifications have been made to them. However, the value of `current_sum` now reflects the total of the elements in `sublist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is maximum sum seen so far, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least `n` sublists where `n > k+1`, and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is maximum sum seen so far, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least `n` sublists where `n > k+1`, and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`.**
