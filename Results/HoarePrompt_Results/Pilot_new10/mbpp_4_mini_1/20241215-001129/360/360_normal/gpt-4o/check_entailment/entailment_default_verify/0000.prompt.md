You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is designed to return the list from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest, as per the problem description. However, there is a potential case where the logic fails. 

For example, consider the input:

```python
func_1([[5, 5, 5], [1, 1, 1], [10, 0, 0]])
```

Here, the first sublist `[5, 5, 5]` sums to 15 and the third sublist `[10, 0, 0]` sums to 10. The expected output should be `[5, 5, 5]`, but there is another situation that can be tested:

```python
func_1([[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0]])
```

In this case, both the first and second sublists sum up to the same value of 9. However, the program will return the last maximum found, which is `[3, 3, 3]` but could have simply returned any of the lists summing to the maximum value if both lists were equal, leading to ambiguity.

The program does not handle situations where there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum. It simply returns the last maximum sublist found instead of being able to recognize this inconsistency. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly cover all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of lists containing numerical values and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list because `max_list` is initialized as an empty list, and `max_sum` remains float('-inf') without finding a valid sublist to update it. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
