According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has more sublists, the loop can execute again for the next sublist. At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is the maximum sum seen so far, and `max_list` is an empty list. Since the loop is processing each sublist in `list_of_lists`, the next index to access would be the one after the last processed sublist.

Assuming `list_of_lists` has at least one sublist, after the last iteration, the loop will proceed to the next sublist. If there are `n` sublists in total, and the current iteration is on the `k`th sublist, for the loop to be executed one more time, `list_of_lists` must contain more sublists, and the next sublist will be processed corresponding to index `k+1`.

State: **`max_sum` is maximum sum seen so far, `max_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute again, `list_of_lists` must have at least `n` sublists where `n > k+1`.**
