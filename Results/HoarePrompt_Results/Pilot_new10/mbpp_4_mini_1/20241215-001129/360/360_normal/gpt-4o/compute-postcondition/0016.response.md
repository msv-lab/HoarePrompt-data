The code assigns `max_list` to `sublist`. The value of `max_list` now directly reflects the values contained in `sublist`, while `max_sum` remains unchanged as it is still equal to `current_sum`. The variables `list_of_lists` and `current_sum` also remain unaffected in terms of their values. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `max_list` is a copy of `sublist`, `list_of_lists` must have at least `n` sublists where `n > k+1`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`**
