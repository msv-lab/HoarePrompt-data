The value of `max_sum` is assigned float('-inf'), which is the smallest possible float value in Python, representing negative infinity. This change establishes a baseline for comparisons with potential sums calculated later from `list_of_lists`. The values of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing numerical values; `max_sum` is assigned the value float('-inf').**
