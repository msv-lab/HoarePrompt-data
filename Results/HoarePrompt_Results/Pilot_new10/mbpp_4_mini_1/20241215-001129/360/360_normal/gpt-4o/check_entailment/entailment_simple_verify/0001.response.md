Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum as described in the problem statement. The annotated version of the code confirms that the logic used to compute the sums and track the maximum values is correctly implemented. 

The initialization of `max_sum` to negative infinity ensures that any valid sum will be captured during the first comparison. The loop iterates through each sublist, computes the sum accurately, and updates the maximum values as necessary. The annotations confirm that after the for loop, `max_list` holds the sublist corresponding to the maximum sum found.

Furthermore, the function passes all the assertions, which indicates that it produces the expected results for the example cases provided. Since the program handles valid inputs as assumed and meets the requirements of the problem statement effectively, the overall correctness remains validated.
