You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to return the list among the input lists that has the highest sum of its elements. 

Here's why the function is correct:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity to ensure that any sum of a list will be larger during the first comparison.

2. **Loop Through Sub-lists**: It iterates over each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`. 

3. **Sum Calculation**: For each sublist, it calculates the current sum and compares it with the `max_sum`.

4. **Updating Maximum**: If the current sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and `max_list` to the current sublist.

5. **Return**: Finally, it returns the list (`max_list`) that had the highest sum.

The function passes all the provided assertions, and it handles the case where there is only one sublist. Additionally, it correctly finds the highest sum even if the input lists contain varying numbers of elements.

Since there are no identified edge cases or unexpected input scenarios where the function fails, the implementation meets the problem's requirements effectively.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of lists containing numerical values and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list because `max_list` is initialized as an empty list, and `max_sum` remains float('-inf') without finding a valid sublist to update it. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
