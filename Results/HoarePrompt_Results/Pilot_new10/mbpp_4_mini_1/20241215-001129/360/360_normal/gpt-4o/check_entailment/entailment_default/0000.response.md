Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to return the sublist with the maximum sum from a list of lists. However, the output hints indicate that if the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. This behavior is not accounted for in the examples provided in the problem description, which assume that the list of lists is non-empty. The function, as written, will indeed return an empty list if given an empty input, which means it does not fully adhere to the problem description since it does not explicitly mention handling empty input cases. Therefore, it can be considered incorrect as it does not specify what it should return in this situation. 

For instance, if `func_1([])` is called, it will return `[]`, but the problem description does not specify how such a case should be handled. This ambiguity leads to a lack of compliance with the stated requirements. Thus, the function cannot be considered correct for every potential case.
