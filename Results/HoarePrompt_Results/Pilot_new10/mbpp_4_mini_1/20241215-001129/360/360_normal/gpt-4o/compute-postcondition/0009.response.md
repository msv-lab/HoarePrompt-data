The effect of the code on the program is that `current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in `sublist`. The value of `max_sum` remains unchanged, and `max_list` is still an empty list. The variable `sublist` remains a sublist that is being iterated over from `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the Output State; 

Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum seen so far, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
