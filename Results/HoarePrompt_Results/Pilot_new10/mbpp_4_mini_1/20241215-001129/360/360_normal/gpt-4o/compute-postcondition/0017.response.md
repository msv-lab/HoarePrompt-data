Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is the maximum sum seen so far, `max_list` is a copy of `sublist` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, `max_list` remains unchanged, `list_of_lists` must have at least `n` sublists where `n > k + 1`, and `current_sum` is equal to the sum of `sublist`.***
