`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The value of `max_sum` remains unchanged at float('-inf'), `max_list` still is an empty list, and since `list_of_lists` has at least one sublist and `sublist` is the first sublist in it, the state of those variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
