Correctness: **False**.

The program is designed to return the list from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest, as per the problem description. However, there is a potential case where the logic fails. 

For example, consider the input:

```python
func_1([[5, 5, 5], [1, 1, 1], [10, 0, 0]])
```

Here, the first sublist `[5, 5, 5]` sums to 15 and the third sublist `[10, 0, 0]` sums to 10. The expected output should be `[5, 5, 5]`, but there is another situation that can be tested:

```python
func_1([[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0]])
```

In this case, both the first and second sublists sum up to the same value of 9. However, the program will return the last maximum found, which is `[3, 3, 3]` but could have simply returned any of the lists summing to the maximum value if both lists were equal, leading to ambiguity.

The program does not handle situations where there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum. It simply returns the last maximum sublist found instead of being able to recognize this inconsistency. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly cover all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
