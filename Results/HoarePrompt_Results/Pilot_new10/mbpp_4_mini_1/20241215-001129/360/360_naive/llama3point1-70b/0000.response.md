Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the list of lists with the highest sum of elements. The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` effectively finds the sublist with the largest sum by calculating the sum of each sublist and returning the one with the maximum value. 

To confirm its correctness, consider the following scenarios:

1. **Example with positive integers**: For `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`, the function should return `[3, 4]` since it has the highest sum of 7.
  
2. **Example with mixed integers**: For `[[1, -1], [2, 3, 4], [0]]`, it should return `[2, 3, 4]` with a sum of 9.

3. **Edge case with empty lists**: For `[[], [], []]`, the function should return any empty list as they are all equal (sum of 0).

4. **Single list input**: For `[[1, 2, 3]]`, it should return `[1, 2, 3]` since it's the only option.

The program handles expected cases effectively and does not have any missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to fail based on the problem description.
