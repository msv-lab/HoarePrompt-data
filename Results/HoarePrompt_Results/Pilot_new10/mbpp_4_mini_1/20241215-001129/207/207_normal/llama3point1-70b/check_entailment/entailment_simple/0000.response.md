Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is mathematically accurate for determining the area of a rectangle (Area = Length Ã— Width).

Additionally, the program specifies that `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers, which adheres to a common constraint in real-world scenarios where dimensions cannot be negative. Thus, the program will always produce the correct result whenever it is called with valid non-negative inputs.

In summary, the implementation fulfills all criteria set forth in the problem description, validating its correctness.
