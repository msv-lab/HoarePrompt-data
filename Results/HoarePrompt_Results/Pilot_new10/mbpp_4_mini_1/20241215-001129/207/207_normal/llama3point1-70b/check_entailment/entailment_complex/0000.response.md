Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two non-negative numerical inputs, `length` and `width`, which represent the dimensions of a rectangle. It correctly computes the area of the rectangle by returning the product of these two inputs.

The annotations in the code clearly explain the function's purpose and its behavior. They confirm that the function handles non-negative inputs and acknowledges that if either dimension is zero, the result is correctly zero, reflecting the area of a degenerate rectangle.

Since the program adheres to the problem description by correctly calculating the area of a rectangle and accounting for all potential cases (including scenarios with zero dimensions), it is correct.
