Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(length, width)` correctly computes the area of a rectangle by returning the product of its `length` and `width`. The function handles all specified cases outlined in the problem description. 

1. It accepts two non-negative numbers (`length` and `width`), as required.
2. The output is correct for positive values as well as for edge cases, such as:
   - When `length` or `width` is zero, the area correctly evaluates to zero, which represents a degenerate rectangle.
3. The mathematical formulation of area (length multiplied by width) is accurately implemented.

Since there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description or output hints that the function fails to handle, the code is determined to be correct in all potential cases specified.
