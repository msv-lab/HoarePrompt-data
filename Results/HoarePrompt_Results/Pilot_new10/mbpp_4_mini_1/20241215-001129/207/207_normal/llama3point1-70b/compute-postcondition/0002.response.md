Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`, and returns the area of a rectangle calculated as the product of `length` and `width`. Note that if either `length` or `width` is zero, the area will also be zero, which is a valid output representing a degenerate rectangle. **
