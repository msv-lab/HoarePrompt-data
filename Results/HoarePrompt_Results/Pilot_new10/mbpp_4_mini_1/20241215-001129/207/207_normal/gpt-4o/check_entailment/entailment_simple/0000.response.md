Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement, which is to find the area of a rectangle. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `length` and `width`, both of which are non-negative numbers, and returns their product. This product represents the area of the rectangle, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description.

The assertions provided in the program test the function with various pairs of length and width, confirming that the function consistently returns the expected results:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is the correct area.
- `func_1(10, 5)` returns `50`, which is also correct.
- `func_1(4, 2)` returns `8`, again correct.

Since the function accurately calculates the area for valid non-negative inputs, it meets the criteria outlined in the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios in the given program where the function would fail to compute the area of a rectangle correctly when provided with appropriate inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
