Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula to calculate the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width`. The assert statements confirm that the function delivers the expected results for provided test cases involving positive integers, which are the typical inputs for the area calculation of a rectangle. 

The output hints indicate that while the function does not explicitly handle negative inputs or other non-numeric cases, it is assumed that valid, non-negative numbers will be provided as inputs per the problem description. Since the function performs correctly under the assumptions stated and meets the problem requirements, the final assessment remains valid. Thus, the program is deemed correct for the specified use case.
