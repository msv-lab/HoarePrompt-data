The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers. The function calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` by `width` and returns this value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`, and return the area of the rectangle determined by these dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters length and width, both non-negative numbers, and returns the area of a rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width.**
