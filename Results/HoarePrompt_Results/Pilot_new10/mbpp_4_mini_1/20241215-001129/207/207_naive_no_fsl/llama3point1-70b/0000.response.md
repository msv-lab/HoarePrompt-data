Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle, which is given by the product of its length and width. For all valid numerical inputs (whether they are positive, negative, or zero), the function will return the correct mathematical result for the area. 

Here are some reasoning points to support this conclusion:

1. **Positive Inputs**: For positive values of length and width, the returned result will be a positive area, which is correct.
   - Example: `func_1(5, 10)` returns `50` which is the correct area.

2. **Zero Input**: If either the length or width is zero, the area will be zero, which is accurate.
   - Example: `func_1(0, 10)` returns `0`.

3. **Negative Inputs**: Area can be mathematically considered to be negative if negative dimensions are used, but in practical scenarios, a rectangle cannot have negative dimensions. The program does not enforce non-negative values, but it will still multiply the numbers correctly.
   - Example: `func_1(-5, 10)` returns `-50`, highlighting the limitation in practical sense. 

Given the program calculates the area by multiplication and does not handle validation for dimensions, it does implement the requirement as stated in the problem description without any logical errors in calculation. Thus, based on the consideration of all potential cases, the program is deemed correct.
