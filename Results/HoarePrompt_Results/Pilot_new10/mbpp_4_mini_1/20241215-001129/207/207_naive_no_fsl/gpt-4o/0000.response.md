Correctness: **True**

The program correctly defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The assert statements provided test the function with various inputs (length and width values), and in every tested case, the function returns the expected area. 

1. For `func_1(10, 20)`, the expected area is 200, and the function returns `10 * 20`.
2. For `func_1(10, 5)`, the expected area is 50, and the function returns `10 * 5`.
3. For `func_1(4, 2)`, the expected area is 8, and the function returns `4 * 2`.

The function efficiently computes the area using the formula length multiplied by width. Since it correctly handles the provided cases, including positive integer values which are common inputs for a rectangle's dimensions, I do not see any potential edge cases that have been overlooked or would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. 

Thus, the program fulfills the requirements of calculating the area of a rectangle for all tested inputs.
