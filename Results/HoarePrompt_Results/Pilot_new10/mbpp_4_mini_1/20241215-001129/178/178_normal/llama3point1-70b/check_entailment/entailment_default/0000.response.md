Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The provided function correctly follows the problem description of rounding each number in the given list, summing these rounded values, and then multiplying by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles all potential cases, including the case of an empty list, where the product will be zero due to the length being zero. Thus, it appropriately returns zero for an empty list without any exceptions. For non-empty lists, it correctly computes the rounded sum and its product with the count of numbers. Therefore, the code is valid and meets all requirements specified in the problem description.
