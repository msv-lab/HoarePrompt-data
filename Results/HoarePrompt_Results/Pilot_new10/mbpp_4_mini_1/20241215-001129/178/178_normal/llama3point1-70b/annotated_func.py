#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of real numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of total_sum, which is the sum of rounded values of 'numbers', and len(numbers), which is the number of elements in the 'numbers' list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of real numbers and returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of those numbers and the total count of numbers in the list. It does not handle empty lists separately, and the product will be zero if the list is empty, as `len(numbers)` would be zero, leading to a return value of zero in that case.
