The code creates a new list, `rounded_numbers`, where each element is the result of rounding the corresponding element from the `numbers` list. The variable `numbers` remains unchanged, consisting of the original list of real numbers. Therefore, the updated output state reflects that `rounded_numbers` contains the rounded values of each number in `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of real numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of `numbers`.**
