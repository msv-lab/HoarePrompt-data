The variable `rounded_numbers` is assigned a list created by rounding each number in the list `numbers`. The transformation applies the `round` function to each element of `numbers`. The specific values of `rounded_numbers` will be integers that correspond to the rounding of each value in `numbers`. The variable `numbers` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values (integers or floats); `rounded_numbers` is a list of integers resulting from rounding each value in `numbers`.**
