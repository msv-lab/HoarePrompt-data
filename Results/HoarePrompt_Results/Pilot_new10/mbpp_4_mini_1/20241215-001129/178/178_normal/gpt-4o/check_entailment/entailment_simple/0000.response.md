Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The function `func_1` creates a new list `rounded_numbers` that contains each number from the input list rounded to the nearest integer using the `round` function. This satisfies the first part of the problem description that states to round every number in the list.

2. **Calculating Total Sum**: The function computes the sum of the rounded numbers using the `sum` function, storing the result in `total_sum`. This aligns with the requirement to calculate the total sum of the rounded values.

3. **Multiplying by Length of List**: The final step in the function multiplies the `total_sum` by the length of the original list (`len(numbers)`). This matches the requirement in the problem statement that asks for the total sum to be multiplied by the length of the list.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns the computed result, fulfilling the requirement that the result should reflect the total sum multiplied by the length of the input list.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided in the code serve as test cases to validate that the function gives the expected output for different types of input lists.

Overall, the function meets all the requirements of the problem description across all inputs, thus confirming its correctness.
