Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should compute the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. If the input list is empty, the length of the list will be zero, and the resulting multiplication would yield zero. 

However, the program does not include any handling for empty lists, which could lead to unintended results or an error if it tries to perform operations on an empty list. If it encounters an empty list, it would return 0 because the `sum` of an empty list is 0. 

This behavior deviates from the requirements of the problem description, which does not specify how to handle empty lists but suggests that the function should produce a meaningful result rather than just defaulting to zero.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description requirements for all potential cases and is considered incorrect.
