Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. Here's how it works:

1. The triangular number for a given index `idx` is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
2. The program checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number.
3. It continues to increment the index `idx` until it finds a triangular number that has at least `n` digits.
4. As soon as it finds such a triangular number, it returns the current index `idx`.

This approach guarantees that the program will find the smallest index whose corresponding triangular number meets the digit requirement. Therefore, it works as expected for all possible inputs.
