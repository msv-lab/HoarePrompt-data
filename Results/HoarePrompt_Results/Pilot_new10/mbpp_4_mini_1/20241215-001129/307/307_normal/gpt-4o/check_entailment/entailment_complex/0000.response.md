Correctness: **True**

The Python program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with a specified number of digits (n digits). 

### Explanation:
1. **Triangular Numbers**: The function `func_1(n)` generates triangular numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` starts from 1 and increments with each iteration. Triangular numbers are calculated correctly.

2. **Counting Digits**: Inside the `while True` loop, the program checks the number of digits of the triangular number using `len(str(triangular_number))`. This correctly determines the number of digits in the triangular number.

3. **Finding the Index**: The `if` statement checks if the number of digits equals `n`. If it does, it returns `k`, which is the index of the triangular number that meets the digit requirement.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions (e.g., `assert func_1(2) == 4`) test the correctness of the function against pre-calculated values. Triangular numbers with 2 digits start at 4 (which corresponds to the triangular number 10), for 3 digits at 14, and for 4 digits at 45. 

5. **Program Logic**: The loop continues indefinitely until it finds the required triangular number with `n` digits. Since `k` starts from 1 and only increments, the loop will eventually reach a condition where `len(str(triangular_number))` equals `n`.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description and correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with the specified number of digits for all potential cases.
