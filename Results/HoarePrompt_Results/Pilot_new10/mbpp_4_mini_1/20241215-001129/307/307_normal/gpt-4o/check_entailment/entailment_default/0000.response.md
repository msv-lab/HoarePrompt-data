Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits by incrementing `k` and calculating the triangular number using the formula \( T(k) = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \). It checks the number of digits of the triangular number by converting it to a string and comparing its length with `n`. 

The provided assertions `assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, and `assert func_1(4) == 45` test specific cases. The results must yield a triangular number with 2, 3, and 4 digits, respectively, which seems to be handled correctly in the code. 

Since the code correctly identifies the first triangular number meeting the digit length requirement for positive integers `n`, and there are no indications or examples that suggest missing cases or erroneous behavior, the code appears consistent with the problem description for all potential cases outlined.

Correctness: **True**.
