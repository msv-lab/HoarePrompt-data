`k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3.**
