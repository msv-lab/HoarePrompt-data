Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely as long as there are no break conditions or exit statements. This means that there are no conditions to meet for the loop to execute one more time. Hence, we do not need to make any adjustments to the states provided.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3**
