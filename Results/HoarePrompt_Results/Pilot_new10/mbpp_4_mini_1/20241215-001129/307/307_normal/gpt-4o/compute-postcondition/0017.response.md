The loop calculates the triangular numbers incrementally and checks their digit length against the initial number of digits represented by `n`. 

- After executing once, the `triangular_number` is 1 (the first triangular number), and `k` is incremented to 2; since the length of `triangular_number` (1) is not equal to `n`, the loop continues.
- After executing twice, the `triangular_number` becomes 3 (the second triangular number), and `k` is incremented to 3; the length of `triangular_number` (1) is still not equal to `n`.
- After executing three times, the `triangular_number` becomes 6 (the third triangular number), and `k` is incremented to 4.

To summarize the output state after the loop has executed successfully until the condition checking is satisfied:

- `n` remains the same as the initial value, a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.
- `k` is equal to the first integer `k` such that the length of the corresponding triangular number matches `n`.
- The triangular number corresponding to the value of `k` will have a digit length of `n`. 

Thus, the final output state reads: 

Output State: **`k` is the first integer after all iterations where the triangular number has `n` digits, `n` stays as the original positive integer for number of digits; the triangular number is equal to the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, leading to a triangular number with exactly `n` digits.**
