Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` consistently calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( T(k) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) and checks if the number of digits in the triangular number equals `n`. 

Here's why the implementation is correct:

1. The `while True` loop continues generating triangular numbers for increasing values of `k` (starting from 1).
2. The check `len(str(triangular_number)) == n` correctly identifies when a triangular number has precisely `n` digits, ensuring the loop will only end once that condition is met.
3. The return statement `return k` provides the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits.
4. The program works for the provided assertions: 
   - For `n=2`, the output is 4 since the 4th triangular number (10) is the smallest triangular number with 2 digits.
   - For `n=3`, the output is 14 since the 14th triangular number (105) is the smallest triangular number with 3 digits.
   - For `n=4`, the output is 45 since the 45th triangular number (1035) is the smallest triangular number with 4 digits.

Since there are no indicated edge cases or potential input scenarios where the function fails to meet the problem's requirements, the code can be considered correct for all positive integers \( n \).
