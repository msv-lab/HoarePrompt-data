The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer parameter `n`, which represents the desired number of digits in a triangular number. It calculates triangular numbers in a loop, starting with `k = 1` and incrementing `k` with each iteration. A triangular number is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The function checks the number of digits in each triangular number by converting it to a string and comparing its length to `n`. When a triangular number with exactly `n` digits is found, `k` is returned.

There are potential edge cases: 
1. If `n` is very small, the function might quickly return a low value of `k`, like 1 or 2.
2. If `n` is larger, the loop will keep iterating until it finds the required value of `k` that produces a triangular number with exactly `n` digits. 

The function does not handle scenarios where `n` is non-positive or invalid since it is expected to be a positive integer, which might lead to an infinite loop in cases of improper input.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits. **
