The variable `triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 1, the calculation becomes `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which equals `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged since it represents the number of digits in the triangular number and is not directly impacted. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 1, and `triangular_number` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1**
