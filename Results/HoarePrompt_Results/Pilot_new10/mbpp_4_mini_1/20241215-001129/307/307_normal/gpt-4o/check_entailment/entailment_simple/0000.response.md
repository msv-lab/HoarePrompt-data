Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement by finding the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits.

### Explanation:
1. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The program calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), which is correct for generating triangular numbers.
2. **Digit Count Verification**: For each triangular number generated, the program checks if the number of digits (using `len(str(triangular_number))`) matches the input `n`. This ensures that we only return the triangular numbers with the specified number of digits.
3. **Return Value**: When a triangular number with exactly `n` digits is found, the function returns its index `k`, which is precisely what the problem description requires.

### Test Cases:
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (index 4, since \( T_4 = 10 \)).
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105 (index 14, since \( T_{14} = 105 \)).
- For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 136 (index 16, since \( T_{16} = 136 \)).

The program passes all assertions in the provided test cases and correctly follows the logic needed to solve the problem for any positive integer input `n`. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
