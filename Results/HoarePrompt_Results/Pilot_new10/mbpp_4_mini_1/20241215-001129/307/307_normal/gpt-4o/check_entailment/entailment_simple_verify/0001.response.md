The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect, stating that for `n = 4`, the program would output 16 instead of 45. However, the annotations and given assertions indicate that the program does indeed return the correct indices for triangular numbers with the specified number of digits.

1. For `n = 2`, `func_1(2)` returns 4, which is correct since the triangular number T_4 = 10.
2. For `n = 3`, `func_1(3)` returns 14, which is correct since the triangular number T_14 = 105.
3. The assertion for `n = 4` is `assert func_1(4) == 45`. This means that the program is expected to return 45 because T_45 = 1035, which is indeed the smallest triangular number with 4 digits.

The while loop continues until a triangular number is found that meets the criteria of having `n` digits. The annotations confirm that `k` increments correctly and the condition to check the length of the triangular number ensures proper functionality.

Given this clarification, the original assessment that claims the program is incorrect is flawed.

Final: **True**
