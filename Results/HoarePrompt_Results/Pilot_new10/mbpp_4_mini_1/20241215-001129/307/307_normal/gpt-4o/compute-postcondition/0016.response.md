The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but for the sake of understanding, we can assume its initial value was 3 since if the triangular number has the same number of digits as `n`, the function would have returned `k` as 3. However, since we are only told that `k` is incremented and not its previous value, the output will focus on what we know.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged, so the output should reflect the updated value of `k` without being able to specify its exact number from the context.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `triangular_number` is 6, `k` is incremented by 1 (new value of `k` is unknown).**
