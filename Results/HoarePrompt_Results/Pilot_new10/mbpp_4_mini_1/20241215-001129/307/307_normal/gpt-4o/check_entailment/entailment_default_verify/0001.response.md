Based on the analysis of the program and the original assessment, the original assessment states that the program is incorrect, primarily due to its failure to return the expected index for `n = 4`. 

When a positive integer `n` is provided, the function `func_1(n)` iterates through k, calculating triangular numbers until it finds the smallest k for which the k-th triangular number has exactly n digits. The original assessment claims that for `n = 4`, `func_1(4)` should return 16 because the first 4-digit triangular number is 136. However, the assertion expects it to be 45, which is indeed the output when `func_1(4)` is called.

On further inspection, the original assertion results provided for `func_1(2)`, `func_1(3)`, and `func_1(4)` are actually accurate according to the definition of triangular numbers. The discrepancies arise due to an incorrect expectations of the output values in the context of the assertion checks. Essentially, `func_1(4)` should return 16 since the 4-digit triangular number is 136, not 45.

Thus, all the conditions outlined in the problem description and clearly indicated by the output hints demonstrate that the function does indeed return correct values for the defined input. 

Considering all aspects, the original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect, but according to the correct output for the function calls it seems to be functionally correct based upon the problem definition.

Final: **False**
