The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. Based on the value of `n`, the function can return several different values across different cases. 

- In Case 1, the program returns the integer `k` which is 1.
- In Case 2, the program returns the integer `k` which is 2.
- In Case 3, the program returns the integer `k` which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, and based on the input, it returns specific integer values: 1, 2, or 3 in different cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns an integer k which can be 1, 2, or 3 based on the specified cases.**
