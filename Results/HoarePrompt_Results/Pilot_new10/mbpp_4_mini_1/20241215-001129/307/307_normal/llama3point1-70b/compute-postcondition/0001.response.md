According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to execute indefinitely. Therefore, there are no conditions that need to be satisfied for it to execute at least once. It will execute the first time without needing any adjustments to the state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits; `idx` is 1**
