To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, we must analyze the behavior of the variables involved in the loop, specifically focusing on their final values and interrelations.

Initially, we have:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits.
- `idx` starts at 1.

The loop continuously calculates the `triangular_num` based on the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, and checks if the number of digits in `triangular_num` (i.e., `len(str(triangular_num))`) is at least `n`. The loop will stop executing once this condition is satisfied.

**After executing the loop:**
1. The loop executes as long as the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) < n` holds true.
2. Once the loop exits, `idx` is incremented one final time for the `triangular_num` that satisfied the digit condition.
3. We will identify how many times the loop was executed (let's denote this as `k`).

- After k iterations:
  - `triangular_num` will be `k * (k + 1) // 2` where `k` is the value of `idx` before the last increment.
  - `idx` will be `k + 1`.
  - The `triangular_num` at the last state satisfies the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n`.

The output state consolidates the relationships:
- `idx` is now `k + 1`, indicating how many numbers (inclusive from 1) contributed to the triangular sequence.
- The output triangular number at that state has at least `n` digits.

Thus, the considerations summarize as follows:

Output State: **`idx` is the minimum integer for which the triangular number is at least n digits, `triangular_num` is k * (k + 1) // 2, n is a positive integer representing the number of digits.**
