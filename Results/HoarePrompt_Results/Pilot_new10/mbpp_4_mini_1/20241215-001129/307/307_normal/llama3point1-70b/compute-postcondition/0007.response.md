According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless a break condition is reached inside the loop body or the program is otherwise terminated. Therefore, it does not require any specific condition to be met to execute one more time. As a result, the program state remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits; `idx` is 2; `triangular_num` is 1.**
