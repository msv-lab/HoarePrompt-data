Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the triangular number corresponding to `idx` has at least `n` digits. The function continues to increment `idx` until it finds a triangular number whose string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`. There are no cases where it returns 1 or 2; it only returns the value of `idx` once the condition is met.**
