Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key points that verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which is exactly what the problem description specifies.

2. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The function calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Triangular numbers are defined as such, and this formula accurately computes them.

3. **Looping Until Condition is Met**: The function uses a `while True` loop that continues iterating until a triangular number with at least `n` digits is found. The loop increments `idx` with each iteration, ensuring that all potential indices are considered.

4. **Length Check**: When a triangular number is calculated, its string representation's length is checked to determine if it has at least `n` digits (`if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:`). This condition directly aligns with the requirement in the problem statement to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

5. **Return Value**: Once the condition is met (i.e., a triangular number with at least `n` digits is found), the function returns `idx`. This is the smallest integer that meets the criteria, consistent with the problem statement.

6. **Logic Completeness**: The function does not return any values prematurely or incorrectly, and it continues to iterate until the proper condition is fulfilled. 

Overall, the function methodically checks each triangular number in increasing order of index and correctly returns the smallest index when the requirement regarding the number of digits is satisfied, thus fulfilling the problem description completely.
