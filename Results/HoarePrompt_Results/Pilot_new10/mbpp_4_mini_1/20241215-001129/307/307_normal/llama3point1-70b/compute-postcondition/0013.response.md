The code assigns the value of `triangular_num` to be equal to `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` has increased by 1, we can denote the previous value of `idx` as `idx - 1`. Therefore, the calculation reflects `triangular_num` being the triangular number of the new `idx` value, with specific values of `idx` contributing to the calculation.

The previous state regarding the values of the affected variables is:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits.
- `idx` is now incremented by 1.

After calculating `triangular_num`, we can ascertain its value based on the new `idx`:
- The value of `triangular_num` will be `(idx) * (idx + 1) // 2`.

Thus, we can summarize the Output State.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits, `idx` is the new value after incrementing by 1, and `triangular_num` is equal to `idx * (idx + 1) // 2.**
