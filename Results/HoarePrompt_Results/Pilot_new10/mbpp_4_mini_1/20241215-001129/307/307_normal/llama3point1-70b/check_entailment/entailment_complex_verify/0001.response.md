Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the annotated code. The program successfully finds the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The logic of incrementing the index `idx` and calculating the corresponding triangular number is implemented correctly, and the function properly checks the length of the triangular number's string representation to ensure it meets the digit requirement. The annotations confirm that the function does not return early or yield incorrect values, and it behaves as expected given valid input conditions.
