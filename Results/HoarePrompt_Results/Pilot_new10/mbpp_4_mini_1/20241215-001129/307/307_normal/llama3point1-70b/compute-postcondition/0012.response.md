According to the code, the `while` loop condition is `True`, which means that the loop is designed to execute indefinitely. There are no constraints that need to be met for the loop to execute again since it will always enter the loop as long as the program continues running. Therefore, there are no necessary adjustments to the program state to ensure the next iteration can proceed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits, `idx` has increased by 1**
