The provided program defines a function that aims to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. 

1. Triangular numbers can be represented as `T_k = k * (k + 1) / 2`, where `k` is the index.
2. The while loop increments `idx` until it finds a triangular number such that the number of digits (length of its string representation) is at least `n`.

Based on the problem description and the output hints, the function seems to perform this task correctly. It continues to increment the index until the condition is met, and the lack of return values like 1 or 2 (when `n` is small) aligns with expected behavior; it focuses on finding the smallest index that results in a triangular number with the specified number of digits.

To evaluate whether it handles various edge cases correctly:

- For `n = 1`, the triangular numbers begin from `1` (which corresponds to index `1`). The first triangular number is `1`, which has `1` digit, thus it should return `1`.
- For `n = 2`, the next triangular number `3` (corresponding to index `2`) also has `1` digit, while the triangular number `6` (index `3`) has `1` digit. The triangular number `10` (index `4`) has `2` digits, so it should return `4`.
- For larger values of `n`, the logic continues to apply and the program will return appropriate indices.

There are no apparent missing cases or logic flaws, as the function seems to incrementally check every triangular number until it finds one that meets the digit requirement.

Thus, the function behaves correctly for every tested case and does not present any logical flaws or missing edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
