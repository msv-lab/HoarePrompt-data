Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The function accurately implements the triangular number formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \) and verifies the number of digits by converting the triangular number to a string and using `len()`. 

The annotated version confirms that the program's logic functions as intended. It states that the function continues to increment `idx` until it finds a triangular number whose digit count meets the requirement, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. 

No edge cases have been identified that could indicate the program may fail to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
