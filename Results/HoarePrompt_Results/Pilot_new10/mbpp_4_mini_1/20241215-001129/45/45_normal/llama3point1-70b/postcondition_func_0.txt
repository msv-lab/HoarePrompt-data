The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits of `n` undulate, meaning each digit must be either greater than or less than its neighboring digits. The function returns True if the digits undulate according to these rules and the length of `n` is at least 3; otherwise, it returns False. If `n` has fewer than 3 digits, the behavior of the function is not explicitly defined, as the loop will not execute.
