#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 3 digits, `undulating` is True if all the elements in `n` are undulating according to the defined conditions, otherwise `undulating` is False.
    return undulating
    #The program returns undulating which is True if all the elements in string representation of the positive integer 'n' are undulating according to the defined conditions, otherwise it is False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the digits of `n` undulate, meaning each digit must be either greater than or less than its neighboring digits. The function returns True if the digits undulate according to these rules and the length of `n` is at least 3; otherwise, it returns False. If `n` has fewer than 3 digits, the behavior of the function is not explicitly defined, as the loop will not execute.
