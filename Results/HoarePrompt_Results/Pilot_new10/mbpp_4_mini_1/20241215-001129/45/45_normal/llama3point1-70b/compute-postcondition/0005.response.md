Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least two digits, `i` is 1. The character at index `i` is neither greater than both its neighboring characters nor less than both its neighboring characters (i.e., either `n[i - 1] < n[i]` and `n[i] < n[i + 1]` is false, or `n[i - 1] > n[i]` and `n[i] > n[i + 1]` is false)***.
