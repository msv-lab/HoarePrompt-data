The character at position `i-1` (n[0]) is either less than the character at position `i` (n[1]) and the character at position `i` (n[1]) is less than the character at position `i+1` (n[2]), or the character at position `i-1` (n[0]) is greater than the character at position `i` (n[1]) and the character at position `i` (n[1]) is greater than the character at position `i+1` (n[2])***
