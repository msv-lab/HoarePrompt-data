Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 4 digits and `i` is 2. If `n[i - 1] < n[i]` and `n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i]` and `n[i] > n[i + 1]`, then the function continues normally. Otherwise, `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 4 digits, `i` is 2, `undulating` is False, and the most internal loop or if statement has been exited.***
