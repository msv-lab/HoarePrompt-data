You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we first need to understand the definition of an undulating number. An undulating number alternates between two digits, such as 1212121 or 121, and has to meet certain conditions:

1. The number should have at least three digits to be considered undulating.
2. The first two digits must be different.
3. The even indexed digits must match the first digit, and the odd indexed digits must match the second digit.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The function starts by converting the integer `n` into a string `s`, which allows us to easily access the digits.
2. If the length of `s` is less than 3, it returns `False`, which is correct.
3. It captures the first and second digits in `first_digit` and `second_digit`, respectively.
4. If the first digit is the same as the second digit, it returns `False`, which is correct.
5. The loop iterates over the remaining digits starting from index 2:
   - For even indices (`i % 2 == 0`), it checks if the digit matches `first_digit`.
   - For odd indices (`i % 2 == 1`), it checks if the digit matches `second_digit`.

Now let's evaluate it against some test cases:

1. **`1212121` → True**: This is undulating because it alternates between 1 and 2.
2. **`1991` → False**: This is not undulating because it does not alternate correctly.
3. **`121` → True**: This is undulating because it alternates between 1 and 2.

Let's find a potential case where the code may fail:

- **Example: `123321`**: This number should return `False` since it doesn't alternate correctly (1-2-3-3-2-1), but the code would incorrectly come to this conclusion as undulating because:
  - It would check the first (1) and the second (2) digits, which are valid.
  - It would match `1` with `1` (index 0) and `3` against `1` (index 2), failing the condition in the for loop.

This example illustrates that the program does not handle the case where the alternating digit sequences break the undulating pattern.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` and checks its string representation `s`. It returns `False` if the length of `s` is less than 3 or if the first two digits of `n` are the same. It then checks the remaining characters in `s` ensuring that characters at even indices match the first digit and characters at odd indices match the second digit. If these conditions are met, it returns `True`. If any condition fails, it returns `False`. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs explicitly, which could lead to errors in certain situations. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
