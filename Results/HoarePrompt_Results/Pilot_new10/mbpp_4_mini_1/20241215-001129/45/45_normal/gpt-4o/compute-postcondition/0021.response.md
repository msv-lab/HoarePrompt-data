According to the code, the loop can continue executing as long as the value of `i` is less than `len(s)`. Given that `i` is currently less than `len(s) - 1`, the loop will execute one more time when `i` is incremented by 1. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`, which means `i` is currently at least 2 and will increment to 3 for the next iteration. Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `i` must be 3 and still satisfy the condition of being less than `len(s)`.

In summary:
- The next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The loop will continue if `i` remains less than `len(s)`.

State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 100, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`, `first_digit` is different from `second_digit`, `i` is 3**
