The variable `second_digit` is assigned the value of the character at index 1 of the string `s`. Since `s` is the string representation of `n`, `s[1]` will give the second character of that string. Therefore, `second_digit` will hold the value of the second digit of `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`.**
