Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is at least 100, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`, `first_digit` is different from `second_digit`, and for some index `i`, either `i` is odd or `s[i]` is equal to `first_digit`. Additionally, the current value of `i` is odd and `s[i]` is different from `second_digit`.***
