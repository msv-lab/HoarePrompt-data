To determine the correctness of the given function `func_1` that checks if a number is undulating, let's first clarify what it means for a number to be undulating. Generally, an undulating number is one where digits alternate between increasing and decreasing.

The logic in the code provided is as follows:

1. The number is converted to a string for iteration.
2. A loop runs through the digits of the number, checking each digit with its neighbors.
3. The condition checks if the current digit is either strictly less than or strictly greater than both its neighbors, which would indicate an undulating pattern.

However, there are a couple of issues with this implementation:

1. The conditions provided in the loop do not account for undulating patterns that consist of alternating sequences, such as "121" or "545". For these cases, the condition fails because it requires a strictly increasing or decreasing sequence without any plateaus or repetitions. Thus, the function will return `False` even when the number is undulating.

2. Additionally, edge cases such as single-digit numbers or two-digit numbers are not handled correctly. Since a single digit can be considered undulating (there is no other digit to compare against), the function should return `True` for inputs like `7`, whereas it would not since it skips the loop due to `len(n) - 1` being `0`.

In summary, the provided function does not correctly identify undulating numbers in every case, missing both partially correct sequences and edge cases. 

Here's a test case that demonstrates the failure:
- Input: `121` â†’ Expected Output: `True` (because it alternates between 1 and 2)

According to these observations:

Correctness: **False**
