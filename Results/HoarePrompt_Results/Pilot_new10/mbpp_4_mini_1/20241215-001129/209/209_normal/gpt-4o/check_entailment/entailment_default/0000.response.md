Explanation: The code appears to correctly return the first element of each sublist. However, it does not handle the case when a sublist is empty. The function skips empty sublists entirely, which leads to the output list being potentially shorter than the number of sublists in the input. For example, if `lst = [[], [1, 2], [3, 4]]`, the expected output should be `[1, 3]`, but the function would return `[1, 3]`, which is still correct. However, if the problem suggests needing to indicate when sublists are empty, the code would not meet all specifications because it fails to maintain the same length of the resulting list as input sublist lengths. 

Since the description specifies "the first element of each sublist" and the output hints indicate a skip for empty sublists, there is a discrepancy that the function does not adequately address.

Correctness: **False**.
