Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist.

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists, in line with the problem requirement.

2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses list comprehension to iterate through each sublist in `lst`, extracting the first element (`sublist[0]`). 

3. **Output Structure**: The resulting list contains the first elements from each sublist, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to get the first element of each sublist.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided test the function with different inputs, and in each case, the function returns the expected output, confirming that it works correctly with various lists of lists.

Therefore, the function adheres to the problem description and will always fulfill the requirement of extracting the first element from each sublist, provided that each sublist contains at least one element. There is no apparent case where the function would fail to meet the problem description as it is currently implemented.
