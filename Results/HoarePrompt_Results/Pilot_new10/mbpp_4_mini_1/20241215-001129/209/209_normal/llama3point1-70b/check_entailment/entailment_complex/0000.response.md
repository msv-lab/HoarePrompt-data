Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases. The problem description states that the function should return the first element of each sublist. However, the implementation does not handle the situation where a sublist might be empty. If any of the sublists in the input list `sublists` is empty, attempting to access `sublist[0]` will result in an `IndexError`. This means the function assumes that each sublist contains at least one element, which violates the requirement that it should correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem.

Thus, while the intention of the function aligns with the goal of retrieving the first element of each sublist, its lack of error handling for empty sublists makes it incorrect as per the full scope of the problem description.
