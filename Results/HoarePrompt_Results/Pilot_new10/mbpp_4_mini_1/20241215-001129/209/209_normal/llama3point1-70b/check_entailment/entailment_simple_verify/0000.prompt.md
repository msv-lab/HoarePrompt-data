You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description, we will evaluate the code with various potential inputs.

### Problem Description:
Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

### Evaluation of the Program:

1. **Normal Case:** If the input is a list of lists with non-empty sublists:
   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`
   - Output: `[1, 4, 7]`
   - This works as expected.

2. **Empty Sublists:** If the input lists have empty sublists:
   - Input: `[[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`
   - The code will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `sublist[0]` for the empty sublist.
   - This is a potential failure case as it does not handle empty sublists.

3. **All Sublists Empty:** If the input is entirely empty:
   - Input: `[[]]`
   - The code will again raise an `IndexError` when accessing the first element.

4. **No Sublists:** If the input is an empty list:
   - Input: `[]`
   - The output would be `[]`, which is correct as there are no sublists.

### Conclusion:
The function does not account for cases where the sublists might be empty, leading to an `IndexError`. Thus, it does not meet the requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of lists.
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in the list 'sublists'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
