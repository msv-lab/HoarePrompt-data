Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment accurately identifies that the program does not handle cases where sublists may be empty, which leads to an `IndexError`. Based on the problem description, the function should retrieve the first element of each sublist, and it is a valid concern that an empty sublist would cause an error. Although the assessment assumes valid input, the issue of empty sublists is a clear violation of the requirements, therefore, the conclusion that the program is incorrect stands.
