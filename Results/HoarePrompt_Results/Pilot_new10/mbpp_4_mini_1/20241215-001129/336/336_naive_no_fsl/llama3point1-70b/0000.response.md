To assess the correctness of the program provided, we need to examine both the problem description and the code in detail.

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a function that checks whether every odd index of a given list contains odd numbers.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates through all indices of the list.
2. It checks if the index (`i`) is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
3. If the index is odd and the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), it returns `False`.

4. If any odd index has an even number, the function will correctly return `False`.
5. If all odd indices contain odd numbers or if the list is empty, it returns `True`, which aligns with the problem description.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Empty List:** `func_1([])` should return True since there are no odd indices with even numbers (correct behavior).
- **List with Odd Length:** For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4])`, it should return `False` because index 1 (which is odd) contains the even number 2.
- **List with All Odd at Odd Indices:** For `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1])`, it should return `True` since all odd indices (1 and 3) contain odd numbers.
- **List with Even at Odd Indices:** For `func_1([4, 2, 6, 8])`, it should return `False` because index 1 contains an even number.

From the above tests and the analysis, the program behaves as expected given different potential cases.

### Conclusion:
I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly identifies whether every odd index contains odd numbers.

Correctness: **True**
