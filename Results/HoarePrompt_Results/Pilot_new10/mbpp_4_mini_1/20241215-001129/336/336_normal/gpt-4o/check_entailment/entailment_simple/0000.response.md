To evaluate the correctness of the program against the provided problem description, we need to examine how the function `func_1` operates and whether it follows the criteria that every odd index in the list contains an odd number.

### Problem Description:
The function must check if every odd index in a given list contains odd numbers.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:
1. **Indexes**: The function loops through the odd indices of the list (1, 3, 5, ...) using `range(1, len(lst), 2)`. This is correct as it correctly targets only the odd indices.

2. **Checking Value**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the number at the current odd index is even (`if lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even number at any of these indices, it returns `False`. This also adheres to the requirement since an even number at an odd index is a violation.

3. **Return True**: If the loop completes without finding any even number at the odd indices, it returns `True`, which implies that all examined values were odd.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For an empty list or a list with only one integer, the function gracefully completes the loop without executing any iterations. As specified, if no odd indices are found (because there are none), it correctly returns `True`, satisfying the requirement.

### Conclusion:
The function accurately meets the requirements of the problem description by checking every odd index for odd numbers and returning the correct boolean value based on these checks. 

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
