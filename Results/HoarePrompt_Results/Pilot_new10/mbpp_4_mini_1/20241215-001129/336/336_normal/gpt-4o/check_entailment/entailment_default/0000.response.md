The provided program `func_1` is intended to check whether every odd index in the list contains odd numbers. Here’s the analysis based on the problem description and the output hints.

1. The function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks every odd index by incrementing by 2.
2. If any number at these odd indices is even, it returns `False`. Conversely, if all odd indexed numbers are odd, it returns `True`.
3. The function correctly handles cases when the list is empty or contains a single integer by returning `True`, as there are no odd indices to check.

However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the list may contain non-integer types. If the list has a non-integer at an odd index, the code will raise an error when trying to perform the modulus operation (`%`) on that non-integer type. 

For example:
- Input: `[1, 'string', 3]` would cause a runtime error since the second element is a string and not an integer.

This situation shows that the function does not conform to the problem’s requirements since it fails to handle potential edge cases related to data types.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program does not work correctly for lists containing non-integer types, leading to unhandled runtime exceptions.
