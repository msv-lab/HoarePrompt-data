#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, the integers at odd indices of `lst` are all odd if the loop completes without returning False; if the loop executes 0 times, `lst` must be an empty list or have only one integer.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all integers at odd indices of the list 'lst' are odd, or that 'lst' is empty or contains only one integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and checks the integers located at odd indices. It returns False if any of these integers are even; if all odd-indexed integers are odd, or if the list is empty or contains only one integer, it returns True. The function does not handle cases where the list may contain non-integer types.
