According to the code, the loop iterates over every second index in the list `lst`, starting from index `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`, and the integer at index `1` of `lst` is odd. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `2`, so `i` becomes `3`. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, the length of the list `lst` must be at least `4` (to include index `3`). 

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration should be:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `i` is 3, and the integer at index `i` of `lst` is odd.**
