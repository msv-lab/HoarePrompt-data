#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`. If the loop does not return any value, there are no indices where `i` is odd and `lst[i]` is even, meaning the method does not find an odd index with an even integer. If `lst` is empty, `i` is 0 and the function does not execute, hence no return.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the condition was satisfied regardless of the contents of the list `lst` and that the method did not find an odd index with an even integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `False` if there is at least one even integer located at an odd index in the list; otherwise, it returns `True`. If the list is empty, it will return `True` as there are no integers to evaluate.
