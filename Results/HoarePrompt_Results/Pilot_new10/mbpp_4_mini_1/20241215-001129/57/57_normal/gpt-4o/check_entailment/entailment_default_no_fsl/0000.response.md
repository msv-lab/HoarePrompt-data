Correctness: **False**

The provided implementation of `func_1` aims to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. However, there are multiple issues:

1. The `assert` statements provided to validate the function output are incorrect compared to the expected results:
   - For the first assertion, the expected output for `func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']))` should be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, but upon sorting the last sublist, it should actually be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which is correct as per the assertion.
   
   - For the second assertion, the output for `func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown']))` is not being trimmed, and thus the expected result should be `[[' green', ' red '], [' black', 'blue '], [' brown', ' orange']]` rather than what is expressed in the assertion.
   
   - The third assertion is correct as it correctly sorts the sublists containing 'zilver', 'gold', 'magnesium', 'aluminium', 'steel', and 'bronze'.

2. The output hints provided indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or if there are non-string elements. This could lead to runtime errors that should be handled gracefully.

3. Further, if there are spaces around strings or inconsistent casing in the strings, the sorting may not yield the expected order.

Due to these shortcomings in handling different data types and improper assertions in the tests, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the assertion for correctness is deemed **False**.
