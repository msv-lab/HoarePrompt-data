The original assessment indicates that the program is correct. However, the output hints suggest that the function does not check for empty sublists or handle non-string elements. This could lead to incorrect behavior if a sublist contains non-string types, as the `sorted` function would raise a TypeError when attempting to compare these elements.

Given the problem description, the expectation may be that all elements are strings, but since the output hints imply that the function does not enforce this constraint or handle cases of non-string elements gracefully, it raises a concern about the overall robustness and correctness of the program.

Therefore, upon reevaluation, the original assessment of correctness does not consider the shortcomings highlighted in the output hints.

Final: **False**
