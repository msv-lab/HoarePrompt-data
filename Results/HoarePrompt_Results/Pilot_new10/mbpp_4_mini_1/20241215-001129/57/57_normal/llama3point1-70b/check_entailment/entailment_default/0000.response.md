The provided program aims to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The implementation uses the `sorted` function with a case-insensitive key, which seems appropriate for sorting strings.

However, the output hints indicate that the function does not perform checks for empty sublists or non-string elements. This is a critical omission because:

1. If a sublist is empty (`[]`), the sorted function will still return an empty list, which is correct; however, the hint suggests that there's a lack of handling or consideration that could be seen as a functionality omission, even though it won't break the code.
  
2. More importantly, if any non-string elements are present in a sublist, the program will raise a `TypeError` when trying to sort the list since Python's sorting function will not be able to compare strings with non-string types.

Thus, while the program seems to work for valid inputs (lists of strings), it does not handle edge cases such as non-string elements and does not check for the type of items within the sublists. 

Therefore, the code does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
