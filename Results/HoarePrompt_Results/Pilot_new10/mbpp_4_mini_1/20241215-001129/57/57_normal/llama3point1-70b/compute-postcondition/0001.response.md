The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. After executing the function body, it returns a list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists of strings and return the same list of lists with each sublist sorted without considering the case of the strings.
