Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described. While it successfully sorts sublists of strings in a case-insensitive manner, it lacks checks for empty sublists and does not handle non-string elements. For example, if a sublist contains numeric values (like integers), the program will raise a `TypeError` because it cannot compare strings and integers. This means the function does not operate correctly under all circumstances as required by the problem description, which indicates a need for robustness against different types of inputs.
