Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. However, the provided assert statements indicate expected output that is incorrect. 

For example, take the input `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])`. The expected output given in the assertion is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, but the correct sorted output for the last sublist should be `['black', 'orange', 'white']`, which is not what the assertion states. 

This discrepancy indicates that the function does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for at least one input. Hence, the program is considered incorrect.
