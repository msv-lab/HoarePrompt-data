Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, using `sorted()` with a case-insensitive sort due to the `key=str.lower` argument. This approach handles various potential cases correctly, such as sublists containing mixed-case strings, empty sublists, and lists with one string. For example:

- For an input like `[["banana", "Apple"], ["orange", "apple"]]`, the output will be `[['Apple', 'banana'], ['apple', 'orange']]`, which is the expected sorted output.
- An input like `[["Hello", "world"], []]` will return `[['Hello', 'world'], []]`, confirming that empty sublists are preserved and the sorting is correctly applied.

All edge cases regarding input strings and list structures seem to be handled adequately, confirming the correctness of the implementation.
