To determine the correctness of the provided function, we need to evaluate if it indeed sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. 

The function `func_1` operates by using a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the built-in `sorted()` function to each one. The `sorted()` function sorts the strings in each sublist in ascending order based on their lexicographic order, which is the correct behavior for sorting strings.

Now, we should consider the test cases and if they cover all potential edge cases.

1. The first assertion checks the sorting of the sublists `['green', 'orange']` and `['black', 'white']`, which sorts correctly to `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. However, the sorted output seems incorrect as it suggests it would sort the list of strings as `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]` could imply an error when comparing sorted outputs.

2. The second assertion checks for leading/trailing spaces and shows the function retains those strings intact while sorting but does not remove spaces, which may lead to confusion over whether the function should also strip whitespace.

3. The third assertion sorts the sublists correctly to get lexicographically sorted results.

However, to illustrate a potential case where the program may not work as intended or as described:

- If empty sublists are provided, such as in `func_1([[], ['abc', 'def']])`, the output would be `[[], ['abc', 'def']]`, which is expected but might not be covered in the examples.

- Additionally, the issue of handling strings with leading or trailing spaces can lead to unexpected results. For instance, in the second test case, the spaces are preserved:
  ```python
  assert func_1([['  A', 'b'], [' C', 'a']]) == [['  A', 'b'], [' C', 'a']]  # This will not sort correctly based on how one would expect it to be sorted.
  ```

Given these considerations and that the provided assertions do not cover every possible edge case (like whitespace handling and empty sublists), I find that the code does not fulfill the problem description comprehensively.

Thus, I conclude:
Correctness: **False**
