Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists according to the problem description. It uses the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` to perform a case-insensitive sort, ensuring that strings are ordered correctly regardless of their case. 

Here's the reasoning for the correctness:
1. Each sublist is processed independently, which meets the requirement to sort each sublist of strings.
2. It considers all possible cases for sorting (e.g., "apple", "Apple", "banana") and will produce the expected sorted output in a case-insensitive manner.
3. Edge cases, such as empty sublists or sublists with mixed case strings, are handled correctly by the `sorted` function, as it does not raise errors or produce unexpected output.

Therefore, since there are no identified edge cases or instances where the program would fail to meet the requirements, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
