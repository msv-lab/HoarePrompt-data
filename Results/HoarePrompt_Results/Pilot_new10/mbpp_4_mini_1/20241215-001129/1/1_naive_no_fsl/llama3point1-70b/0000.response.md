Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes two lists (or tuples) as input and finds the shared elements between them using the intersection of two sets. The approach of converting the input into sets ensures that any duplicate elements in the input lists are automatically handled. The resulting shared elements are returned as a tuple.

After analyzing the implementation, the function correctly fulfills the problem requirements:
- It identifies shared elements.
- It works for lists and tuples.
- It handles edge cases like empty lists/tuples or when there are no shared elements.

For example:
1. Input: `([], [])` returns `()` - correct since there are no elements.
2. Input: `([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])` returns `()` - correct since there are no shared elements.
3. Input: `([1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5])` returns `(3,)` - correct since 3 is the shared element.

Given that no edge cases or potential failures in the logic of the code can be identified, the program is determined to be correct.
