Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists. 

1. It converts the input lists (tuples in this case) to sets, which allows for efficient calculation of common elements using the intersection operator (`&`).
2. The resulting set of common elements is then converted back to a tuple after sorting, ensuring that the output is returned in a consistent order regardless of the input order.
3. The provided assertions test various cases, including instances where the two lists have overlapping elements.

Since the function appears to handle all the input cases correctly, including different combinations of shared and non-shared elements, the program is deemed correct overall.
