Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to identify shared elements from two lists, as described in the problem statement. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function behaves as expected: it finds common elements using set intersection, sorts them, and returns them in tuple format. Additionally, the assumption that the input will be valid ensures that edge cases do not affect the correctness of the function. All test assertions provided validate the expected output, solidifying the conclusion that the program is correct.
