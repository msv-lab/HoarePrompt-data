Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the function `func_1` to find shared elements between two lists. It utilizes set operations to efficiently identify common elements and returns them in a sorted tuple. The output hints align with the program's functionality, confirming that it handles multiple data types and returns an empty tuple when there are no common elements. The assertions validate the correctness across various test cases, indicating that the function is robust and handles the problem description effectively.
