Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and computes the shared elements between them. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Use of Sets**: The function converts both lists into sets, which allows for an efficient way to find the intersection (shared elements) between the two collections.

2. **Intersection Operation**: The expression `set(list1) & set(list2)` correctly finds the elements that are present in both sets.

3. **Sorting**: The common elements are then sorted into ascending order using `sorted()`, ensuring that the output meets any requirements for order in the output.

4. **Tuple Conversion**: Finally, the sorted common elements are returned as a tuple, which fulfills the requirement of returning the results in that specific format.

The test assertions provide examples of the expected functionality, and they reflect various cases, confirming the implementation behaves as specified in the problem description. Since the program correctly identifies, sorts, and formats the shared elements from two lists in the expected output format, it fulfills the problem description accurately. 

Thus, the assessment of correctness based on the problem requirements is confirmed, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
