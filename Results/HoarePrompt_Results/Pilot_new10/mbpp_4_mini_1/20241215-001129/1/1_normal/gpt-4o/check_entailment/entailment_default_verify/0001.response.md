Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the shared elements between two lists by using set intersection, and it returns these elements in sorted order as a tuple. The provided output hints reinforce this functionality by confirming that the function handles common elements and returns an empty tuple if there are no shared elements. Additionally, since the assumptions state that user input will be valid and not cause errors, the function's behavior aligns with the problem requirements for all expected cases. Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
