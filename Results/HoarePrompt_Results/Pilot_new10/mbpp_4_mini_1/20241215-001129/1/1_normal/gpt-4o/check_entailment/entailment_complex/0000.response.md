The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description by finding the shared elements from two given lists and returning them as a sorted tuple. 

Here's the step-by-step verification:

1. **Inputs**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are intended to be lists containing elements of any data type.

2. **Finding Common Elements**:
   - The program converts both lists into sets using `set(list1)` and `set(list2)`. This approach is beneficial because sets inherently eliminate duplicate values and allow for efficient computation of common elements.
   - It uses the intersection operation `&` to find the common elements between the two sets.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The common elements are then sorted using `sorted(common_elements)` and returned as a tuple, which fulfills the requirement to return the results in ascending order, as specified in the problem description.

4. **Handling No Common Elements**: 
   - If there are no shared elements, `common_elements` will be an empty set, and `sorted()` will return an empty list, which is then converted to an empty tuple. This behavior is consistent with the expectation that if no common elements exist, an empty tuple should be returned.

5. **Annotated Cases**: 
   - The assertions provided in the annotated program check various sets of input to ensure that the function behaves correctly across different scenarios, confirming that the function outputs the expected result for given input samples.

As a result of the above analysis, the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description by accurately identifying and returning shared elements from two lists.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
