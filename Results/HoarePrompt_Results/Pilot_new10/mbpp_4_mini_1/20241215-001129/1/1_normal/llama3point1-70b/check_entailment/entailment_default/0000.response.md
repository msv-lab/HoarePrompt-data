Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program takes two lists as input and calculates the intersection of their unique elements using set operations. If either list is empty, the intersection will indeed return an empty set, which is then converted to an empty tuple. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected by stating that it returns a tuple containing the intersection of unique elements or an empty tuple if there are no common elements or either list is empty. The code correctly handles all edge cases according to the problem description, so it is deemed correct.
