Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two lists (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`), converts them into sets to eliminate any duplicate elements, and then returns a tuple containing the intersection of the two sets. 

This behavior aligns with the requirements that it should find shared elements between the two lists. 

The program also correctly handles the specified edge cases:
1. If either of the input lists is empty, the intersection will be empty, resulting in an empty tuple being returned.
2. If there are no common elements, the function will also return an empty tuple, which is the expected behavior.

Therefore, the logic in the code correctly implements the function as per the problem description and handles all potential cases accurately.
