The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of any type, and a parameter `L`, which is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len}(lst)\). After executing the function body, the program returns a tuple consisting of the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` onward. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and return a tuple where the first element is a sublist of the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second element is the sublist of elements from index `L` onward. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a non-negative integer L, and returns a tuple containing the first L elements of lst and the remaining elements from index L.**
