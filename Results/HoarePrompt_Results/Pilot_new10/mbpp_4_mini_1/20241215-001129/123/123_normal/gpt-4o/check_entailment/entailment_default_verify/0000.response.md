The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the integer `L` is greater than the length of the list `lst`. The assessment provides an example where calling `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` should return `([1, 2, 3], [])`, but the function in its current form does not properly handle this case.

However, the output hints clarify the expected behavior. They specify that `L` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer within the valid range `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. This implies that the function is designed with the assumption that `L` will not exceed the length of `lst`, and as such, the function will correctly return a tuple with the intended splits.

Since the problem description and output hints imply valid input ranges for `L`, the current implementation of the function is indeed correct for the specified conditions. Thus, the original assessment that the program is incorrect does not align with the intended restrictions provided.

Final: **True**.
