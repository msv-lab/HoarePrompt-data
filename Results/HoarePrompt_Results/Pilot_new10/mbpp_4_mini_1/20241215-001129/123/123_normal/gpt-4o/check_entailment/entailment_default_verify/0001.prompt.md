You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3) == ([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2) == (['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])
assert func_1(['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], 4) == (['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])

def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze how the function implements the requirements from the problem description. The function `func_1(lst, L)` is expected to take a list `lst` and an integer `L`, splitting the list into two parts: the first part with a length of `L` and the second part containing the remaining elements.

Let's consider the provided test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3)` should return `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`
2. `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2)` should return `(['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])`
3. `func_1(['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], 4)` should return `(['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])`

Now, I will check for additional cases:

- **When `L` is greater than the length of the list:** 
  For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the expected behavior according to the problem statement is not clearly defined but we have to consider what the function should do. The current implementation would return `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which is likely acceptable as the full list is given as the first part.

- **When `L` is negative or zero:** 
  For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)` will return `([], [1, 2, 3])`, and `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` will return `([], [1, 2, 3])`. The problem description does not specify the behavior for these cases, hence the function could be considered to either accept invalid inputs or ignore them and function correctly. However, these cases might not meet the typical expectations of handling such inputs clearly.

In summary, since the function does not clearly define or handle all potential edge cases (particularly regarding negative and zero values for `L`), we can conclude that the function is not fully correct per the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False** 

The function fails to specify handling for certain edge cases like when L is negative or zero, which leads to potential behavior that is not clearly aligned with typical expectations or the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` (where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`). It returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` onward. If `L` is equal to 0, the first part of the tuple will be empty, and if `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the second part will be empty. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
