Explanation: The program defined in `func_1` correctly takes a list and an integer `L`, and splits the list into two parts based on `L`. It handles all edge cases as described in the problem. The code utilizes list slicing effectively: `lst[:L]` retrieves the first `L` elements, while `lst[L:]` retrieves the remainder of the list. The output hints align with the logic in the code and clarify how it properly returns the expected tuple depending on the value of `L`.

1. If `L` is 0, the first part will be `[]`, and the second part will be the entire list, which is correct.
2. If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first part will contain all elements of the list, while the second part will be `[]`, which is also correct.
3. For any valid value of `L` within the given range, the function returns the correct split.

The assertions provided in the input validate the function's performance with various examples, indicating it works as intended across scenarios.

Correctness: **True**.
