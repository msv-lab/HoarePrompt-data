The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` (where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`). It returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` onward. If `L` is equal to 0, the first part of the tuple will be empty, and if `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the second part will be empty.
