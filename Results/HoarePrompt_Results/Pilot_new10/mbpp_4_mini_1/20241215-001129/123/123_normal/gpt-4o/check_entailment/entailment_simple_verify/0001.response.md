Final: **True** 

The original assessment incorrectly concluded the function's correctness was false, primarily due to not accounting for the problem's assumptions regarding valid input. The annotations clarify that `lst` is always expected to be a list, and `L` will be a non-negative integer within a valid range. The function correctly implements the behavior required by the problem description, successfully splitting the list into two parts without errors for the defined valid input conditions. Therefore, the function meets the specified requirements, including returning appropriate outputs when `L` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`, as justified by the annotations.
