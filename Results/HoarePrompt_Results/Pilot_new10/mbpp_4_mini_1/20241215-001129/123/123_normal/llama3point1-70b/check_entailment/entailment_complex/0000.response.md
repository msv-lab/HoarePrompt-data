Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` satisfies the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function takes a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` as required.

2. **List Splitting**: The program correctly splits the list into two parts:
   - It uses the slicing syntax `lst[:L]` to get the first `L` elements of the list. 
   - It uses `lst[L:]` to obtain the remaining elements starting from index `L`.

3. **Tuple Return**: The function returns these two parts as a tuple, which aligns with the requirement to return the resulting lists in a tuple.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - When `L` is 0, the function will return a tuple where the first part is an empty list and the second part contains all elements of `lst`.
   - When `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, it will return the first part containing all elements of `lst` and the second part will be an empty list. 
   - Since it is ensured in the comments that `L` will be a non-negative integer (i.e., `0 <= L <= len(lst)`), we do not need to handle negative values for `L`. 

Thus, the program meets all the conditions specified in the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is established.
