#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
    #The program returns a tuple containing the first L elements of the list 'lst' and the remaining elements starting from index L, where L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list and the remaining elements starting from index `L`. The function correctly handles cases where `L` is 0, returning all elements in the second part of the tuple, or where `L` equals the length of `lst`, returning an empty second part of the tuple. It does not handle the case where `L` is negative (but this is already constrained by the function parameters in the comments).
