Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately follows the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs. It performs the following actions:

1. It creates a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst` using slicing `lst[:L]`.
2. It creates another new list containing the remaining elements of `lst`, starting from index `L`, using slicing `lst[L:]`.
3. It returns these two lists as a tuple.

The conditions specified in the problem description, namely that `L` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, ensure that the slicing operations do not lead to any index errors. 

The function adheres to the requirement of splitting the list in such a way that the length of the first part is exactly `L`, and it handles edge cases such as when `L` is `0` (the first part will be an empty list) and when `L` equals the length of the list (the second part will be an empty list). 

In all potential cases, the function fulfills the specifications of the problem description, which means it is indeed correct. Therefore, the conclusion is that it always does what the problem description says.
