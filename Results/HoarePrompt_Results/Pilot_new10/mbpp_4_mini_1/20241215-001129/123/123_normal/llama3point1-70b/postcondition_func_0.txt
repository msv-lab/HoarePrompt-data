The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list and the remaining elements starting from index `L`. The function correctly handles cases where `L` is 0, returning all elements in the second part of the tuple, or where `L` equals the length of `lst`, returning an empty second part of the tuple. It does not handle the case where `L` is negative (but this is already constrained by the function parameters in the comments).
