Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the integer `L` is greater than the length of the list `lst`. For example:

1. If we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the expected behavior would be to return the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part, resulting in `([1, 2, 3], [])`. However, the current implementation will attempt to access an out-of-bounds index, which will lead to incorrect behavior or an error.

This shows that the function does not work as specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
