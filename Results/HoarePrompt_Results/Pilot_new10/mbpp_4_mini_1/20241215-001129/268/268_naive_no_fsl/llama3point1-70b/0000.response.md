To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze if it accurately computes the maximum value of the nth column in a matrix represented as a list of lists.

The given function is as follows:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

Now, let's examine the function step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Input**:
   - The function takes two parameters: `matrix` (a list of lists) and `n` (an integer).
   - It is assumed that `n` refers to the 1-based index of the column from which we want to find the maximum.

2. **Assumptions**:
   - The code assumes that every row in the matrix has at least `n` columns. If any row has fewer columns than `n`, trying to access `row[n - 1]` would raise an `IndexError`.
   - There's no handling for an empty matrix being passed as input.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `matrix` is empty (`[]`), the code would raise a ValueError when trying to call `max()` on an empty iterable.
   - If `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of columns in a row, it will result in an `IndexError`.
   - If `matrix` contains rows of varying length, it would also result in an `IndexError`.

4. **Testing the Edge Cases**:
   - Example 1: An empty matrix `func_1([], 1)` would raise an error.
   - Example 2: A matrix with insufficient columns, like `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 3)`, would raise an `IndexError`.
   - Example 3: If `n` is zero or negative, `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0)` would also throw an error.

Given these points, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases outlined in the problem description. The absence of error handling for edge cases such as an empty matrix and invalid column indices indicates that the implementation is lacking and would fail in those situations.

Correctness: **False**
