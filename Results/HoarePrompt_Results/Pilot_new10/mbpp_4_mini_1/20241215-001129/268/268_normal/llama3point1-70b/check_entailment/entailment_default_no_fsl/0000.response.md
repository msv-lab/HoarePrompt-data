Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or when it is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix. This can lead to an `IndexError` when attempting to access an invalid index. For example, if `n` is 0 or the matrix has fewer columns than `n`, the program will not execute correctly, as it does not include any checks for these invalid inputs. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description's requirement for every potential case.
