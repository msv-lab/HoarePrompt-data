#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists (2D list) containing numeric values, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is not empty.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the n-th column (n-1 index) of the 2D list 'matrix' containing numeric values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` containing numeric values and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the (n-1)-th column of the matrix. However, if `n` is 0 or greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix, this would lead to an IndexError, as the function does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds or when the matrix is empty. Therefore, the function expects a valid `n` for proper execution.
