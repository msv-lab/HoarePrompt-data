Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to several issues:

1. The function attempts to access the n-th column using the index `n - 1`. The problem description explicitly asks for the maximum of the n-th column (1-based indexing), but the program uses 0-based indexing, which will lead to an incorrect result when n is passed as 1 (it will access the first column instead of treating it as the first).

2. The program does not handle cases when `n` is 0 or when `n` is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix (which can lead to an `IndexError`). The problem description requires the function to properly manage such situations. 

3. The handling of an empty matrix is not adequately addressed. If the matrix is empty, accessing `matrix[0]` or trying to fetch a column would raise an `IndexError`, which again means the function does not comply fully with the problem description.

For these reasons, the function fails to consistently and correctly find the maximum of the n-th column as required.
