Functionality: ** The function accepts a 2D list `matrix` containing numeric values and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value from the (n-1)-th column of the matrix. However, if `n` is 0 or greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix, this would lead to an IndexError, as the function does not handle cases where `n` is out of bounds or when the matrix is empty. Therefore, the function expects a valid `n` for proper execution. **
