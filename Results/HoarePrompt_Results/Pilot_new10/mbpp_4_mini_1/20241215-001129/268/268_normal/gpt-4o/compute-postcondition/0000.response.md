The `nth_column` variable is assigned the list comprehension that extracts the nth element from each row of the `matrix`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and valid within the bounds of the rows of the `matrix`, `nth_column` will hold the values from the specified column of the matrix.

The initial state remains the same as no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list of lists (2D list) of numbers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]), `nth_column` is a list of the nth elements from each row of `matrix`.**
