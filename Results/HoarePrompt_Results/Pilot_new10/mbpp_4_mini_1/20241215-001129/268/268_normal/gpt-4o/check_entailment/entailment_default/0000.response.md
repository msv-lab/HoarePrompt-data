Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code does not handle the case when the input matrix is empty. If an empty matrix is passed, attempting to access the nth column will result in an `IndexError`, as there are no rows to access. This is a critical edge case, and the program fails the problem description because it does not gracefully handle this scenario. The output hints correctly identify this limitation, confirming the program's failure to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
