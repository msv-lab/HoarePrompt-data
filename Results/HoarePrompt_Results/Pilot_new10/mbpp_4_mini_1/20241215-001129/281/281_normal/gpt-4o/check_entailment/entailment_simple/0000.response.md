Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The task is to find even numbers from a provided list of integers, and the function `func_1` achieves this with the following logic:

1. The function takes a list of integers as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the provided list.
3. For each number, it checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator (`num % 2 == 0`).
4. If the number is even, it is included in the new list that the function returns.

The provided assertions test the function with various input cases, affirming that it returns the expected list of even numbers:

- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `[2, 4]`.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it correctly returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it correctly returns `[8, 12]`.

Since the function passes all given assertions and adheres to the problem description by returning a list of even integers, it is concluded that the implementation is correct.
