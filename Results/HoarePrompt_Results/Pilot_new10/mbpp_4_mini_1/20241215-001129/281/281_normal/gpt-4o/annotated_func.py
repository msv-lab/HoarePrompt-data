#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the input list. There are no checks for empty lists or non-integer values, so it relies on the input being a list of integers.
