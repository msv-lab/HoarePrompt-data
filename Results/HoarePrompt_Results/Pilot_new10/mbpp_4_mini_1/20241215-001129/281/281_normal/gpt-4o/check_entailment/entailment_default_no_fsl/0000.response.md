Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle certain potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not check for empty lists or non-integer values. For instance, if an empty list `[]` is passed, the function would return an empty list, which is correct, but if a list with non-integer types like `[1, 2, '3', 4.0]` is passed, the function would raise a TypeError due to the modulo operation not being applicable to string and float types. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
