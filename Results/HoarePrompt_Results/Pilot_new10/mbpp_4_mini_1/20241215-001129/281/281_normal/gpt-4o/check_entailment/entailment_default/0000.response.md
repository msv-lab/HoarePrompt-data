Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies even numbers from a list of integers as it uses a list comprehension that filters out numbers based on whether they are divisible by 2. However, the output hints correctly point out that there are no checks for empty lists or non-integer values. If an input list contains non-integer values (like strings or floats), or if the input is an empty list, the function does not handle these cases, which can lead to undesired behavior. For example, calling `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'])` would raise a `TypeError` when trying to perform the modulus operation on strings. Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
