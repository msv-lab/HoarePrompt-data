Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to find even numbers from a list of integers, as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers, as clarified in the program's state before the function call. 

2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by evaluating the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This correctly identifies even numbers since any integer that yields a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 is defined as even.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list containing only the even integers. If the input list is empty, the list comprehension will simply return an empty list, which meets the requirement stated in the description without any errors.

4. **Exclusion of Odd Integers**: By design, the function only includes integers that meet the even condition and excludes all odd integers, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to find even numbers.

Overall, the program behaves as required by the problem description across all described scenarios, including the edge case of an empty list. Therefore, it is correct.
