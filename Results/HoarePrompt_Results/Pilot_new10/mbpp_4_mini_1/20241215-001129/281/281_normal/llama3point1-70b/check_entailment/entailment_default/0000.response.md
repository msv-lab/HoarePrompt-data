Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly identifies and returns even numbers from the provided list of integers. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list and checks if it is even, using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. If the condition is true, that number is included in the resulting list. If the input list is empty, the comprehension will naturally return an empty list, as there are no numbers to evaluate. Thus, the function behaves as expected and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
