Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses list comprehension to filter out all the numbers that are divisible by 2 (i.e., even numbers). 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the output will be `[2, 4, 6]`, which accurately reflects the even numbers from the input list. 

There are no edge cases that are overlooked in this implementation. The function will correctly handle:
- An empty list, returning an empty list `[]`.
- A list with all odd numbers, returning an empty list `[]`.
- A list with all even numbers, returning the same list.
- Lists containing negative and zero numbers, as they will also be correctly evaluated for evenness.

Since all potential cases conform to the problem description, the program is correct.
