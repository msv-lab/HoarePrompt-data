Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a given month (represented as an integer between 1 and 12) contains 30 days. Let's explain why it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. The function `func_1(month)` takes an integer input `month`, which is expected to be in the range from 1 to 12, inclusive.
2. It creates a list called `thirty_days_months` that contains the month numbers corresponding to months with 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).
3. The expression `month in thirty_days_months` checks if the provided `month` is one of the months listed in `thirty_days_months`. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month contains 30 days. If it is not, it returns `False`.

The function effectively handles all possible integer inputs from 1 to 12, returning the correct boolean outcome based on whether the month has 30 days or not. The months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and February (which has 28 or 29 days) are properly accounted for, as they do not appear in the list and will return `False`.

Overall, the function correctly fulfills the conditions specified in the problem description for every possible case.
