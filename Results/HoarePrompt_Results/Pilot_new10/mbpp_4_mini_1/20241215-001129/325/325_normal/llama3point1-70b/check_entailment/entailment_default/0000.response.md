Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if a given month (represented as an integer from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. It uses a list `thirty_days_months` which includes the months that have 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function returns `True` if the input month is in this list, indicating it has 30 days, and `False` for all other months that have either 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) or 28/29 days (February). 

Since the output hints are aligned with the functionality of the program and there are no edge cases or missing logic as per the problem description, the code is correct and handles all potential cases.
