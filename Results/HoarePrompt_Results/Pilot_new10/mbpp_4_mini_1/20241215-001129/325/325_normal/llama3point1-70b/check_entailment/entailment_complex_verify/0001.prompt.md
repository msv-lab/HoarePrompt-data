You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The function aims to check if a specified month (given as a number from 1 to 12) has 30 days. The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

The program defines these months within a list called `thirty_days_months`, and then it checks if the input `month` is contained within this list.

Here are the potential cases to consider:

1. Input `month = 4` → Return `True` (April has 30 days) → Correct
2. Input `month = 6` → Return `True` (June has 30 days) → Correct
3. Input `month = 9` → Return `True` (September has 30 days) → Correct
4. Input `month = 11` → Return `True` (November has 30 days) → Correct
5. Input `month = 1` → Return `False` (January has 31 days) → Correct
6. Input `month = 2` → Return `False` (February has 28 or 29 days) → Correct
7. Input `month = 3` → Return `False` (March has 31 days) → Correct
8. Input `month = 5` → Return `False` (May has 31 days) → Correct
9. Input `month = 7` → Return `False` (July has 31 days) → Correct
10. Input `month = 8` → Return `False` (August has 31 days) → Correct
11. Input `month = 10` → Return `False` (October has 31 days) → Correct
12. Input `month = 12` → Return `False` (December has 31 days) → Correct

All potential valid inputs between 1 and 12 are accounted for correctly in the function.

However, the program does not handle the case where the input is not within the range of 1 to 12. If `month` is outside this range (for example, `month = 0`, or `month = 13`), the function will still evaluate to `False`, which is incorrect as those inputs are invalid and the function should ideally handle such scenarios (either returning an error message or a specific message indicating the month is not valid).

Since the program fails to accurately address all potential inputs as described in the problem (specifically regarding inputs outside the range), it does not fully fulfill the requirements set forth.

Therefore, the correctness of the program should be determined as follows:

Correctness: **False** 

The code does not work correctly for out-of-range inputs, such as `0` or `13`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the integer 'month' is in the list of thirty_days_months [4, 6, 9, 11]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` representing a month of the year (expected to be between 1 and 12) and returns `True` if it corresponds to a month with 30 days (April, June, September, or November), or `False` if it corresponds to a month with either 31 or 28/29 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December, February).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
