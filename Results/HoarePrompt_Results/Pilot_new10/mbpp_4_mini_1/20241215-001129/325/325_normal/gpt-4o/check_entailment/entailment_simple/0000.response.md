The provided program aims to determine whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. According to the problem description, this is to be checked for each month.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(month)` is defined properly to take an integer input representing the month.

2. **Months with 30 Days**: The set `months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}` correctly identifies the months that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November).

3. **Return Statement**: The function returns `True` if the input `month` is found within the set of months that have 30 days; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Assertions**: The program tests the function with three assertions:
   - `func_1(6)` which should return `True` because June has 30 days.
   - `func_1(2)` which should return `False` because February typically has 28 days (and 29 in a leap year, but it is irrelevant here as the function does not specify leap years).
   - `func_1(12)` which should return `False` because December has 31 days.

**Correctness Assessment**: 

The key issue is that the prompt explicitly asks to check if the month contains 30 days, which means the function should return `True` for months that have 30 days and `False` for those that do not. However, there are several months with 31 days (e.g., January, March, etc.) and one month (February) that has less than 30 days. 

Given that February (2) and December (12) are included in the assertions and lead to a correct return value, this does not fully evaluate the correctness of the solution for all months and the implicitly broader cases.

The function does not explicitly check for the months that have 31 days, and there are no assertions to test those. Since it only checks for months in the given set without additional condition handling for months that are not included in that set (such as returning inconsistent values for 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12), the functionality won't work as per the problem statement which requires it to return `False` for all non-30-day months.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements as outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle all cases of month checking; specifically, it does not properly return values for all months consistently with the problem requirement. It misses validations for other months that clearly have neither 30 days nor fall into the provided set.
