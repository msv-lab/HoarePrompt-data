To determine the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The function aims to check if a specified month (given as a number from 1 to 12) has 30 days. The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

The program defines these months within a list called `thirty_days_months`, and then it checks if the input `month` is contained within this list.

Here are the potential cases to consider:

1. Input `month = 4` → Return `True` (April has 30 days) → Correct
2. Input `month = 6` → Return `True` (June has 30 days) → Correct
3. Input `month = 9` → Return `True` (September has 30 days) → Correct
4. Input `month = 11` → Return `True` (November has 30 days) → Correct
5. Input `month = 1` → Return `False` (January has 31 days) → Correct
6. Input `month = 2` → Return `False` (February has 28 or 29 days) → Correct
7. Input `month = 3` → Return `False` (March has 31 days) → Correct
8. Input `month = 5` → Return `False` (May has 31 days) → Correct
9. Input `month = 7` → Return `False` (July has 31 days) → Correct
10. Input `month = 8` → Return `False` (August has 31 days) → Correct
11. Input `month = 10` → Return `False` (October has 31 days) → Correct
12. Input `month = 12` → Return `False` (December has 31 days) → Correct

All potential valid inputs between 1 and 12 are accounted for correctly in the function.

However, the program does not handle the case where the input is not within the range of 1 to 12. If `month` is outside this range (for example, `month = 0`, or `month = 13`), the function will still evaluate to `False`, which is incorrect as those inputs are invalid and the function should ideally handle such scenarios (either returning an error message or a specific message indicating the month is not valid).

Since the program fails to accurately address all potential inputs as described in the problem (specifically regarding inputs outside the range), it does not fully fulfill the requirements set forth.

Therefore, the correctness of the program should be determined as follows:

Correctness: **False** 

The code does not work correctly for out-of-range inputs, such as `0` or `13`.
