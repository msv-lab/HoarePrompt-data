Correctness: **False**.

The function does not check for the case when the input month is invalid (not in the range of 1 to 12). For instance, if `func_1(13)` is called or `func_1(0)`, the function will return `False` since these months are not accounted for, which is incorrect as they should ideally raise an error or indicate that the month is invalid. Thus, the function is not handling all potential cases as required by the problem description.
