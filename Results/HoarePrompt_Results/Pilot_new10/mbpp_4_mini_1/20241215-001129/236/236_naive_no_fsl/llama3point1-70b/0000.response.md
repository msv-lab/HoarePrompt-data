Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1(nums)` that checks if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the original list `nums` to a sorted version of itself, returned by the built-in Python function `sorted()`.

Upon review, the function will return `True` if `nums` is sorted and `False` otherwise. It handles various cases correctly:

1. An empty list `[]` is correctly identified as sorted.
2. A list with one element, e.g., `[5]`, is also considered sorted.
3. A list like `[1, 2, 2, 3]` is correctly assessed as sorted.
4. A list that is not sorted, such as `[3, 1, 2]`, will return `False`.

This function effectively captures the problem's requirements and will work for any conceivable input scenario involving lists. Therefore, no edge cases where the function would produce incorrect results come to mind.

Thus, I find the program to be correct.
