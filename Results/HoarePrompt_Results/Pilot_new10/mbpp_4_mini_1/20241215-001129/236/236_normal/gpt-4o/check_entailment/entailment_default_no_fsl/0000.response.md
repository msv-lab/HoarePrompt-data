Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` implements the logic correctly by comparing adjacent elements in the input list. If it finds any element that is greater than the subsequent one, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it goes through all pairs without finding any violations, it then returns `True`.

The output hints confirm this functionality, noting that lists with fewer than 2 elements are automatically considered sorted, which aligns with the implementation. Additionally, the examples provided in the assertions also fall in line with this behavior. The code handles various potential cases correctly, such as:

- An empty list or a list with a single element will return `True`.
- Properly identifies unsorted lists by checking pairs of elements.

Thus, there are no identified edge cases or examples that would cause the program to return an incorrect result based on the criteria specified in the problem description.
