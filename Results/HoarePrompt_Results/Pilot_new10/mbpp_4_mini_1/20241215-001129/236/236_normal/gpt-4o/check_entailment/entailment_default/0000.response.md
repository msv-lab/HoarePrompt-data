Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The implementation of `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one, returning `False` if it finds any instance where an element is greater than the subsequent element (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`). If no such pairs are found, the function returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted. 

The output hints also correctly state that if the list contains fewer than 2 elements, it automatically returns `True`, which matches the code's behavior (as no iteration occurs in that case). The code adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description, and all provided examples confirm correct outputs. Thus, the function satisfies the specified task in all cases.
