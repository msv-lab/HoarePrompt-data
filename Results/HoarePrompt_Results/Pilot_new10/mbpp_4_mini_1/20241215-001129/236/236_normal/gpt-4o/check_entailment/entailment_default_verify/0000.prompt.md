You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether the specified list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If no such case is found, it returns `True`. 

Here are explanations for the provided assertions:

1. For the input `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`, the function returns `True` because the elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. For the input `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`, the function correctly returns `False` because `20` is followed by `17`, which is a violation of the sorted order.
3. For the input `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`, the function again returns `False` because `15` is followed by `14`, again indicating a violation of the sorted order.

The function properly accounts for all scenarios, including edge cases, such as lists with only one element or empty lists, which are considered sorted by definition. Therefore, the implementation is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list contains fewer than 2 elements, it automatically returns True since there are not enough elements to determine an order. If any pair of adjacent elements in the list violates the sorted condition (i.e., if `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]` for any `i`), the function returns False. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
