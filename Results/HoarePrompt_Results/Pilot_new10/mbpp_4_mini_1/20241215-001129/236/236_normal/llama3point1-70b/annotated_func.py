#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False, based on the comparison of 'nums' with its sorted version.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of comparable elements `nums` and returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. It correctly compares the list against its sorted version, ensuring that any ordering discrepancies will yield a False result. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionalities observed in the code.
