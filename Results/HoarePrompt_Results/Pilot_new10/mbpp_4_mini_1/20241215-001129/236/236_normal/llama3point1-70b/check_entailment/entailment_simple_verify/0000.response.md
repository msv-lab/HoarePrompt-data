Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(nums)` correctly compares the input list `nums` to its sorted version, returning `True` if `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order and `False` otherwise. The annotated code confirms that the function indeed handles all cases, including empty lists and lists with one or more elements. Since valid lists are assumed as input, the function's behavior aligns with the problem description, leading to a conclusion of correctness.
