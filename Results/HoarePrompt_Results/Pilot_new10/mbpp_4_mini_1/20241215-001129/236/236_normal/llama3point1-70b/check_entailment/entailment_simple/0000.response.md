Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. Hereâ€™s how it adheres to the requirements:

1. The function `func_1(nums)` takes a single argument `nums`, which is expected to be a list of comparable elements.
2. It compares the original list `nums` with its sorted version obtained using `sorted(nums)`.
3. If `nums` is equal to its sorted version, it implies that `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The use of `sorted(nums)` ensures that the comparison correctly checks for sorting, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description. This means the function will accurately determine if the list is sorted for any list of comparable elements, as long as the elements are indeed comparable (which is a requirement for both the original list and its sorted version).

Overall, the program functions as required and handles the problem specification correctly across all potential cases.
