Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1(nums)` correctly checks if the list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with the sorted version of itself. The annotations clarify that it will return `True` if `nums` is sorted and `False` otherwise, confirming its proper functionality. Additionally, the assessment addresses different scenarios, including edge cases like empty lists and single-element lists, which are handled correctly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.
