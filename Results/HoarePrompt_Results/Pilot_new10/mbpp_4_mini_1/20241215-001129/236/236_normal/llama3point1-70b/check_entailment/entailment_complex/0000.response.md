Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` as input and checks if it is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the original list `nums` to a sorted version of itself, generated by the built-in `sorted()` function.

Here’s how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Purpose**: The function's intent is clearly defined – to check if a list is sorted. This aligns with the problem description.
   
2. **Functionality**: The expression `nums == sorted(nums)` effectively checks if the elements in `nums` are in non-decreasing order. If `nums` is the same as the sorted version, it confirms that the list is sorted; otherwise, it is not.

3. **Edge Cases**: It handles all edge cases implicitly, including:
   - An empty list, which is considered sorted.
   - A list with one element, which is also sorted.
   - Lists with duplicate elements, which the sorting function can manage.

Overall, the logic is sound, and there are no logical errors or omissions in functionality regarding the requirements specified in the problem description. Hence, the program correctly fulfills the task of checking whether a list is sorted.
