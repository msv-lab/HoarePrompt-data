Explanation: The provided code checks if a list is sorted by comparing it against its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. The output hints indicate that the function returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. Since the program correctly handles all potential cases, including empty lists and lists with identical elements, it appears to fulfill all requirements of the problem description.

The program will return `True` for an empty list `[]`, as it is technically sorted since there are no elements to contradict that. Similarly, a list with identical elements `[1, 1, 1]` will also return `True`, as it satisfies the condition of being in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the function behaves correctly for all edge cases and does what the problem description states.

Correctness: **True**.
