#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple consisting of the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuples `tup1` and `tup2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are both tuples. It returns a new tuple consisting of the bitwise AND of elements from `tup1` and `tup2`, pairing them based on their index positions. If the tuples are of different lengths, it applies the operation only on corresponding elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.
