You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to extract elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the code uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) between the elements of the two tuples. This operation does not provide a meaningful way to "extract" elements, and applying it will yield results that depend on the data type of the elements in the tuples.

For example, if we define:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
```
The result of calling `func_1(tup1, tup2)` will be:
```python
(1 & 4, 2 & 5, 3 & 6)  # which results in (0, 0, 2)
```

This output does not represent "extracting" elements from the tuples as the problem description suggests. If the tuples contain non-integer types, the program will raise a TypeError as the bitwise operator cannot be applied to them. This indicates that there are cases where the function would not behave as expected according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the solution is incorrect in realizing the intended functionality.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple consisting of the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuples `tup1` and `tup2`


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
