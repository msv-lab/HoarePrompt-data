Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not adhere to the problem description, which requires the function to "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." The problem description implies that the function should return a new tuple containing the individual elements from both input tuples, rather than performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements.

The program performs a bitwise AND operation using the `&` operator between the elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. It is specific to numerical elements and will result in a completely different output than intended by the problem description. For example, if `tup1` is `(1, 2)` and `tup2` is `(3, 4)`, the output will be `(1 & 3, 2 & 4)`, which produces `(1, 0)`. This does not satisfy the requirement of extracting the elements; instead, it transforms them.

In summary, the actual behavior of the function (performing bitwise AND) is not aligned with the stated goal of simply extracting or combining the elements of the provided tuples. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
