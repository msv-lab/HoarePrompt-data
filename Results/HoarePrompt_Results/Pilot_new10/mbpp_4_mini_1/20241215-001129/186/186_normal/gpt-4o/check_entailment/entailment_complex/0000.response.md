The given problem description requires a function that extracts the elementwise results from two tuples. However, upon examining the annotated program, we see that the function `func_1` is performing a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on the corresponding elements of the tuples. This operation may not align with the typical understanding of "extracting" elements from tuples or meeting the expected behavior based on the problem description. 

The assertions provided also expect specific outputs based on this bitwise AND operation. For example:
- The expression `(10 & 5)` returns `0`, but the problem doesn't specify that bitwise operations are intended. It purely states to "extract".

Therefore, this discrepancy indicates that the function does not correctly fulfill the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to simply extract elementwise elements from the input tuples rather than using a logical or bitwise operation.

Thus, the correctness of the program is determined as follows:

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function does not meet the problem description since it performs a bitwise AND operation instead of simply extracting elements from the two tuples. The appropriate behavior would be to return the elements as they are without applying any operation on them. For instance, if we had tuples `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, the expected output should ideally be `(a, c, b, d)` or something equally direct that respects the "extract" instruction, but the current implementation does not reflect this.
