Final: **False**

The original assessment stating that the program is incorrect is accurate. The function `func_1`, as implemented, performs a bitwise AND operation instead of correctly handling "elementwise and tuples" as per the problem description. The output hints clarify that the function should return the logical AND of corresponding elements, which aligns with the bitwise operation used. However, the original examples' outputs, such as `(0, 0, 2, 1)` from `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, do not logically correspond to the expected results of a straightforward tuple elementwise operation. Therefore, the outputs produced by `func_1` do not align with a reasonable interpretation of the problem description, reinforcing the assessment that the program does not fulfill its intended purpose.
