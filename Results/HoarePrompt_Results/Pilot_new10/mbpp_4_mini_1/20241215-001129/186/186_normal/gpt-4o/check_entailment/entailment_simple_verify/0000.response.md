The original assessment stated that the correctness of the program is **False**. The reasoning provided highlighted concerns about the ambiguity of the problem description and the function's output, indicating that it did not meet the expected requirements.

However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation correctly between corresponding elements of the two input tuples. The example outputs given in the assertions accurately reflect the expected results of that operation. The function adheres to the requirement of using the bitwise AND.

Considering the stated intent of extracting elementwise operations (which could indeed mean to perform operations like AND), the function appears to fulfill the expectation as described. The annotations confirm that the outputs are indeed consistent with the logical operation performed by the function without errors or misrepresentation of the logic.

Thus, the original assessment, which deemed the program correct as **False**, seems to have misinterpreted the logic operation required from the problem description. The program actually adheres to the specified operations accurately.

Final: **True**
