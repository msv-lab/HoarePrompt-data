To determine whether the provided program meets the problem description of extracting elementwise operations from two tuples, let's analyze the code:

The function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` takes two tuples as input and performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples using a generator expression with the `zip` function. The results are then returned as a new tuple.

### Important considerations:
1. **Input Types**: The code assumes that the inputs `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples containing elements that can be used with the bitwise AND operator (`&`). This typically means the elements should be integers or other suitable types that support the operation.
2. **Tuple Length**: If the input tuples have different lengths, the `zip()` function will pair elements only up to the length of the shorter tuple. This may not be what is expected if the problem description wants to include all elements from both tuples, potentially returning `None` for unmatched elements.
3. **Error Handling**: The code does not handle cases where input elements could be of incompatible types (e.g., strings or lists), which would raise a `TypeError`.
4. **Empty Tuples**: The function will return an empty tuple if both input tuples are empty, which is correct but does not clarify behavior in the problem statement.

Given these considerations, the potential issues arise primarily from the assumptions about types and lengths.

### Example Cases:
1. **Different Length Tuples**:
   - Inputs: `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)`, `tup2 = (4, 5)`. The expected behavior isn't specified, but the function will only compute `(1 & 4, 2 & 5)`, ignoring `3`.
   - Output: `(0, 0)`, but `3` from `tup1` is ignored.

2. **Incompatible Types**:
   - Inputs: `tup1 = (1, 2)`, `tup2 = ('a', 'b')`. Here, the code will raise a `TypeError` because strings do not support the bitwise AND operation.
   - Output: Raises an error instead of returning a tuple.

Based on the analysis, the program has potential failure cases that are not addressed by the logic in the code. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
