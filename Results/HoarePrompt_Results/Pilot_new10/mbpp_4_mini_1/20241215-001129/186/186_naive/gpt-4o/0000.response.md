Correctness: **False**. 

The provided program is intended to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, using the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from each tuple. However, the problem statement is ambiguous about whether it requires the output to be a count of how many elements are not present or some other operation related to the elements.

Given the function `func_1`, which performs a bitwise AND operation, the following cases indicate the mishap:

1. For the input `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the result is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which does not seem to conform with any standard logical extraction or count of elements based on the problem description.
   
2. The function fails to address what the output "elementwise and tuples" means. The expectation from the problem description is not fulfilled. For instance, the output does not seem to relate correctly to counts or extraction of certain values.

Thus, within potential cases, the function does not behave as expected based on the typical interpretations of tuple manipulation and the description provided. The input/output examples from the assertion do not reflect the logic implemented in the function accurately.
