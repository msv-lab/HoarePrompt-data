After reviewing the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I find that the original assessment was indeed accurate. 

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where the i-th element is equal to the product of adjacent elements from the input tuple. The annotated version of the code further clarifies that `numbers` is a tuple containing N+1 elements, thus confirming that the function's output will be a tuple of length N, as required.

The assessment notes that the function uses `zip` to pair each element with its next element, which is correct, and that the generator expression computes the product for each of these pairs. There are no edge cases that the function fails to handle, as it naturally returns an empty tuple if the input is empty or has only one element, aligning with the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, considering all aspects, the original assessment remains valid. 

Final: **True**
