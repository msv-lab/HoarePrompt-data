The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a tuple containing N+1 elements, where each element is a number. After executing the function body, the program returns a new tuple where each element corresponds to the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `numbers` containing N+1 numerical elements and return a tuple of products derived from consecutive elements of the input tuple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `numbers` containing N+1 numerical elements and returns a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple `numbers`.**
