Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's the breakdown of why the code meets the requirements:

1. **Input Format**: The function `func_1` takes as input a tuple called `numbers`, which is specified to contain `N + 1` elements (where `N` is a positive integer).

2. **Output Format**: The expected output is a tuple of length `N` where each element corresponds to the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple.

3. **Logic Implementation**:
    - The function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element in the tuple `numbers` with its next element. This effectively creates pairs: `(t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), ..., (t_N, t_{N+1})`.
    - A generator expression `a * b` then computes the product for each of these pairs.
    - The `tuple()` constructor collects these products into a new tuple.

4. **Correctness Check**: Since the input tuple has `N + 1` elements, the generator produces `N` products from pairs of elements, which matches the required output length.

In summary, the program logic adheres to the problem requirements, consistently producing the correct outputs for any valid input tuple of `N + 1` numbers. Thus, the function is correct according to the provided problem description.
