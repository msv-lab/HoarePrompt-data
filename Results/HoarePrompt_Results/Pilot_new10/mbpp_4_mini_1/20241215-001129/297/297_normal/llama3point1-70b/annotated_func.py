#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple containing N+1 elements, where each element is a number.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple 'numbers', which contains N+1 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `numbers` containing N+1 numerical elements and returns a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple. If the input tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple, because there are no consecutive pairs to multiply.
