#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with a length of at least 2 (N >= 1), where each element can be of any numeric type (integers or floats).
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements in the tuple 't', which has a length of at least 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `t` containing at least two numerical elements (integers or floats) and returns a tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements in `t`. It does not handle cases where the elements of `t` are not of a numeric type, which may lead to a `TypeError` if non-numeric types are present.
