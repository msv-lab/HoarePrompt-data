The function accepts a tuple `t` containing at least two numerical elements (integers or floats) and returns a tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements in `t`. It does not handle cases where the elements of `t` are not of a numeric type, which may lead to a `TypeError` if non-numeric types are present.
