Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a character using the `ord()` function in Python. The assertions provided in the program validate that it works for specific cases ('A', 'R', 'S'), all of which yield the correct ASCII values.

Since there are no cases where the program fails to deliver the expected output as per the problem description, and no edge cases that could cause it to malfunction, the implementation appears sound. The function covers a wide range of possible inputs (any single character), and as such, follows the problem description accurately. Consequently, I cannot think of any scenario where it would be incorrect.
