Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a character using the `ord()` function. The assertions demonstrate that it works as expected for the specified characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', returning the correct ASCII values 65, 82, and 83 respectively. 

Additionally, the `ord()` function is capable of returning the ASCII values for any valid single character input (including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters), thus satisfying the problem description comprehensively. Since it correctly handles a wide range of valid inputs, and I could not identify a scenario where it fails to meet the requirements, the solution is deemed correct.
