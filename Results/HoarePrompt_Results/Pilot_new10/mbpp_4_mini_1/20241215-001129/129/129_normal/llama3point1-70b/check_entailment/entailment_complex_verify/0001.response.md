The original assessment claims that the function is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `char` is not a single character. The assessment points out potential issues like raising an `IndexError` for an empty string and returning an incorrect ASCII value for multiple-character strings. However, the annotated version states that the state before the function call guarantees that `char` is a single character string.

Given the problem description and the assumption that input will always be valid, the function will correctly return the ASCII value of the character provided as input since it does not raise an error and returns the correct value as long as the input is as specified (a single character).

Thus, since the original assessment states that the function is incorrect without acknowledging the assumption of valid input, it can be determined that the assessment is not accurate.

Final: **True**
