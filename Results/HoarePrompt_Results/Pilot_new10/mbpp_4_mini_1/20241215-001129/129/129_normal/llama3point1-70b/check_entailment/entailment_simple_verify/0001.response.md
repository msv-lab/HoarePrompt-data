Final: **True**

The annotated version of the code clearly states that the input `char` is assumed to be a single character string, and the `ord(char)` function correctly returns the ASCII value of this character. The original assessment was based on concerns regarding cases where the input was not a single character, but since we are assuming valid input, those concerns are not applicable. Thus, under the assumption of valid input, the program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
