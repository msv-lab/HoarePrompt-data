#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode code point of the single character string 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII (Unicode code point) value. It does not handle any validation or error cases, so passing a non-single character string, an empty string, or a non-string type will lead to errors. However, if `char` is a valid single character, it accurately returns the corresponding ASCII value.
