Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description because it assumes that the input will always be a valid single character string. The function `func_1` will raise an error (specifically a `TypeError` or `IndexError`) if the input is an empty string, a string of length greater than one, or if the input is a non-string type (such as an integer, list, etc.). The problem description does not specify that the input will always be valid, and therefore the function lacks necessary validation.

In summary, while the function correctly computes the ASCII value for valid single character inputs, it fails to handle invalid inputs gracefully, meaning it cannot be deemed correct according to the problem description which implies the requirement for robustness against such cases.
