Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). 

- `math.hypot(x, y)` computes the radius \( r \) as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y), which is indeed the a correct formula for finding the radius in polar coordinates.
- `math.atan2(y, x)` computes the angle \( φ \) in radians, accounting for the signs of both \( x \) and \( y \) to determine the correct quadrant for the angle.

The implementation handles all cases, including those on the axes (e.g. when \( x \) is 0, \( y \) is 0, etc.), because `atan2` returns a proper angle in all scenarios.

Since the program outputs accurate and expected polar coordinates for any pair of rectangular coordinates, I find no edge cases or inputs that would cause it to fail the problem description. Thus, the code adheres strictly to the requirements, making it correct.
