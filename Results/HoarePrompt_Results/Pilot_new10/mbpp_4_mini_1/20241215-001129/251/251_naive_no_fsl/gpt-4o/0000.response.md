To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the function `func_1`, which is supposed to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. 

The conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ) is defined as follows:

- \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)
- \( θ = \text{atan2}(y, x) \)

The function implementation correctly uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the radius \( r \) and `math.atan2` to compute the angle \( θ \).

The provided assertions are:

1. `func_1(3, 4)` which should return approximately \( (5.0, 0.9272952180016122) \)
2. `func_1(4, 7)` which should return approximately \( (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738) \)
3. `func_1(15, 17)` which should return approximately \( (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057) \)

All of these assertions are testing valid inputs and seem to be returning the correct results based on the formulas above.

Let’s also consider edge cases:

1. When both x and y are zero: `func_1(0, 0)` should return \( (0, 0) \) because the radius \( r \) is zero, and the angle \( θ \) is undefined; however, traditionally in polar coordinates \( θ \) is set to 0.
2. When x is positive and y is zero: `func_1(5, 0)` should return \( (5, 0) \).
3. When x is negative and y is zero: `func_1(-5, 0)` should return \( (5, \pi) \).
4. When x is zero and y is positive: `func_1(0, 5)` should return \( (5, \frac{\pi}{2}) \).
5. When x is zero and y is negative: `func_1(0, -5)` should return \( (5, -\frac{\pi}{2}) \).

Upon testing these edge cases in the function:

- For `func_1(0, 0)`, it currently would return \( (0, 0) \), which works.
- For `func_1(5, 0)`, it returns \( (5.0, 0.0) \), which works.
- For `func_1(-5, 0)`, it would return \( (5.0, 3.141592653589793) \), which is correct.
- For `func_1(0, 5)`, it returns \( (5.0, 1.5707963267948966) \), which is correct.
- For `func_1(0, -5)`, it returns \( (5.0, -1.5707963267948966) \), which is correct.

Based on this thorough evaluation, all cases both standard and edge cases give the expected correct results according to the description of converting from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

Thus, the function behaves correctly for all the checks I performed.

Correctness: **True**
