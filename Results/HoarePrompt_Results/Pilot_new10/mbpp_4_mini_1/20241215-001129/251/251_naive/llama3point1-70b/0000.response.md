Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). 

1. The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to accurately compute the radius `r`, which is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y). This calculates \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).

2. The function uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to compute the angle φ in radians, taking into account the signs of both x and y to determine the correct quadrant for the angle as per the standard polar coordinate definitions.

3. It returns a tuple (r, φ), which matches the expectation for polar coordinates as specified in the problem description.

I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so the code is indeed correct.
