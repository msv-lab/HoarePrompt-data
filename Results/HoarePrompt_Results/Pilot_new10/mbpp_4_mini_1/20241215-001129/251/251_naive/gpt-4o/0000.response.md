Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) into polar coordinates (r, θ) using the formulas:
- r = √(x² + y²) (the radius)
- θ = atan2(y, x) (the angle)

The assertions provided further validate the function with specific inputs and expected outputs. The function should handle all potential cases, as:
- For all quadrants of the Cartesian plane, the radius will be correct since it is based on the Euclidean distance from the origin.
- The angle will also be correctly calculated as `atan2` takes into account the signs of both x and y to determine the correct quadrant.

Additionally, edge cases such as (0, 0) will return (0, 0) as expected. Overall, for any valid input of rectangular coordinates, the program operates as intended and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
