You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(3, 4) == (5.0, 0.9272952180016122)
assert func_1(4, 7) == (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057)

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, theta)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the function `func_1`, which is supposed to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. 

The conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ) is defined as follows:

- \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)
- \( θ = \text{atan2}(y, x) \)

The function implementation correctly uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the radius \( r \) and `math.atan2` to compute the angle \( θ \).

The provided assertions are:

1. `func_1(3, 4)` which should return approximately \( (5.0, 0.9272952180016122) \)
2. `func_1(4, 7)` which should return approximately \( (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738) \)
3. `func_1(15, 17)` which should return approximately \( (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057) \)

All of these assertions are testing valid inputs and seem to be returning the correct results based on the formulas above.

Let’s also consider edge cases:

1. When both x and y are zero: `func_1(0, 0)` should return \( (0, 0) \) because the radius \( r \) is zero, and the angle \( θ \) is undefined; however, traditionally in polar coordinates \( θ \) is set to 0.
2. When x is positive and y is zero: `func_1(5, 0)` should return \( (5, 0) \).
3. When x is negative and y is zero: `func_1(-5, 0)` should return \( (5, \pi) \).
4. When x is zero and y is positive: `func_1(0, 5)` should return \( (5, \frac{\pi}{2}) \).
5. When x is zero and y is negative: `func_1(0, -5)` should return \( (5, -\frac{\pi}{2}) \).

Upon testing these edge cases in the function:

- For `func_1(0, 0)`, it currently would return \( (0, 0) \), which works.
- For `func_1(5, 0)`, it returns \( (5.0, 0.0) \), which works.
- For `func_1(-5, 0)`, it would return \( (5.0, 3.141592653589793) \), which is correct.
- For `func_1(0, 5)`, it returns \( (5.0, 1.5707963267948966) \), which is correct.
- For `func_1(0, -5)`, it returns \( (5.0, -1.5707963267948966) \), which is correct.

Based on this thorough evaluation, all cases both standard and edge cases give the expected correct results according to the description of converting from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

Thus, the function behaves correctly for all the checks I performed.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two floating-point numbers, `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates, and calculates the radial coordinate `r` as the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) using the formula √(x² + y²). It also calculates the angle `theta` in radians using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which correctly handles all quadrants and edge cases, such as when `x` is 0, avoiding division by zero errors. The function returns both `r` and `theta`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
