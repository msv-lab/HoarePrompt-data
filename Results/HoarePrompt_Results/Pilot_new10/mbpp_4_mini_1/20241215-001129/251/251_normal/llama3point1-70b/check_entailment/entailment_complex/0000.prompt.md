You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
    #The program returns r, which is the hypotenuse calculated using the coordinates (x, y), and phi, which is the angle calculated using the coordinates (y, x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two real numbers, `x` and `y`, representing the rectangular coordinates, and returns a tuple containing `r`, the hypotenuse calculated using these coordinates, and `phi`, the angle in radians calculated using the coordinates `(y, x)`. It correctly computes the hypotenuse using the Cartesian coordinates, while the angle is derived from swapping the order of the input parameters, potentially leading to confusion regarding the expected coordinate relationships.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
