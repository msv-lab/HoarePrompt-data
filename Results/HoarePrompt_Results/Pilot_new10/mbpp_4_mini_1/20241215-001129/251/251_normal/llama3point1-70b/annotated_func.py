#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, phi
    #The program returns r, which is the hypotenuse calculated using the coordinates (x, y), and phi, which is the angle calculated using the coordinates (y, x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two real numbers, `x` and `y`, representing the rectangular coordinates, and returns a tuple containing `r`, the hypotenuse calculated using these coordinates, and `phi`, the angle in radians calculated using the coordinates `(y, x)`. It correctly computes the hypotenuse using the Cartesian coordinates, while the angle is derived from swapping the order of the input parameters, potentially leading to confusion regarding the expected coordinate relationships.
