Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi). 

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Rectangular to Polar Conversion**: The function receives two real numbers, x and y, which represent the rectangular coordinates. It calculates:
   - `r` using `math.hypot(x, y)`: This computes the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), which is the radius in polar coordinates.
   - `phi` using `math.atan2(y, x)`: This calculates the angle (in radians) from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y). This is the polar angle.

2. **Return Values**: The function returns both calculated values, (r, phi), as a tuple, which aligns with the requirement to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

Since the program incorporates the correct mathematical transformations and returns the expected results in all cases, it meets the problem's requirements. Thus, the correctness of the program is validated.
