Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by utilizing the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions. It calculates the maximum difference as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Hereâ€™s how it handles potential cases:

1. For an array with at least two numbers, it successfully finds the min and max values and calculates their difference.
2. It accommodates positive, negative, and mixed integers, as demonstrated in the provided assertions.
3. Edge cases such as an array of length 1 or arrays containing the same element will yield a maximum difference of 0. 

Since all examples work correctly and no examples of incorrect behavior can be devised based on the problem description, the code is deemed correct.
