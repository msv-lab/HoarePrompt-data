Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails when the input list `arr` is empty or contains non-integer values. As highlighted in the output hints, if `arr` is empty, the function will raise an exception due to the `min()` and `max()` functions being called on an empty list. Additionally, if non-integer values are present in the list, it will also lead to a potential exception when seeking the minimum or maximum values. Therefore, the implementation does not behave correctly for every potential input case, making it incorrect.
