Final: **False**

The original assessment states that the program is correct; however, the annotated version of the code indicates that the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-integer values. Since the maximum difference cannot be computed from an empty list (which would lead to an error because `min` and `max` functions cannot be applied to an empty iterable) or from a list containing non-integer values (which could raise exceptions), the program's behavior is undefined in those cases. Given these potential issues, the assessment of correctness was overly optimistic and not accurate given the annotations.
