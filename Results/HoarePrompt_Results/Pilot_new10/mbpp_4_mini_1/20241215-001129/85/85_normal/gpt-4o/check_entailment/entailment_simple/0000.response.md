Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements stated in the problem description. The task is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**: The function `func_1` computes the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) from the input array `arr`.

2. **Calculating the Difference**: It then calculates the difference between `max_val` and `min_val` (`max_diff`). This difference represents the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the list, since the largest possible difference in a set of numbers is between the maximum and minimum values.

3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, it returns the calculated difference.

The function is valid for any array of integers, including edge cases where:
- The array contains all identical values (the result will be 0).
- The array has both negative and positive numbers (the maximum difference will still be accurately calculated).
- The array has only one element (the max difference will also be 0, as there is no second element to compare).

Since the program accurately computes the maximum difference according to the problem description in all cases, it is correct.
