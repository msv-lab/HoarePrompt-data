Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description under all potential cases. While the function correctly calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a list of integers, it fails to handle the following scenarios:

1. **Empty List**: If the input list `arr` is empty, calling `min(arr)` and `max(arr)` will raise a `ValueError` because there are no elements to find a minimum or maximum from.

2. **Non-integer Values**: The function does not check for non-integer values in the list. If `arr` contains any non-integer elements, it could raise a `TypeError` when attempting to calculate `min(arr)` and `max(arr)`.

For these reasons, the function does not follow the problem description accurately, as it does not define behavior for invalid inputs or those outlined above. Thus, the program cannot be deemed correct for all potential cases as required by the problem description.
