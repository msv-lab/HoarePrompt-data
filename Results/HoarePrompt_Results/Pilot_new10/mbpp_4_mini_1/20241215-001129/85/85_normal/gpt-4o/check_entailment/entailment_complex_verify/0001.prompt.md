You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

The function `func_1(arr)` does the following:
1. It computes the minimum value in the array using `min(arr)`.
2. It computes the maximum value in the array using `max(arr)`.
3. It calculates the difference between these two values with `max_val - min_val`.

This approach correctly identifies the maximum difference because the difference will always be the highest when subtracting the smallest element from the largest element in the array.

The assertions provided cover various scenarios:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1`, the maximum is `5`, and thus the difference is `4`, which matches the assertion.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, leading to a difference of `8`, which is also correct.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, resulting in a difference of `2`, consistent with the assertion.

All handled cases correctly follow the problem description, and no missing edge cases appear based on the provided logic. 

Thus, the code is overall correct in its implementation for the given problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list 'arr', which is equal to max_val - min_val
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum difference between the maximum value and minimum value in the list. It does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains non-integer values, which could lead to errors. Therefore, if `arr` is empty, the behavior is undefined, and if it contains non-integers, it will raise an exception.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
