Based on the problem description, the function `func_1(arr)` correctly implements the requirement to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array. 

The original assessment noted that the function does not handle edge cases for an empty list, which would indeed raise a `ValueError` when attempting to calculate `max(arr)` or `min(arr)`. However, the program is assessed in the context of assuming valid input as stated, which means we acknowledge that it operates correctly under the given assumptions. 

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function operates as expected when an appropriate list is provided and does not raise issues when those assumptions hold.

Therefore, considering all the information provided:

- The function works correctly when valid input is supplied.
- The risk of a `ValueError` due to an empty list does not detract from the correctness given the input assumptions.

Final: **True**
