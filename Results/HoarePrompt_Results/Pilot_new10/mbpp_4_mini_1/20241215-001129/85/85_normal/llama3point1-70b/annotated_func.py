#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. However, if `arr` is empty, calling `max()` or `min()` will raise a ValueError. Therefore, the function does not handle the edge case of an empty list. If `arr` is empty, an error will occur.
