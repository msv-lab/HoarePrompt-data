Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case of an empty array, which results in a `ValueError` when `max` or `min` is called on an empty list. This oversight is aligned with the program description that states it should work for "any" given array. Therefore, the conclusion that the program is incorrect based on the analysis is accurate.
