To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the function implementation:

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

### Analysis of the Program

The provided function `func_1(n)` uses a generator expression to calculate the cube of even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2`. This is the intended behavior according to the problem description, which asks for the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

- **Range Calculation:** The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` function generates even numbers:
  - When `n = 1`: Generates [2]
  - When `n = 2`: Generates [2, 4]
  - When `n = 3`: Generates [2, 4, 6]
  - And so on...
  
These values represent the first `n` even natural numbers.

- **Cubing and Summation:** The expression `(i ** 3 for i in ...)` correctly computes the cube of each even number, and `sum(...)` sums them together.

### Edge Cases to Consider

1. **Input `n < 1`:** 
   - For `n = 0`, there are no even natural numbers to consider, meaning the sum should be 0.
   - For negative inputs (`n < 0`), it doesn't make sense in the context of "first n even natural numbers"; the function could take such input and return `0`.

### Handling Edge Cases

The implementation does not explicitly handle the case when `n` is less than 1:
- For `n = 0`, the function will return `0` because it does not iterate through any numbers.
- For negative `n`, it will still return `0` for lack of any even numbers generated.

Thus, we do not find a contradiction in the program for positive and valid inputs, nor do we find a case where it would misleadingly produce incorrect results for legitimate inputs of `n >= 0`.

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing:
- The function accurately computes the cube sum for all valid positive integers `n`.
- It also correctly handles `n = 0` and returns `0`.

Correctness: **True** 

The function meets all conditions set forth in the problem description.
