To evaluate the given program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

**Problem description**: The task is to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. This means that for a given non-negative integer `n`, we should calculate the sum of the cubes of the even numbers from 2 up to 2 times `n`.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

**Output hints**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to 2*n, inclusive.

### Analysis:
- The range function `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers starting from 2 and going up to (and including) `2*n` when `n` is a non-negative integer.
- The generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` correctly computes the cube of each even number generated by the range.
- The `sum` function then totals these cubes.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `n = 0`, we expect the sum of the cubes of the first 0 even natural numbers to be 0:
   - For `n = 0`, the range will be `range(2, 1, 2)`, which produces no numbers, resulting in a sum of 0 (which is correct).
   
2. If `n = 1`, we expect the sum of the cube of the first even number (2):
   - Here, the range will be `range(2, 3, 2)` which includes only the number 2. The cube of 2 is 8, and thus the sum returns 8 (which is correct).
   
3. For higher values of `n`, we can check:
   - For `n = 2`: The sum targets in range are 2 and 4. The cubes are \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\) (which is correct).
   - For `n = 3`: The sum of cubes will be \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\) (which is correct).

### Conclusion:
The code effectively and correctly implements the logic to find the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The output hints indicate it includes the proper calculations and edge cases handling. All expected outputs for various values of `n` yield correct results.

Correctness: **True**.
