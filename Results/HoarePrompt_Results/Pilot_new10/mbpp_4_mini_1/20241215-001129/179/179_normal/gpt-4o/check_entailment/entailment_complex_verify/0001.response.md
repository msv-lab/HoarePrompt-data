Final: **True**

The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program is incorrect. Upon reviewing the annotated code and the problem description, the program indeed computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers accurately. The function takes a non-negative integer `n`, generates the first `n` even numbers, and correctly calculates their cube sum.

The assertions provided in the program confirm that `func_1(2)`, `func_1(3)`, and `func_1(4)` return correct results of 72, 288, and 800 respectively. Since the annotations specify that the input is expected to be a non-negative integer, the lack of error handling for negative or zero values is not an issue given the assumption that the input will be valid.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the calculations confirmed by both the assertions and the annotations, the program is correct.
