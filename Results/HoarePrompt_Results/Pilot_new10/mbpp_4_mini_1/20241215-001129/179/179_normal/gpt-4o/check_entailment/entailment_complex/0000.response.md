To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's break down both the description and the program functionality:

### Problem Description
The task is to write a Python function that finds the **cube sum of the first n even natural numbers**. This means we need to:

1. Identify the first n even natural numbers, which are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.
2. Compute the cube of each of these numbers.
3. Return the sum of these cubes.

### Annotated Program Review
Here’s how the annotated program operates:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is defined to accept a non-negative integer `n`.
2. **Even Numbers Generation**: The line `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` generates the first n even natural numbers. For instance:
   - For `n = 1`, it generates `[2]`.
   - For `n = 2`, it generates `[2, 4]`.
   - For `n = 3`, it generates `[2, 4, 6]`, and so on.
3. **Cube Calculation**: The line `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated `cube_sum`.

### Testing with Assertions
The assertions provided aim to test the correctness:
- `func_1(2)` returns `72`, which is the cube sum of `[2, 4]` → \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- `func_1(3)` returns `288`, which is the cube sum of `[2, 4, 6]` → \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
- `func_1(4)` returns `800`, which is the cube sum of `[2, 4, 6, 8]` → \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).

### Conclusion
Since the function correctly identifies the first n even natural numbers, computes their cubes, and then sums those cubes, it adheres to the problem description without any exception cases that have been mentioned.

Correctness: **True**
