The original assessment concluded that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1. The reasoning pointed out that for inputs like `func_1(0)`, the function returns `0` without raising an error, which is seen as not fulfilling the problem's requirement of computing for the "first n even natural numbers". 

However, the output hints clarify that the function is intended to accept a non-negative integer `n`, implying that it is acceptable for `n` to be `0`. According to these hints, when `n` is `0`, the function returns `0`, which is consistent with there being no even numbers to sum. The problem description does not explicitly state how the function should behave when `n` is less than 1, but the output hints suggest that it is acceptable to return `0` for these cases.

Thus, the function is correctly calculating the cube sum for valid positive integers and behaves appropriately for `n=0`, suggesting the original assessment may not be accurate.

Final: **True**
