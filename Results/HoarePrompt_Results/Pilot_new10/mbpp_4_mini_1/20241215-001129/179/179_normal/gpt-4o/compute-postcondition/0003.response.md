The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it calculates `cube_sum`, which is equal to the sum of the cubes of the even numbers from 2 to 2*n. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the sum of the cubes of all even numbers from 2 to 2*n.
