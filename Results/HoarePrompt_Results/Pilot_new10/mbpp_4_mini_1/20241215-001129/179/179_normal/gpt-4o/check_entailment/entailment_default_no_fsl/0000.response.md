Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers, calculates their cubes, and sums them. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The function computes the first `n` even natural numbers using the formula `2 * i` where `i` ranges from `1` to `n`. This correctly generates the list of even numbers as `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]`.

2. It then calculates the sum of their cubes correctly by iterating over the list of even numbers and summing each number raised to the power of 3.

3. The function handles the specified non-negative integers as input, and since it's stated that `n` will be a non-negative integer, there is no need for additional error handling.

4. The output hints confirm that the function produces the correct output for the specified test cases:
   - `func_1(2)` returns `72`, which is the correct sum of cubes of `2` and `4`.
   - `func_1(3)` returns `288`, the correct sum of cubes of `2`, `4`, and `6`.
   - `func_1(4)` returns `800`, also accurate for the cubes of `2`, `4`, `6`, and `8`.

Since the function returns the expected output for the defined cases and behaves correctly for all non-negative integer inputs as stated in the problem description, the program is correct for the given requirements.
