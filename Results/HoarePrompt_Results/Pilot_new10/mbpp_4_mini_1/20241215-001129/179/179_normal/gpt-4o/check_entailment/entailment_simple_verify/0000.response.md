Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment accurately identified that the function `func_1` does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1, which is an important aspect of the problem description regarding "first n even natural numbers." The expected behavior of the function should ideally accommodate non-positive values for `n`, either by raising an error or handling it explicitly, as it is implied that `n` should start from `1`. Although the provided annotations confirm that the function does compute the cube sum for valid inputs correctly, the omission of handling non-positive integers still suggests that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description fully. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
