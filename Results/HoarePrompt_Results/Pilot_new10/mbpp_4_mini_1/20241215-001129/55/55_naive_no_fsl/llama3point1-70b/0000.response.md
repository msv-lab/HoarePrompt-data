To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem of converting a snake_case string to camelCase. 

### Problem Analysis
- **Snake Case:** A string format where words are connected by underscores (_) and typically use lowercase letters (e.g., `snake_case_string`).
- **Camel Case:** A string format where the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no underscores (e.g., `SnakeCaseString`).

### Function Analysis
The provided function `func_1` performs the following steps:
1. It splits the input snake case string using underscores as the delimiter, resulting in a list of words.
2. It capitalizes each word using the `capitalize()` method.
3. It joins the capitalized words into a single string and returns this as the output.

### Potential Issues to Check
1. **Input with Leading or Trailing Underscores:** If the input string has leading or trailing underscores (e.g., `_snake_case_`), the original function will produce incorrect results, creating an empty leading word or an empty word at the end.
   
   - Example: `func_1("_snake_case_")` would give `SnakeCase`, but the expected output should have been `SnakeCase` with valid handling for unexpected underscores.

2. **Consecutive Underscores:** If the string contains consecutive underscores (e.g., `snake__case`), the function would treat the consecutive underscores as creating empty words, leading to incorrect capitalization.
   
   - Example: `func_1("snake__case")` would yield `SnakeCase`, but it should ideally handle that situation correctly.

3. **Empty String Input:** An empty string input should be handled gracefully.
   
   - Example: `func_1("")` will return an empty string, which may or may not be the desired behavior depending on interpretation.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the function does not correctly handle cases with leading/trailing underscores, consecutive underscores, and potentially empty string inputs based on common expectations for the function's behavior. 

As a result, we find that the program does not meet the requirements as per the problem description for all potential input cases.

Correctness: **False**
