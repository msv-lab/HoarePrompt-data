Correctness: **False**.

The program has a logic issue when it comes to handling empty strings. If an empty string (`""`) is passed to the function `func_1`, it will return an empty string, but according to the problem description, the function should convert a snake case string to a camel case string. The expected output for an empty snake case string does not match with the expected behavior of converting such strings, potentially leading to incorrect results in the context of the problem description. 

For example:
`func_1('')` would return `''`, but there's no defined handling in terms of specification for empty input in the given problem description. Under typical expectations, this may be undesired behavior.

Therefore, since the program does not handle the empty string case correctly, the correctness is proven to be false.
