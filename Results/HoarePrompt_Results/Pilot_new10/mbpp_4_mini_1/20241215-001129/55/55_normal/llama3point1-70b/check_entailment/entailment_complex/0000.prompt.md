You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_case_str is a string that contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, and does not start or end with an underscore.
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    return camel_case_str
    #The program returns camel_case_str, which is the result of concatenating the capitalized elements of the list 'words' derived from the snake_case_str string containing only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `snake_case_str` that contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, and converts it to camel case format by capitalizing the first letter of each word separated by underscores and concatenating them. If `snake_case_str` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string as well.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
