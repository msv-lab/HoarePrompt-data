You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
Program:
```
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem of converting a snake_case string to camelCase. 

### Problem Analysis
- **Snake Case:** A string format where words are connected by underscores (_) and typically use lowercase letters (e.g., `snake_case_string`).
- **Camel Case:** A string format where the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no underscores (e.g., `SnakeCaseString`).

### Function Analysis
The provided function `func_1` performs the following steps:
1. It splits the input snake case string using underscores as the delimiter, resulting in a list of words.
2. It capitalizes each word using the `capitalize()` method.
3. It joins the capitalized words into a single string and returns this as the output.

### Potential Issues to Check
1. **Input with Leading or Trailing Underscores:** If the input string has leading or trailing underscores (e.g., `_snake_case_`), the original function will produce incorrect results, creating an empty leading word or an empty word at the end.
   
   - Example: `func_1("_snake_case_")` would give `SnakeCase`, but the expected output should have been `SnakeCase` with valid handling for unexpected underscores.

2. **Consecutive Underscores:** If the string contains consecutive underscores (e.g., `snake__case`), the function would treat the consecutive underscores as creating empty words, leading to incorrect capitalization.
   
   - Example: `func_1("snake__case")` would yield `SnakeCase`, but it should ideally handle that situation correctly.

3. **Empty String Input:** An empty string input should be handled gracefully.
   
   - Example: `func_1("")` will return an empty string, which may or may not be the desired behavior depending on interpretation.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the function does not correctly handle cases with leading/trailing underscores, consecutive underscores, and potentially empty string inputs based on common expectations for the function's behavior. 

As a result, we find that the program does not meet the requirements as per the problem description for all potential input cases.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string `snake_case_str` that contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, and converts it to camel case format by capitalizing the first letter of each word separated by underscores and concatenating them. If `snake_case_str` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string as well. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
