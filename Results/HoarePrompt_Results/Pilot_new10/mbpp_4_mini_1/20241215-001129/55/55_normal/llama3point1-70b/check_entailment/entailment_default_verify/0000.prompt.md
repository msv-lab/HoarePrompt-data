You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
Program:
```
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string starts with an underscore or contains consecutive underscores. For example:

- Input: `"_my_var"` should return `"MyVar"`, but the current function would return `"MyVar"` which is correct.
- Input: `"my__variable"` should produce `"MyVariable"` according to camel case rules (where only single underscores separate words), but the function will return `"MyVariable"` without addressing that `my__variable` implies a potential error in naming convention.

Additionally, if the input string is empty or contains only underscores (like `"___"`), the function will return an empty string, which is not specified in the problem description and may not be what is expected. Thus, the program doesn't handle edge cases correctly.

Therefore, since it does not correctly process all edge cases, the function is deemed incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string `snake_case_str` that contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, and converts it to camel case format by capitalizing the first letter of each word separated by underscores and concatenating them. If `snake_case_str` is an empty string, the function returns an empty string as well. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
