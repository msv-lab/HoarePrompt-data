The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `snake_str`. `snake_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, with at least one underscore present. The function returns a string that is formed by capitalizing each substring obtained from splitting `snake_str` at the underscores and then joining these capitalized substrings. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to take a string `snake_str` and convert it into a format where each component, separated by underscores, is capitalized and concatenated into a single string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter snake_str, which is a string containing lowercase letters and underscores, and returns a string formed by capitalizing the substrings obtained from splitting snake_str at the underscores.**
