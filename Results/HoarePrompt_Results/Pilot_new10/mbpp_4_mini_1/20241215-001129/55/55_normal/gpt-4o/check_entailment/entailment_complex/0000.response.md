The provided function `func_1` is intended to convert a snake case string to a camel case string, and it operates under the precondition that the input string (`snake_str`) consists of lowercase letters and underscores, with at least one underscore present.

### Analysis of the Function:

1. **Functionality**:
   - The function splits the input string by underscores (`_`), which correctly identifies the components of the snake case format.
   - It then capitalizes each component and joins them together without any spaces, achieving the camel case format.

2. **Correctness with Given Examples**: 
   - The function is validated with a few assertions:
     - `func_1('python_program')` gives `'PythonProgram'`.
     - `func_1('python_language')` gives `'PythonLanguage'`.
     - `func_1('programming_language')` gives `'ProgrammingLanguage'`.
   - All these examples align with the expected output for converting snake case to camel case.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The precondition states there will always be at least one underscore in the input string. Thus, there will be at least two components to capitalize and combine.
   - There are no checks for an empty string or strings with leading or trailing underscores, but as per the stated precondition, such cases will not occur.
   - Therefore, the function correctly capitalizes the first letter of each component and ignores any invalid cases as they are out of the defined constraints.

### Conclusion:
The implementation adheres to the problem description and correctly converts snake case strings to camel case. Given the constraints and the examples provided, the function behaves correctly across expected input scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
