Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It accomplishes this by concatenating the three lists into one combined list and then sorting that list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This approach will handle various input scenarios, including duplicate values and different ranges of integers.

The test cases provided are sufficient to demonstrate the function's correctness across a range of possible inputs. 

If I consider different scenarios, such as:
- All lists being empty
- Lists containing negative numbers
- Lists of varying lengths

The implementation would still yield a correct sorted result in these cases. Since no potential edge case where the function fails can be identified based on the problem description, the program meets the requirements as specified. Thus, the overall correctness of the program is confirmed.
