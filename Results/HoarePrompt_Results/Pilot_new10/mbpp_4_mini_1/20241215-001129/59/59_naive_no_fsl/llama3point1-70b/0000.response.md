Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`), concatenates them, and then returns a single sorted list. The use of the Python built-in `sorted()` function ensures that the output will be a correctly sorted list, regardless of the order and content of the input lists.

In all potential cases, the function should handle:

1. Cases where the input lists are empty.
2. Cases where the input lists contain varying data types (assuming they can be compared, e.g., all integers or all strings).
3. Cases where the lists have overlapping values or are identical.

Since the resulting list will always be sorted as a result of the `sorted()` function, the program adheres to the problem description. Thus, the program is correct, and no potential case has been identified that would lead it to produce an incorrect result.
