Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately concludes that the program is correct. The provided function `func_1` successfully merges three lists into a single sorted list by concatenating the lists and using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which is expected to handle duplicate values and varied integer ranges effectively.

The annotated version of the code reaffirms this, clearly stating the initial state of the input lists and the operations performed within the function. It confirms that the merged and sorted output meets the specified requirements of the problem description.

Additionally, the test cases demonstrate successful handling of a variety of scenarios, including lists with duplicates and different lengths. Thus, the conclusion of overall correctness remains valid based on both the problem description and the annotations provided.
