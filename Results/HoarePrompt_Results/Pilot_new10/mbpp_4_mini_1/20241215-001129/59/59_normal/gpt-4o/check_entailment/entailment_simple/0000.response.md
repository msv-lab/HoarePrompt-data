Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description requirements to merge three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why:

1. **Combining Lists**: The function `func_1` takes three lists as input parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. It correctly merges these lists by using the `+` operator, resulting in `combined_list` which contains all elements from the three input lists.

2. **Sorting the Combined List**: The function then sorts this combined list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which returns a new list containing all the items from the combined list in ascending order.

3. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns this sorted list, which is the desired output as specified in the problem description.

The assertions provided in the annotated program validate the correctness of the output for various test cases. The function handles different scenarios, including duplicates and varying lengths of the input lists, and consistently produces a single sorted list.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description's requirements.
