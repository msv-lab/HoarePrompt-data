#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of integers.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list that is the concatenation of list1, list2, and list3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list that is the concatenation of these three input lists. There are no checks for the types of the input parameters, so if any of the inputs are not lists or contain non-integer types, a TypeError may occur.
