Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed takes a list as input and converts it to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. According to the annotations, the function works fluently with any valid list input and handles edge cases like empty lists by returning an empty tuple. Since we assume that the input will always be a valid list, the lack of input validation does not impact the correctness of the function. Thus, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description, confirming the original assessment as correct.
