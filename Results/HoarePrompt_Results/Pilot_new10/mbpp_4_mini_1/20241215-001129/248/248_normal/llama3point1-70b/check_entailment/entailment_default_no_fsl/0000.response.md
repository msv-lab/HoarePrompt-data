Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the problem description, as it does not restrict the input to only lists. According to the output hints, the function can accept any iterable and convert it to a tuple, which is beyond the requirement of the problem stating that it should convert a list to a tuple. 

For instance, if a user were to pass a string (which is also an iterable in Python), the function would return a tuple of individual characters in that string:

```python
func_1("abc")  # This would return ('a', 'b', 'c')
```

This behavior contradicts the problem statement which specifies that the input should be a list. Hence, the function does not operate correctly according to the problem description for every potential case. Thus, it is incorrect.
