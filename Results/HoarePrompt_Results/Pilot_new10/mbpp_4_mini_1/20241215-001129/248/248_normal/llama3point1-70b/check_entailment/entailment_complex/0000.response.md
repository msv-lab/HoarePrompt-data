Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to convert a list to a tuple. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `input_list`, which is intended to be a list, as stated in the pre-function comment.

2. **Tuple Conversion**: The return statement uses `tuple(input_list)`, which effectively converts the input list into a tuple. This directly supports the problem requirement to transform a list into a tuple.

3. **Handles Any Iterable**: The function can convert any iterable into a tuple, not just lists. However, since lists are a specific type of iterable, and the problem does not restrict the function to only handle lists, this behavior does not violate the problem requirements. It adds flexibility to the function.

4. **Empty Input**: If an empty list is provided, the function returns an empty tuple, which is also the expected behavior as per the problem description.

Overall, the implementation follows the problem requirements and handles the specified cases appropriately, hence the result is correct.
