Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identified the program as correct. The function `func_1` effectively converts a given list to a tuple, and the annotated states confirm that `input_list` is indeed a list, which aligns with the problem description. The built-in `tuple()` function can handle all types of lists, including empty lists, ensuring that the implementation fully meets the requirements of the task. Thus, no inaccuracies were found in the original assessment.
