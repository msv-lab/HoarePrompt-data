Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function, and the annotated version supports this by affirming that the input is indeed a list and that it returns a tuple created from it. Given the assumption that the input will always be valid, there are no errors to be concerned about. The function behaves as specified in all described cases.
