Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality of converting a list to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor. The assertions provided test the function against various cases, and all tests return the expected outputs. 

The output hints confirm that the function works as intended: it accepts input lists of any data type, correctly processes empty lists by returning an empty tuple, and the assumption that only valid input will be supplied ensures that edge cases related to input type are not a concern.

Since the problem description is fulfilled and no logical errors are observed, I maintain that the program is correct in its implementation.
