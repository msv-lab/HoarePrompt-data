Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all the elements of that list. This behavior is confirmed by the assertions, which demonstrate that the function produces the expected output for various lists, including those containing different integers and an empty list.

The output hints also align with the program's functionality: it states that the function accepts a list of any data type and will return a tuple with those elements, as well as returning an empty tuple if the input list is empty.

Since the program works correctly for all the cases described, including the edge case of an empty list, we can conclude that the implementation fully meets the problem requirements.
