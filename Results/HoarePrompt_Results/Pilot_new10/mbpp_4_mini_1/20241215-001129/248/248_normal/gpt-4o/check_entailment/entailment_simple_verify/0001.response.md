Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` successfully converts a list to a tuple using the appropriate `tuple()` constructor, which is the required functionality as per the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly handles lists of any data type and fulfills the assertion tests provided. Since there are no logical flaws or unhandled edge cases within the assumptions made (valid input), the function performs as expected in all aspects.
