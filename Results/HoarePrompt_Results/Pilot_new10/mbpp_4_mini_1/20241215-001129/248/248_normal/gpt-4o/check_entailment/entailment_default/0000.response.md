Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(lst)` correctly converts a provided list `lst` into a tuple, as specified in the problem description. The function handles various cases, including lists of different lengths and data types, as showcased in the provided assertions. The output hints confirm that the function operates correctlyâ€”returning a tuple containing all elements from the list and returning an empty tuple when the input list is empty. Since all potential cases outlined in the problem description are handled correctly, the implementation is considered correct.
