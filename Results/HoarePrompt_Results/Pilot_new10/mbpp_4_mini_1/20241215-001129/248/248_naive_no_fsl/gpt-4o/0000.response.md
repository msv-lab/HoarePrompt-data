Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list as input and converts it to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor, which is the correct method for this conversion in Python.

The assertions provided test the function with various lists, and all expected outputs match what the function returns.

There are no missing logical cases or edge cases noticed since:
- The function correctly handles empty lists, which would return an empty tuple `()`.
- It also works with lists containing mixed data types (if such are passed to the function), as tuples can contain elements of different types.

Since I cannot think of any input case where the function would fail to convert a list to a tuple as required by the problem description, the program appears to be correct in its implementation.
