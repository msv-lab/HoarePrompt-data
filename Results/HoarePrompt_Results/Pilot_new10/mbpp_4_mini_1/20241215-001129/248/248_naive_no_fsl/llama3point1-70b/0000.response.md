Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes an input list and converts it into a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. The program should work correctly for all potential cases as follows:

1. An empty list: `func_1([])` returns `()`, which is the expected result.
2. A list with one element: `func_1([1])` returns `(1,)`, which is the expected result.
3. A list with multiple elements: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `(1, 2, 3)`, which is as expected.
4. A list containing mixed data types: `func_1([1, 'a', 3.14])` returns `(1, 'a', 3.14)`, which is still correct.
5. A list of nested lists: `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]])` returns `([1, 2], [3, 4])`, which is handled correctly.

The program correctly implements the specification to convert a list into a tuple for all valid inputs, and thus is correct in all cases. Therefore, there are no edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to meet the problem description.
