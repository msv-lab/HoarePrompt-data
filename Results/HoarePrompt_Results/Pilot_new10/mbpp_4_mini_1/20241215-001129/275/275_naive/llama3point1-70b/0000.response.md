To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the corresponding code.

**Problem description:** Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Basic Functionality**:
    - The function starts by checking if the input list `nums` is empty; if it is, it returns `0`, which is correct since there are no subsets in an empty list.
    - It sorts the list, which is necessary for checking divisibility in a structured manner.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
    - The function employs dynamic programming where `dp[i]` is used to store the size of the largest divisible subset that includes `nums[i]`.
    - For each `nums[i]`, it checks all previous numbers `nums[j]` to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, updating `dp[i]` accordingly.

3. **Finding the Maximum**:
    - At the end, it returns the maximum size found across all `dp` entries.

### Potential Case to Consider:
Now, let's think through different inputs and check if there are any edge cases or scenarios where the function might fail to meet the requirements:

- **Example Input**: [5, 10, 15, 20]
  - Possible pairs: (5, 10), (5, 15), (5, 20), (10, 20)
  - The largest subset where every pair is divisible could include all numbers (all are divisible by 5), making the output `4`. Expected output is `4`, which matches with what the code should return.
  
- **Example Input**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
  - Every number in this set has a divisor and can be arranged to form larger subsets. A valid subset could be (1, 2, 4, 12), output should be `4` which is correct.

- **Example Input**: [3, 6, 9] 
  - The expected largest divisible subset can have `3` when paired with both `6` and `9`, again making the expected output `3`.

### Special Cases:
- Edge case with an empty array: correctly returns `0`.
- All primes: e.g., `[2, 3, 5]` returns `1` since individual numbers can't divide each other, which is the expected output.
- All numbers are multiples of a certain number: e.g., `[2, 4, 8]` would yield a subset size of `3` which works as expected.

After analyzing the code against potential edge cases and logical checks, it appears that the code correctly achieves the goals described in the prompt for all tested scenarios, and no bugs or edge cases lead to incorrect results.

### Final Determination:
Correctness: **True**.
This implementation correctly identifies the largest subset size of numbers where every pair is divisible across all potential input scenarios analyzed.
