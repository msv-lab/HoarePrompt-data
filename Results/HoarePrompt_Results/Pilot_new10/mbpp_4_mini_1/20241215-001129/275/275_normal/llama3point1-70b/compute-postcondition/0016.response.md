Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` contains the lengths of divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, and `i` is the length of `nums`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by any `nums[j]` for `j < i`, then `dp[i]` will be greater than 1; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains 1. The value of `dp` represents the maximum length of the divisible subsequence ending at each index.**
