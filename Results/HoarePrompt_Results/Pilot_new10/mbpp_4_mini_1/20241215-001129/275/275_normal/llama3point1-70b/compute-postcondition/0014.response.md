The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` assigns the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` to `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, the impact of this code will affect the value of `dp[2]`.

We know:
- `dp[i]` refers to `dp[2]`
- `dp[j]` refers to `dp[1]`

Thus, the new value of `dp[2]` will be `max(dp[2], dp[1] + 1)`. The other variables (`nums`, `i`, and `j`) are unaffected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp[2]` is updated to max(dp[2], dp[1] + 1).**
