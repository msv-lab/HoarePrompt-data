According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which iterates from 0 up to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means that on the next execution, `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1 (so that `range(i)` includes at least 1).

Since `i` is greater than 0, it implies that `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to have additional iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be unchanged (as the body of the loop will not affect `i`) and `j` should be updated to the next value, which would be 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` contains the lengths of divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
