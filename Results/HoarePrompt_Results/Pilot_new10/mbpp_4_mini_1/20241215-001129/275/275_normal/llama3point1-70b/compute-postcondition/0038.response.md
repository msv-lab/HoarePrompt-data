The line of code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` will update the value at index `i` of the list `dp`. The value of `dp[i]` will be assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j]` incremented by 1. Therefore, the specific change made will reflect how `dp[i]` gets updated based on the values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`.

Given that `i` has already been incremented, we'll maintain the previous state for `nums` and `dp`, but we need to update `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is now updated, `dp` is updated such that `dp[i]` is now the maximum of the previous `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.**
