According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which indicates how many elements have been considered in the `nums` list. Since `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`, the loop can execute again if `j` can take on the next value in this range. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `j` is at its maximum value of `i-1`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1. Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, the updated value of `i` must now be `i + 1`, where `i` is still valid according to the size of `nums`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will reset to 0 and `i` must be adjusted accordingly. Hence, the condition for `nums` remains the same, and `dp` could potentially still be recalculated given the new value of `i`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is now updated to `i + 1`, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
