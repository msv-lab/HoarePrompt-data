The statement `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the maximum between its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. The variables `nums` and `dp` remain unchanged, while `j` is set to the current value of `i`. The result will depend on the existing values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`. Since `i` must be at least 1, we can assume that there is a valid value for both `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` remains unchanged; `j` is `i`; `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
