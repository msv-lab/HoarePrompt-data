According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `i-1`, meaning that if `i` is at least `1`, the loop can execute once more for the next value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `j` would have been `i - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `i`. So, we also need to ensure that `i` must be greater than `1` to allow for an additional iteration of the loop (which means `i` must be incremented by 1 overall).

Thus, we can summarize it as follows: at the end of the last iteration, `i` is unchanged. For the next potential loop iteration, we want to set `j` to `i`, and `i` must remain unchanged in its constraints. The length of `nums` does not affect the loop condition directly but should also be acknowledged.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` remains unchanged; `j` is `i`, `i` must be at least 1**
