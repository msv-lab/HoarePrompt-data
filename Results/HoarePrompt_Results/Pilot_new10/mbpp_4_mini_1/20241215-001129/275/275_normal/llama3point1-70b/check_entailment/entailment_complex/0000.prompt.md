You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 since the current value of `nums` is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers, and `nums` is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, and each `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of the divisible subsequence ending with `nums[i]` based on the earlier elements in `nums`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequences stored in the list `dp`, which corresponds to the longest such subsequence that can be formed with the elements of the sorted list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums`, returns 0 if `nums` is empty, and if not, it returns the length of the longest subsequence in which each pair of elements satisfies the divisibility condition. This subsequence is determined by examining the sorted list of integers and leveraging a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum length of such subsequences.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
