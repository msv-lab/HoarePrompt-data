The variable `dp` is assigned a list containing the value `1` repeated for the length of `nums`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers and is not empty, `len(nums)` will be a positive integer, and thus `dp` will become a list of `1`s with the same length as `nums`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `nums` is not empty; `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` filled with the value `1`.**
