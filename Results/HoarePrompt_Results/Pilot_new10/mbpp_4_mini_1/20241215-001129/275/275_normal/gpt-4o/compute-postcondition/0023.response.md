The expression `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value at index `i` of the list `dp`. Since `i` must be at least 2 and `j` is 1, we assume that index `j` is valid within the context. The `max` function compares the existing value at `dp[i]` with `dp[j] + 1` and assigns the higher value to `dp[i]`.

Assuming that `dp[i]` has an initial value, let's denote it as `dp[i]`_old and `dp[j]` as `dp[1]`, the result will be the maximum of those two values. The other variables, `nums`, `i`, and `j`, are unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` is updated; `i` is at least 2; `j` is 1; `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`.**
