According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` because the loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j < i`. At the end of the last iteration, since `dp` is updated based on `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, we need to ensure that there is still a valid range for `j`.

The information states that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, but we don't know the exact length of `nums`. However, if `i` has been previously defined such that it is at least 1, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increase. Therefore, `j` will take on values from `0` to `i-1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 1.

At the end of the last iteration indicated, `j` has reached the value of `i - 1`. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should now be `i`, and consequently, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to iterate again.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` is updated, `i` must be greater than 1, `j` is `i`, and the values of `dp` can be recalculated based on the updated `i`.**
