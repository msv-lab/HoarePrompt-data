According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0. Since in the given state `i` is 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `i` is at least 1. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with length equal to the length of `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0**
