According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop is determined by the range from 0 to `i - 1`, as `j` is iterating over this range. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase; thus, `j` will take a new value. At the end of the last iteration, we know `i` is greater than `j + 1`, meaning `j` was at least `i - 2` during the last iteration. So, to execute the loop one more time, `j` should be incremented.

As the last valid value for `j` was `i - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be at least 2, allowing `j` to take values from `0` to `i - 1`. If `i` is currently `k`, then for the next iteration, we would need `j` to be at least `k` and `i` must remain unchanged.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with length equal to `nums`, `i` must be at least 2, `j` is at least `i - 1**
