Correctness: **False**

The provided function is supposed to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. However, the function sorts the list and uses a dynamic programming approach that checks if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for `i` and `j`. This only finds sequences where higher index elements are multiples of lower index ones, but it does not correctly account for all potential subsets where every pair must be divisible (the condition is not symmetric). 

A counter-example is a list with various multiples, such as `nums = [1, 2, 4, 8]`. In this case, the maximum subset length would be 4, as all elements are divisible by each other. However, if the list includes numbers that cannot all be mutually divisible, such as `nums = [2, 3, 4]`, all of which cannot form a subset where every pair is divisible; the function may incorrectly count these as longer subsets than they should.

Therefore, the function does not handle all cases correctly, particularly edge cases involving numbers that only partially divide each other. Thus, it does not meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
