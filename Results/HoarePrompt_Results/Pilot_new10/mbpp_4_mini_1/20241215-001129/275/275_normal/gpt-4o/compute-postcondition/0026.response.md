In this case:
- `dp[i]` is updated based on its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`.
- Since it is given that `j` is equal to `i`, `dp[j]` would be the same as `dp[i]`.
- The operation effectively means that `dp[i]` will now be the maximum of its current value and `dp[i] + 1`.

Thus, this results in `dp[i]` remaining unchanged because when `j` is `i`, then `dp[j] + 1` is actually `dp[i] + 1`. The value of `dp[i]` cannot increase without further context regarding the values prior to the operation.

Now, taking all this into consideration, only `dp[i]` is affected, but it does not change since `dp[i]` remains the same. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` is updated; `i` must be greater than 1; `j` is `i`; and `dp[i]` is unchanged.**
