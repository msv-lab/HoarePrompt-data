The code updates the `dp` list at index `i` by assigning it the maximum of its current value `dp[i]` and the value at `dp[j] + 1`. The specific values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` depend on what they were before this operation, but since initially `dp` is a list of ones, we know that `dp[i]` starts as 1.

Since `i` must be greater than `j + 1`, we can say that `j` is less than `i - 1`. Therefore, `dp[j]` is also 1 (as all elements in `dp` were initialized to 1).

Thus we compute:

1. Initially, `dp[i]` = 1
2. `dp[j] + 1` = 1 + 1 = 2
3. We then take the maximum: `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` = max(1, 2) = 2

So the updated value of `dp[i]` becomes 2.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, we summarize this in the Output State as follows:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is a list with `dp[i]` updated to 2, and `i` is greater than `j + 1.**
