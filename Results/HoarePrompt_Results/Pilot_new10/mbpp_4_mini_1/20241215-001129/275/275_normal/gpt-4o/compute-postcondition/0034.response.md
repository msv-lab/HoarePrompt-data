To determine the necessary modifications to the state before the next iteration of the loop, we will analyze the information provided:

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `i`, which means it uses all indices from 0 to `i-1`. 
2. The end of the previous iteration indicates that `nums` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, which ensures that there are potential subsequences to evaluate.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have taken values from 0 to `i-1`. If we want to execute the loop another time, `i` must be incremented by 1 since `j` can only take values up to `i-1` (the loop must ensure `j` remains less than `i`).

Given that `dp` is updated based on divisibility conditions tied to the elements in `nums`, if we want to execute the loop again, we also need to consider what `i` has been.

Thus:
- If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, we would increment `i` to `x + 1`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute another time, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least `x + 1` elements to accommodate this increment in `i`.

Considering these points:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least `i + 1` elements, `dp` contains the maximum lengths of divisible subsequences derived from `nums`**.
