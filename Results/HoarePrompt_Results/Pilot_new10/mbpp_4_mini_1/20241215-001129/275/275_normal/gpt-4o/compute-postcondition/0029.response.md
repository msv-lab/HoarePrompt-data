According to the code, the for loop iterates through the indices of the `nums` list. The loop performs its iterations based on the length of `nums`, which is specified by `len(nums)`. Since `nums` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, the loop will iterate through all indices from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached a value of `len(nums) - 1`, which is the last valid index. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to `len(nums)`, which is not a valid index in `nums`, and thus the loop cannot execute again.

To summarize the state changes: 
- The value of `i` must be incremented, but it will exceed the length of the list and therefore cannot lead to another iteration.
- The `nums` remain unchanged, as the loop has completed its iteration through the list.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration (if it were hypothetically possible) would reflect `i` as `len(nums)` without changing the other states.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` contains the maximum length of divisible subsequences derived from `nums`, `i` is `len(nums)`**.
