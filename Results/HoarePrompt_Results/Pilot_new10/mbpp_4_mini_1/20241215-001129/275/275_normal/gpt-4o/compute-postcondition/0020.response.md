`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The original state indicates that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and since `dp` is updated, it implies that `dp[i]` may increase based on the value of `dp[j]`. The preconditions regarding `nums`, `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain valid. Therefore, the output state reflects the potential update to `dp[i]` based on `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` is updated; `i` is at least 1; `j` is 0; `dp[i]` has been updated to be the greater of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.**
