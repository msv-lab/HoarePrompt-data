Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Type**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `n`, which is specified to be a non-negative integer. The problem statement does not mention handling negative integers or other types of input, but since `n` is guaranteed to be non-negative, this is not a concern.

2. **Conversion to String**: The function converts the integer `n` to its string representation using `str(n)`. This allows for iteration over each digit in the integer.

3. **Digit Extraction and Summation**: The program uses a generator expression to iterate through each character (digit) of the string representation of `n`, converts each character back to an integer, and computes the sum of these integer values using the `sum()` function. 

4. **Correctness of Logic**: The sum of the digits is obtained correctly. For example:
    - If `n = 123`, `str(n)` gives `'123'`, and the generator would yield `1`, `2`, and `3`, summing to `6`.
    - If `n = 0`, it correctly handles the case by returning `0`.

Since the program reliably produces the sum of the digits for any non-negative integer input (which is aligned with the problem description), it is deemed correct in fulfilling the requirements stated.

Thus, the correctness conclusion is appropriately assessed as **True**.
