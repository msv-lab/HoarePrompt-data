Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Validation**: The comment preceding the function states that "n is a non-negative integer." This condition is satisfied as per the problem description.
2. **Sum of Digits Calculation**: The function converts the non-negative integer `n` to a string and iterates through each character (which represents a digit). It then converts each character back to an integer and computes the sum of those integers using the built-in `sum()` function.
3. **Function Behavior**: The function is explicitly designed to return the sum of the digits for any non-negative integer input, which aligns perfectly with the problem statement.

To illustrate with an example:
- For an input of `123`, the function would convert it to its string representation, extract the digits `1`, `2`, and `3`, convert them back to integers, and compute the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).

There are no potential cases or inputs for which this function would fail to compute the sum of digits for a non-negative integer, thereby making it correct according to the problem description. Thus, the output is correctly defined as **True**.
