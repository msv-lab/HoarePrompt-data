Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` accurately computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It converts the integer to a string, iterates through each character (digit), converts them back to integers, and sums them up. 

The problem description requires the function to handle non-negative integers, and the output hints confirm that the function performs correctly for all non-negative integer inputs. There are no edge cases or potential inputs not accounted for in the problem description, as negative integers are explicitly excluded. 

Therefore, the function meets the requirements stated in the problem description for every potential case.
