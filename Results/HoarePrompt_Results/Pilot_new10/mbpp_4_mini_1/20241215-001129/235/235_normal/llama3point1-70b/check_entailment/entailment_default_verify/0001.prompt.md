You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly sums the digits of a non-negative integer. It accomplishes this by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character in the string (which represents a digit), converting each character back to an integer, and then summing these integer values. 

Hereâ€™s a brief analysis of potential edge cases:

1. **Input Zero**: For the input `0`, the function returns `0`, which is correct since the sum of the digits of `0` is indeed `0`.
2. **Positive Integers**: For inputs like `123`, the function returns `6`, which correctly represents the sum of `1 + 2 + 3`.
3. **Larger Numbers**: For `9999`, it returns `36`, which is also correct since `9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36`.
4. **Leading Zeros**: Since the input is an integer, there are no leading zeros to worry about in the input.

All tested cases align with the problem requirements, meaning the program behaves correctly for all valid non-negative integer inputs described in the problem statement. As no case breaks the expected behavior, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It accurately computes this sum for any non-negative integer input. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
