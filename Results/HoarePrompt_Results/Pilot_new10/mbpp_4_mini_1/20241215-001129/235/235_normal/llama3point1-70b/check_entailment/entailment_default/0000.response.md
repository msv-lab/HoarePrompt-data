Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It uses a generator expression to iterate through each digit of the integer (converted to a string), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. The output hints confirm that the function accurately computes the sum for any non-negative integer input, ensuring that it works for all potential cases, including edge cases like 0 and other small non-negative integers. Therefore, the code meets all requirements of the problem description.
