Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description by correctly calculating the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here is a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The function is designed to accept non-negative integers, as stated in the problem description. The assertion tests provided serve as examples of valid inputs within this range.

2. **Logic of the Function**:
   - The function initializes a variable `total` to hold the sum of the digits.
   - A while loop continues to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop, the last digit of `n` is obtained using `n % 10` and added to `total`.
   - The variable `n` is then reduced by removing the last digit using integer division (`n //= 10`).
   - This process continues until `n` is reduced to 0.

3. **Correct Handling of Different Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the initial value of `total`, which is 0, is returned. This is consistent with the requirement that the sum of the digits in 0 is 0.
   - For positive integers, the function accurately sums up each digit as it iterates through all the digits of `n`.

4. **Assertions**: The provided test cases confirm the correctness of the function. 
   - The assertion `func_1(345)` correctly returns 12 (3 + 4 + 5).
   - The assertion `func_1(12)` correctly returns 3 (1 + 2).
   - The assertion `func_1(97)` correctly returns 16 (9 + 7).

No scenarios have been identified where the function would fail or return an incorrect result for the specified problem description. Therefore, the implementation can be deemed correct in all outlined cases.
