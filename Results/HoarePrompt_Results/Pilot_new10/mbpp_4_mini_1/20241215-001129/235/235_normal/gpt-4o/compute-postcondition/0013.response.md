Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0, and if `n` is positive, it calculates the sum of all its digits by repeatedly extracting the last digit of `n` until `n` becomes 0. There are no error conditions or exceptions handled in the function. **
