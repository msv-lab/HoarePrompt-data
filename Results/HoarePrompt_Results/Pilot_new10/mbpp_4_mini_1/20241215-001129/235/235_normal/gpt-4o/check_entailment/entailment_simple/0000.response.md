Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function `func_1` that computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. 

Here's why it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. **Handling Non-Negative Integers**: The problem specifies that the input is a non-negative integer. The function `func_1` correctly processes this by initializing a total sum variable (`total`) to zero and iterating over its digits while `n` is greater than 0.

2. **Sum of Digits**: Inside the loop, the program extracts the last digit of `n` using `n % 10` and adds it to `total`. This operation correctly accumulates the sum of all digits as intended.

3. **Reducing `n`**: After processing the last digit, `n` is updated using integer division `n //= 10`, which effectively removes the last digit from `n`. The loop continues until all digits have been processed (i.e., until `n` becomes 0).

4. **Handling Input `0`**: If `n` starts as `0`, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains `0`, which is the correct result, as the sum of the digits of `0` is indeed `0`.

5. **Examples Given**: The assertions provided in the annotation correctly demonstrate that the function returns the expected results for various non-negative integers, thus validating its correctness in practice: 
   - `func_1(345)` returns `12` (3 + 4 + 5)
   - `func_1(12)` returns `3` (1 + 2)
   - `func_1(97)` returns `16` (9 + 7)

Since the program handles all relevant cases correctly and adheres to the problem requirements, the correctness of the program is affirmed as true.
