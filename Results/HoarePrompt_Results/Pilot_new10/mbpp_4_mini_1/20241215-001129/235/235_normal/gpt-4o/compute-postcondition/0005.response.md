The variable `total` is incremented by the last digit of the previous value of `n`, which is `n % 10`. Since `n` is changed to its integer division by 10 (`n // 10`), the new values will reflect these updates. The previous value of `total` will be increase by the value of `n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is increased by the last digit of the previous value of `n`, and `n` is the integer division of its previous value by 10.**
