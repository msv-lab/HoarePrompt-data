You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the number `n`, adding each digit (obtained by `n % 10`) to a running total, and then removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`). 

The assertions provided in the code demonstrate that the function works correctly for the specified test cases, which cover various examples of non-negative integers. Additionally, the code handles potential edge cases such as when `n` is 0 (the sum of the digits is 0).

Since no cases arise where the function fails to meet the stated requirement as per the problem description, the program is correct for all potential inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the implementation is valid.

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `total` is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`. If the original `n` was non-negative (including 0), the loop will execute only if `n` was greater than 0 to contribute to `total`. If `n` was initially 0, `total` remains 0.
    return total
    #The program returns total which is the sum of all digits of the original value of n, and since n is 0, total remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0, and if `n` is positive, it calculates the sum of all its digits by repeatedly extracting the last digit of `n` until `n` becomes 0. There are no error conditions or exceptions handled in the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
