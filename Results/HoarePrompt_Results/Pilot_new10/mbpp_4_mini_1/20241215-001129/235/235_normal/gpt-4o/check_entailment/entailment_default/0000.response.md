Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function behaves correctly according to the problem description and the examples provided. It accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. The logic implemented in the function uses a while loop to extract each digit of `n` by taking `n % 10` and adding it to `total`. It then reduces `n` by dividing it by 10 using integer division (`n //= 10`). The process continues until `n` becomes 0. There are no errors or exceptions thrown for non-negative integers, and the existing tests provided (e.g., `func_1(345)`, `func_1(12)`, and `func_1(97)`) demonstrate that the function returns the expected results. Importantly, the function also correctly handles the case when `n` is 0, returning 0 as expected. Thus, it meets the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
