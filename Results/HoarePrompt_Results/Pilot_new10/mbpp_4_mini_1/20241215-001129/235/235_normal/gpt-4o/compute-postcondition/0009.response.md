The value of `n` is updated by performing an integer division by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. While `total` has already been increased by the last digit of `n`, its previous value remains unchanged. The value of `total` is still valid after the operation, as it was incremented by `n % 10` before `n` is modified. Since `n` must have been at least 10 before this operation, its new value will be at least 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `total` is equal to the previous value of `total` plus `n % 10, and `n` is now `n // 10`.**
