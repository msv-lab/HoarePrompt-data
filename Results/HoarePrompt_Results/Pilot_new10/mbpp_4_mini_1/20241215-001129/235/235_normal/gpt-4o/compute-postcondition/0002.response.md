The value of `total` is incremented by the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. Given that `n` must be greater than 0, `n % 10` will yield a value between 1 and 9. The initial value of `total` is 0, so after this operation, `total` will have the value equal to `n % 10`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to `n % 10`**.
