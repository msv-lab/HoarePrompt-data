The implementation of `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer by iteratively extracting and summing the last digit. It also rightly returns 0 for the input 0, which aligns with the problem description that requires handling non-negative integers.

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, and given the provided output hints confirm that the function correctly handles the entire range of valid non-negative integers (including 0), the assessment seems to match the functionality of the code.

Since the code does not handle negative integers or any cases outside non-negative integers, but the problem specifically states that the input will be a non-negative integer, I find that this does not contradict the problem statement.

Therefore, my conclusion aligns with the original assessment: the program functions as intended for all acceptable cases as per the problem description.

Final: **True**
