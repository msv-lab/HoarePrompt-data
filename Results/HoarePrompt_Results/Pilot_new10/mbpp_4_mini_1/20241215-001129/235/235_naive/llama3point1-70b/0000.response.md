Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string to iterate over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and then sums them. It will handle all non-negative integers, including 0 (which will return 0 as the sum) and any positive integers. As every potential case for non-negative integers has been considered, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description accurately.
