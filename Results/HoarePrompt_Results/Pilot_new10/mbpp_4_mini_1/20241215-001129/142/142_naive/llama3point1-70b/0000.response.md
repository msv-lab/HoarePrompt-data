Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(lst, element)` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. It uses the `all()` function in conjunction with a generator expression that iterates through each item in the list. 

1. If the list is empty, `all()` will return `True`, which is consistent with the expectation that all (zero) items can be considered equal to the element.
2. If the list contains one item, it will return `True` if that item equals the element and `False` otherwise.
3. If the list contains multiple items, it checks each one, returning `False` as soon as it finds an item that does not equal the given element.

There are no scenarios in which the provided function would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
