Final: **True**

The original assessment claimed that the program does not handle the case where the input list is empty and, therefore, fails to satisfy the problem description for all potential cases. However, the function does indeed return `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the common interpretation that "all items are equal" because there are no items to contradict this claim. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that for an empty list, the function will return `True`, as there are no items to contradict the condition.

As such, the original assessment that the program's correctness is **False** is not accurate. The program behaves correctly according to the problem description and the logic delineated in the output hints. Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct.
