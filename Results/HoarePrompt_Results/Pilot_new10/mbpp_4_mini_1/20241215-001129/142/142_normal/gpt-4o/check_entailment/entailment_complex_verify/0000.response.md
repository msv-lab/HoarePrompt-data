The original assessment stated the correctness of the function `func_1` as **True**. The assessment emphasized that the function correctly checks whether all items in a list are equal to a specified element, returning `False` immediately upon finding any mismatch and returning `True` only if all items match. The test cases provided also align perfectly with this description.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it confirms that the function loops through the list and checks each element against the provided element. The state description in the annotations, particularly that the function will return `True` if all items are equal or it will return `False` if any item does not match, aligns with both the logic implemented in the function and the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

Moreover, the annotation also notes that if the list is empty, the default behavior of returning `True` is in line with the stipulated logic, as there are no items to contradict the condition.

Thus, given that all elements align with the original assessment's conclusions about the function's behavior according to the problem description, we can conclude that the original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
