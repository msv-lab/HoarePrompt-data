According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `lst`. If the list has more items than have already been iterated over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the list and is equal to `element`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least another item in the list after the first item. Therefore, if `item` is the first item in `lst`, after this iteration the next value of `item` will be the second item in `lst`, and the list must contain at least 2 items.

State: **`lst` is a list of items that has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `lst`, and `item` is equal to `element`**
