Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here is an explanation of why it fulfills the task of checking if all items in a list are equal to a given element:

1. **Function Signature and Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of items, and `element`, which is the value to be checked against the items in the list.

2. **Iteration through the List**: The function iterates through each item in the list `lst`. If any item does not equal `element`, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all items match.

3. **Return True for All Matching Items**: If the loop completes without finding any unequal items, the function returns `True`, confirming that all items in the list are indeed equal to `element`.

4. **Behavior with Empty Lists**: The function returns `True` for an empty list. This is correct as per the problem description, since with no items present, there are also no items to contradict the condition of equality.

5. **Test Cases Validation**: The assertions in the annotated program verify the functionality:
   - `func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue')` returns `False` (not all items match).
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7)` returns `False` (none of the items match).
   - `func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green')` returns `True` (all items match).

Overall, the implementation correctly adheres to the problem's requirements for all potential cases, including handling of empty lists, thus it is confirmed as correct.
