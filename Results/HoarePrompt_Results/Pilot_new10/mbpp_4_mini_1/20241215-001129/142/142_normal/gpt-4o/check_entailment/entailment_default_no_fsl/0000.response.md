Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, according to the problem description, if the input list is empty, the expected return value should be `True` because there are no items to contradict the condition that all items must equal the given element. However, the current implementation of the function does not explicitly handle the empty list case, and thus, will incorrectly return `True` when there are no elements to check. 

For example, if we test the function with an empty list:

```python
assert func_1([], 'blue') == True  # Expected output
```

This test will pass in the current implementation because the function will simply return `True` when no contradictions are found. However, we cannot be sure of this behavior for any other cases, especially if the logical flow does not handle the empty list explicitly.

Additionally, the provided output hints state that the function returns `True` for an empty list but fail to outline that the interpretation of this return must also be explicitly described in the function to adhere strictly to the requirements stated in the problem description.

Thus, since the function's behavior for at least one potential input (empty list) is not clear and directly aligns with the problem description, the correctness of the implementation cannot be confirmed in all cases.
