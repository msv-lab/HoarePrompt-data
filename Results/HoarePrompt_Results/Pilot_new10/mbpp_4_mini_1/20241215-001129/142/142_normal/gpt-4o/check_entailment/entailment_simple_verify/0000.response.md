Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check whether all items in the provided list are equal to the specified element. The annotated version of the code confirms that when executing the function, it correctly identifies that if any item differs from the given element, it returns `False`. If all items are equal, it returns `True`. 

The provided assertions also validate that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program aligns with the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is indeed correct.
