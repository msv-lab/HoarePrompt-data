Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate because the program correctly implements the specified functionality according to the problem description. The function `func_1(lst, element)` correctly checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element, returning `True` for an empty list (which is appropriate since vacuously, all (zero) elements are equal to any element), `True` if a single element equals the input element, and `False` if any item in a multi-item list does not equal the element. The analysis of the logic in the original assessment aligns well with the expected outputs and behavior described in the output hints. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement without any inaccuracies in its implementation.
