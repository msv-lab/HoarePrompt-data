Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `all()` function to check if all items in the input list `lst` are equal to the specified `element`. The behavior also includes handling edge cases gracefully, such as returning `True` for an empty list (since there are no items that are not equal to `element`). Thus, the code correctly checks for equality under all potential scenarios as outlined in the problem description.
