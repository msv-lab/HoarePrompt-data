Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst, element)` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the `element`. It uses the `all()` function in combination with a generator expression that iterates through each item in `lst` and checks if it equals `element`. 

The output hints state that the function returns True for an empty list since vacuously all elements (none in this case) can be considered equal to any given element. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

The function handles:
- Non-empty lists where all elements are equal to the provided `element`.
- Non-empty lists where at least one element differs from `element`.
- An empty list where the function correctly returns True.

Since the function behaves correctly across all described cases, including edge cases such as an empty list, it fulfills the requirements set out in the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the program is confirmed as True.
