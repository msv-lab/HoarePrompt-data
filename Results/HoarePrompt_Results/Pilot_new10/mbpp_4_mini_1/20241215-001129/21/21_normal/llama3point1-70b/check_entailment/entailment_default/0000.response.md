Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code uses the `min` function to return the smallest number from the list `nums`. While this correctly identifies the minimum value in a non-empty list, it fails to handle the case of an empty list, which will raise a `ValueError`. The problem description requires that the function should be able to find the smallest number in a list for every potential case, including when the list is empty. Therefore, since the program does not account for this edge case, it is incorrect.
