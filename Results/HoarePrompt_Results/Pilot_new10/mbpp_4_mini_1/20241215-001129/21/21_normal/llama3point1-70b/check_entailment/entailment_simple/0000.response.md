Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input (`nums`) and returns the smallest number in that list using the built-in `min()` function. 

The `min()` function is designed to return the smallest item from an iterable (like a list), and since the problem description specifies that the function must find the smallest number in a list, using `min(nums)` fulfills that requirement perfectly. 

The only prerequisite for this function to work correctly is that the input should be a non-empty list of numbers. If the list is empty, the `min()` function would raise a `ValueError`, but the problem description does not specify handling for empty lists. Therefore, under the assumption that the function will be called with a valid (non-empty) list of numbers, the implementation is correct.

In summary, the program meets the requirement as it accurately finds and returns the smallest number in the provided list of numbers.
