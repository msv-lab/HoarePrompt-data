Final: **False**

The original assessment was incorrect because it stated that the implementation handles all cases appropriately, but the annotated version of the code clarifies that the function does not handle the edge case of an empty list. The `min()` function raises a `ValueError` when given an empty sequence, indicating that the program could fail if such input is provided. Since the problem description does not specify handling for an empty list, and the function will raise an exception if it encounters one, this leads to the conclusion that the provided implementation is not entirely correct without additional error handling. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is that it is false.
