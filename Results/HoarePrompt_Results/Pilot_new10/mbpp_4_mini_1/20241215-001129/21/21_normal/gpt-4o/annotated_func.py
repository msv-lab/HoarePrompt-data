#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of numbers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'lst' which contains numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` containing numbers and returns the minimum value from that list. However, if the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` since the `min()` function cannot operate on an empty sequence. Therefore, the function does not handle the edge case of an empty list appropriately, leading to an uncaught exception.
