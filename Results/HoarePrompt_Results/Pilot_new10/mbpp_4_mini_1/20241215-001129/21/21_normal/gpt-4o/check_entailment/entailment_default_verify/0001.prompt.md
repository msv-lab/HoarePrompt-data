You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. The assertions provided as test cases cover various scenarios:

1. Finding the smallest number in a list with mixed values: `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is correct.
2. Finding the smallest number in a list of sequential integers: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`, which is correct.
3. Finding the smallest number in a list of larger numbers: `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`, which is also correct.

Additionally, the `min()` function handles edge cases, including:

- An empty list (though it will raise a `ValueError`, which is an out-of-scope case as per the problem description).
- Lists containing negative numbers.
- Lists with duplicate smallest numbers.

Since all provided test cases are valid and return correct results as per the problem description, the program is deemed correct. Thus, there are no found cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Overall, the program accurately meets the requirement of finding the smallest number in a list under the assertion conditions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `lst` containing numbers and returns the minimum value from that list. However, if the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` since the `min()` function cannot operate on an empty sequence. Therefore, the function does not handle the edge case of an empty list appropriately, leading to an uncaught exception. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
