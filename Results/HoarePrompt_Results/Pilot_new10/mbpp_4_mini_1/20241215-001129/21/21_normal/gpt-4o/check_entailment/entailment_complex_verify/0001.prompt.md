You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. The assertions provided as test cases cover various scenarios:

1. Finding the smallest number in a list with mixed values: `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is correct.
2. Finding the smallest number in a list of sequential integers: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`, which is correct.
3. Finding the smallest number in a list of larger numbers: `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`, which is also correct.

Additionally, the `min()` function handles edge cases, including:

- An empty list (though it will raise a `ValueError`, which is an out-of-scope case as per the problem description).
- Lists containing negative numbers.
- Lists with duplicate smallest numbers.

Since all provided test cases are valid and return correct results as per the problem description, the program is deemed correct. Thus, there are no found cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Overall, the program accurately meets the requirement of finding the smallest number in a list under the assertion conditions.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of numbers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'lst' which contains numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` containing numbers and returns the minimum value from that list. However, if the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError` since the `min()` function cannot operate on an empty sequence. Therefore, the function does not handle the edge case of an empty list appropriately, leading to an uncaught exception.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
