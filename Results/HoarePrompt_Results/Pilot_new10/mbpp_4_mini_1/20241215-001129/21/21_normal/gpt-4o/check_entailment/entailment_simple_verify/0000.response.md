Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number in a non-empty list by using the `min` function, which is designed to return the minimum value from an iterable. The provided assertions confirm that it behaves as expected for the given test cases. Additionally, the assumption that the input will be valid aligns with the stated conditions; thus, the potential issue with an empty list does not affect the correctness of the function as per the given requirements. Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and handles the defined inputs correctly.
