Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number in a list by using the built-in `min` function. The assertions provided in the test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. Additionally, the `min` function handles various lists, including those with only positive numbers, and returns the smallest value.

The only scenario that would lead to an issue is when the input list is empty. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list. Given that the function does work correctly for the defined cases, and I can't find a case where it fails based on the provided information, I conclude that the implementation aligns with the problem description.
