Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list `nums` is empty. Calling `min()` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError`. According to the problem description, the function should find the smallest number in a list, and an empty input doesn't satisfy the requirement. Therefore, there are potential scenarios where the program fails to work correctly.
