Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. The assertions provided as test cases cover various scenarios:

1. Finding the smallest number in a list with mixed values: `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is correct.
2. Finding the smallest number in a list of sequential integers: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `1`, which is correct.
3. Finding the smallest number in a list of larger numbers: `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` returns `45`, which is also correct.

Additionally, the `min()` function handles edge cases, including:

- An empty list (though it will raise a `ValueError`, which is an out-of-scope case as per the problem description).
- Lists containing negative numbers.
- Lists with duplicate smallest numbers.

Since all provided test cases are valid and return correct results as per the problem description, the program is deemed correct. Thus, there are no found cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Overall, the program accurately meets the requirement of finding the smallest number in a list under the assertion conditions.
