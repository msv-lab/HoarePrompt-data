Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not handle the case when the input strings are empty. If the tuple contains an empty string, the program will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the last character (`s[-1]`). For example, if the input is `func_1(('', 'abc', 'def'))`, it will result in an error since the first string is empty and does not have a last character. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
