Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string. 

The assertions included in the program demonstrate that it works correctly for multiple test cases:
- For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the function returns `['s', 'r', 's']`, which is expected.
- For the input `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, it returns `['e', 'r', 'e']`, also as expected.
- For the input `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, it returns `['a', 't', 'o']`, which matches the expected output.

The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extract the last character using indexing (`s[-1]`), which is valid for non-empty strings.

To validate correctness, consider edge cases:
1. If the input tuple contains an empty string (e.g., `('', 'test')`), the function will generate an `IndexError` because it will attempt to access the last character of an empty string.
2. If the input is an empty tuple (e.g., `()`) the function will return an empty list, which is acceptable.

Since the function does not handle the case of empty strings and could raise an error, it fails to fulfill the requirement over all potential inputs.

Thus, there exists a scenario (an empty string in the tuple) where the function does not work as expected. Hence:

Correctness: **False**
