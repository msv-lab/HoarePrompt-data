The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the input strings are empty, leading to an `IndexError`. The annotated version of the code confirms this reasoning by indicating that if any string in the tuple is empty, an error will occur due to attempting to access an index that does not exist.

Given the problem description, the program needs to extract the last character of each string in the input tuple. While the program functions properly for valid (non-empty) strings, it fails to fulfill the requirements for all potential cases, including cases where strings may be empty.

Since the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., no empty strings) does not hold as a guarantee, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.

Thus, based on the continued concern around empty string handling and the potential for an `IndexError`, the final assessment is:

Final: **False**.
