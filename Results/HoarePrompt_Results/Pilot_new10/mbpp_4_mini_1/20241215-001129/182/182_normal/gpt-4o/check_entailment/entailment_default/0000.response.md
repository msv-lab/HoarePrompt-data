Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to extract and return the last character of each string from a tuple. The output hints indicate that if any string in the tuple is empty, an error will occur due to attempting to access an index that does not exist. This is a crucial edge case that the code does not account for. For instance, if the input is `func_1(('', 'for', 'Vers'))`, this will lead to an `IndexError` because the first string is empty. Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
