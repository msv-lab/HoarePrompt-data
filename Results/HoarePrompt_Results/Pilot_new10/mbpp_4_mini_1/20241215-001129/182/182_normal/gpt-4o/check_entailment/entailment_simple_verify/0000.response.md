Final: **False**

The original assessment was based on the assumption that the function `func_1` could potentially raise an `IndexError` when it encounters empty strings. However, the annotations clarify that the function is explicitly designed to work on a tuple of strings and assumes valid input, as outlined in the problem description. Since we are assuming valid input (i.e., inputs will not contain empty strings), the function will always correctly return the last character of each non-empty string in the input tuple without raising an error. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is not accurate, and the function behaves as expected under the assumption provided.
