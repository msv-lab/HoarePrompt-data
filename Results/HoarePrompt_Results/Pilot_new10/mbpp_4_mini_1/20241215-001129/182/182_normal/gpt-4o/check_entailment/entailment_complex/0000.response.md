Correctness: **False**

The program is not correct because it does not handle the case where one or more strings in the tuple may be empty. According to the problem description, the function is expected to extract the rear index element (last character) of each string in the tuple, but if an empty string is passed to the function, it will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access the last character (index `-1`). 

This is a critical issue because the function's behavior does not meet the expectation that for any input, it should return the last character or handle cases where strings might be empty gracefully. Therefore, the function fails to fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case.
