The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **True**, but upon further inspection, the reasoning must be re-evaluated in light of the specifications and output hints.

The problem description specifies that the function should extract the last character from each string in a given tuple. While the function implementation does correctly perform this task for non-empty strings, it does not handle the case of empty strings correctly, which has been indicated in both the original assessment and the output hints. Specifically, if an empty string is encountered, the function will raise an `IndexError`, thereby failing the requirements of the problem.

The output hints clearly state that an error will occur if any string in the tuple is empty, which aligns with the concerns raised in the original assessment about error handling and the overall correctness of the function when provided with various potential inputs (including edge cases).

Based on this analysis, the original assessment was inaccurate. The function does not cover all possible valid input cases as per the specifications, and thus it cannot be deemed correct.

Final: **False**
