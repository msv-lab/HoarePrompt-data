You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string. 

The assertions included in the program demonstrate that it works correctly for multiple test cases:
- For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the function returns `['s', 'r', 's']`, which is expected.
- For the input `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, it returns `['e', 'r', 'e']`, also as expected.
- For the input `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, it returns `['a', 't', 'o']`, which matches the expected output.

The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extract the last character using indexing (`s[-1]`), which is valid for non-empty strings.

To validate correctness, consider edge cases:
1. If the input tuple contains an empty string (e.g., `('', 'test')`), the function will generate an `IndexError` because it will attempt to access the last character of an empty string.
2. If the input is an empty tuple (e.g., `()`) the function will return an empty list, which is acceptable.

Since the function does not handle the case of empty strings and could raise an error, it fails to fulfill the requirement over all potential inputs.

Thus, there exists a scenario (an empty string in the tuple) where the function does not work as expected. Hence:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, an error will occur due to attempting to access an index that does not exist. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all strings in the tuple are non-empty to avoid an IndexError. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
