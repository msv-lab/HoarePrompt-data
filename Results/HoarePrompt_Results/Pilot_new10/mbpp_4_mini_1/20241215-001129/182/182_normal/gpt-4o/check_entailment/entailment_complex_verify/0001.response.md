The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **True** because it was correctly returning the last character of each string in the provided test cases. However, the assessment failed to consider edge cases, particularly where the inputs could include empty strings, which would lead to an `IndexError`.

The annotated version of the code highlights that if any string in the tuple is empty, an error will occur when attempting to access a non-existent index. This acknowledgment of potential errors aligns with the reasoning from the original assessment in recognizing that the function does not handle cases involving empty strings.

Given that the original assessment identified the situation correctly but concluded that the function was still correct overall, I must assert that the original assessment does indeed lack consideration for valid edge cases concerning input.

Therefore, after analyzing both the initial assessment and the provided annotations, it is clear that the program is not robust enough to be considered correct due to this oversight.

Final: **False**
