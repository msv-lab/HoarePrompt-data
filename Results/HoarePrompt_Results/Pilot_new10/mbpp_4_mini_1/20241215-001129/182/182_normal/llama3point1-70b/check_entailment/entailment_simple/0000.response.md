Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The task is to extract only the last character (rear index element) of each string in a given tuple. 

Here's how the program fulfills this requirement:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a single argument, `strings`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings.
2. It uses a list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]`, which iterates over each string `s` in the `strings` tuple.
3. For each string `s`, it retrieves the last character using the indexing method `s[-1]`. This correctly extracts the rear index element of the string.
4. The result is returned as a list containing the last characters of all the strings in the tuple.

The program will work correctly for any tuple of strings provided that:
- Each string in the tuple is non-empty (as accessing `s[-1]` on an empty string would raise an IndexError).
- The overall structure aligns with the described functionality.

Since the program aims to extract the last characters of each string as specified, it will always perform as required when given valid input, thus adhering to the problem description.
