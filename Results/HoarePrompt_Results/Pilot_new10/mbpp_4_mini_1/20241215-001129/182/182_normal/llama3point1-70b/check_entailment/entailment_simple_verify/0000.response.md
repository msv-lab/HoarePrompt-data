Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate as the program successfully extracts the last character of each string in the provided tuple, as per the problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms that the input is indeed a tuple of strings and that it returns a list of the last characters correctly. Since we assume valid inputs and the function handles non-empty strings, the output meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
