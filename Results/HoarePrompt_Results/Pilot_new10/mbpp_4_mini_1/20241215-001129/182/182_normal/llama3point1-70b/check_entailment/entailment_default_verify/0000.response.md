The original assessment claims that the program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the provided tuple. However, the output hints indicate that if any string in the tuple is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError` when it attempts to access the last character of that empty string.

Since the problem description requires the function to extract the last character from each string in the tuple, the presence of an empty string would lead to an error in execution, which is a violation of the problem's expectations. Consequently, the assessment that the program is correct is not accurate.

Final: **False**
