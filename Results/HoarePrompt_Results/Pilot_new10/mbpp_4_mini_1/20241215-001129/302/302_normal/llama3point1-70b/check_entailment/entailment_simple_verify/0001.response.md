The original assessment concluded that the program is **False** based on the assertion that the function does not fully take advantage of the sorted nature of the input array, and that it fails to handle some edge cases adequately. However, the annotated version of the program provides evidence that the function correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of a specified number or returns `-1` when not found, all within the context of valid inputs (including empty arrays).

Given the clarification that valid input is always received, the program behaves correctly according to the problem description. The issues raised in the original assessment concerning optimization and performance do not affect the logical correctness that the function is designed to achieve.

Therefore, after considering the problem description, the function's behavior, and the annotated states, I believe the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
