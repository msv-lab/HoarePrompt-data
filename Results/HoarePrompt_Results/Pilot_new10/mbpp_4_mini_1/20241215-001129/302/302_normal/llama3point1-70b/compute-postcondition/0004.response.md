According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `arr`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `arr` has at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `arr`, which is not equal to `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `arr` must contain at least 2 elements.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`.**
