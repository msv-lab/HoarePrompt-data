You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a logical flaw when handling cases where the `num` is not present in the input `arr`. Specifically, since the problem description states it should find the first occurrence of a given number in a **sorted** array, the code should account for the possible presence of duplicates and return the index of the first occurrence.

Here's a key case where the program does not return the correct index:
- For a sorted array `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 2`, the expected output is `1` (the index of the first occurrence of `2`). 
- The program correctly finds `2` at index `1` and returns `1`.

However, consider the case:
- For a sorted array `arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 1`, the expected output is `0`, but the program will return `0` correctly as per the current implementation and works as intended.

Yet, if we instead consider an array with no repeating elements like `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` for `num = 5`, the result is `-1`, which is also the expected behavior since `5` is not in the list.

The code works fine in the example tested, however, on observing multiple possibilities like when multiple occurrences but it returns the first index which is correct according to the description. 

Therefore, there is no evident bug when assessing multiple cases including duplicates or absence in such sorted array context. The program should cover all potential scenarios based upon the algorithmâ€™s linear search through sorted elements.

Hence, given my elaborated exploration and no visible flaws despite covered cases, and how the function operates as intended without implicit issues further abstracted, therefore the decision determines:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array across various test scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` if found; otherwise, it returns -1 if `num` is not present in the list. There are no checks for duplicate values, so if there are multiple occurrences of `num`, it always returns the index of the first one. If the list is empty, the function will return -1. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
