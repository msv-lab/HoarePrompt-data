The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False**, primarily citing a logical flaw in how it handles the case of finding the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array, particularly in the presence of duplicates. However, the analysis and examples provided—including the test cases where the program correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence, such as `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` returning index `1` for `num = 2` and `arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` returning index `0` for `num = 1`—demonstrate that the program behaves correctly in these scenarios and adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description.

Moreover, according to the annotations, the program handles the search correctly and returns `-1` when the element is not found, which is consistent with the expected behavior described.

Based on the detailed analysis and the logic established in the annotated version, it appears that the original assessment misinterpreted the function’s handling of duplicate values. The program effectively returns the index of the first occurrence, even in the presence of duplicates, thus aligning with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment was inaccurate, and the function is indeed correct.

Final: **True**.
