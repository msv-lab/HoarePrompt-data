The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, and `target` is an integer. After executing the function body, if `target` exists in `arr`, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `target`. If `target` does not exist in `arr`, the function returns -1 along with the position in `arr` where `target` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `target` if found, or -1 along with the insertion position if not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `target` if it exists; otherwise, it returns -1 and the insertion position of `target` in `arr` to maintain sorted order.**
