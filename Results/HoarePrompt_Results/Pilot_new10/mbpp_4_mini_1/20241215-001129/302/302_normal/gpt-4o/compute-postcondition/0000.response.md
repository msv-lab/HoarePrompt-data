The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list of integers in sorted order and `target` is an integer. 

The line of code initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`. The initial values for `low` and `high` will depend on the length of the `arr`.

If `arr` is an empty list, `high` would be -1. If `arr` contains one integer, `high` would be 0. 

However, since the task does not specify the array and its length, the specific values of `low` and `high` cannot be determined. 

- Therefore, we can summarize that `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, reflecting the unchanged properties of `arr` and `target`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.**
