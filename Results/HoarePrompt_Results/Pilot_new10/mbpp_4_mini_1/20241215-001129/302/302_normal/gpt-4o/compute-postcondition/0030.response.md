Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `result` is the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists in `arr`; otherwise, `result` remains -1. If `target` is not found, `low` is equal to the position in `arr` where `target` would be if it were inserted while maintaining sorted order.**
