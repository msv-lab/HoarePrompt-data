Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, and `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, then `result` is equal to `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is reset to `mid - 1`, maintaining that `low` remains less than or equal to `high`.***
