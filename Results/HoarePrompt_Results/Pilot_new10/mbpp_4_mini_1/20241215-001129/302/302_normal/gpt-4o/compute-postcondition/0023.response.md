The variable `mid` is assigned the result of the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. Since `low` remains less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be a valid index within the bounds of the `arr` list. The values of `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` remains less than or equal to `high, mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
