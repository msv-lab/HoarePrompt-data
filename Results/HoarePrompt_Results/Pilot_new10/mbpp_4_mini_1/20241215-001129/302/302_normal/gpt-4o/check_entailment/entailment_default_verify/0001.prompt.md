You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, I need to analyze the functionality of the `func_1` function as it relates to the problem description: finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to the last index of the array.
   - `result` is initially set to `-1`, which indicates that the number has not yet been found.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The function uses a while loop to perform binary search as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - It calculates the middle index `mid` using `(low + high) // 2`.
   - If the element at index `mid` equals the target, it updates `result` with `mid`, then continues to search to the left by setting `high` to `mid - 1`. This is the critical step that ensures it finds the first occurrence of the target.
   - If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it modifies `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the upper half.
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it modifies `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the `result`, which is either the index of the first occurrence of the target or `-1` if the target is not found.

### Test Cases Evaluation

The provided assertions test the function with the following conditions:
- The first occurrence of `5` in `[2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` is at index `1`, which is correct.
- The first occurrence of `5` in `[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` is at index `2`, which is also correct.
- The first occurrence of `6` in `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` is at index `4`, which again is correct.

### Edge Cases

To further verify the correctness, I can think of other edge cases:
1. **Empty Array**: `func_1([], 5)` should return `-1` since the array is empty.
2. **Number Not Present**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)` should return `-1` since `6` is not in the array.
3. **First Element Target**: `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1, 2], 1)` should return `0` as the first occurrence of `1` is at index `0`.
4. **Last Element Target**: `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1, 2], 2)` should return `4` as the first occurrence of `2` is at index `4`.

### Conclusion

The provided function handles these cases correctly and follows the problem statement entirely. Therefore, as I cannot find any examples where the function fails to do what is described, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array according to the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a sorted list of integers, `arr`, and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find and return the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` does not exist in the list, the function returns -1. Additionally, the position where `target` could be inserted to maintain sorted order corresponds to the value of `low` at the end of the search, but this position is not directly returned. Therefore, if `target` is not in the list, the function does not indicate the insertion point and simply returns -1. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
