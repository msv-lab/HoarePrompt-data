Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Handling of Duplicates**: The program adjusts the search range (using `high = mid - 1`) when it finds the target value, ensuring that it continues searching towards the left side of the array. This guarantees that the first occurrence (if any) of the target will be found.

2. **Return Value**: If the target is present in the array, the function returns the index of its first occurrence. If the target is not found, it correctly returns -1, following the problem description.

3. **Sorted Array**: The binary search algorithm is applicable to sorted arrays, and the given function respects this requirement.

4. **Insertion Point**: The output hints correctly describe that while the function does not explicitly return the insertion point, it indicates where the target could be inserted by the final value of the `low` variable when the target is not present.

5. **Examples Validated**: All the provided assertions in the provided code successfully validate the correctness of the function against known cases.

Therefore, the function implements the required logic accurately for all potential cases given in the problem description.
