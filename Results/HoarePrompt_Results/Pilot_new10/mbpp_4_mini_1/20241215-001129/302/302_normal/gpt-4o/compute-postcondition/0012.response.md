Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order and `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1` and `high` remains `len(arr) - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `low` remains 0. In both cases, `result` remains -1, and `mid` is recalculated as `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`.***
