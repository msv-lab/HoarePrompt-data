The `low` variable is updated to be `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, the value of `low` changes to a new value, which is one greater than the previous value of `mid`. This does not affect the other variables, and they retain their original values.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is equal to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1`, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is equal to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is less than `target`.**
