The original assessment accurately identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The details in the assessment correctly outline how the binary search algorithm is implemented to achieve this. Furthermore, the original assessment highlights a potential flaw regarding handling an empty array input, but it also emphasizes that the function behaves correctly for valid inputs. 

The output hints reinforce the focus on the binary search for the first occurrence of the target and clarify the function's expected behavior. Since one of the output hints explicitly states that the function returns -1 if the target does not exist in the list, it indicates that while it doesn't provide additional information about the potential insertion point, it still provides a correct output under the conditions described.

Thus, given the understanding that the input will always be valid and in accordance with the problem description, and recognizing that the function behaves correctly for valid inputs, we stick with the original assessment.

Final: **True**.
