The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` has not been specified but is determined by the formula `(low + high) // 2`, so `high` is now one less than the current value of `mid`. The values of `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `result` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` remains less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `result` equals `mid`, `high` equals `mid - 1`.**
