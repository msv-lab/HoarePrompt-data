Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if not found; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if not found; both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not equal to -1, and the current value of `first_occurrence` is equal to the current value of `last_occurrence`, indicating that `char` appears only once in `s`.***
