To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's examine the requirements specified in the problem description and the functionality of the code.

### Problem Description
The task is to implement a Python function that removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Annotated Program Analysis
1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The program uses `s.find(char)` to get the index of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.
   - It uses `s.rfind(char)` to get the index of the last occurrence of `char`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The program first checks if both occurrences are found (`first_occurrence != -1` and `last_occurrence != -1`).
   - If they are equal, it means `char` appears only once in `s`, and it removes it using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, which is correct.
   - If they are not equal, it constructs a new string by removing the first occurrence and then the last occurrence correctly. This part of the logic is also accurate.

3. **No Occurrences**:
   - If `char` is not found, it returns `s` unchanged, which is correct behavior according to the problem description.

### Coverage of Edge Cases
- **Single Character Occurrence**: The function correctly handles strings where the character appears only once by utilizing `s.replace`.
- **Multiple Occurrences**: When `char` appears more than once, it properly constructs the result by slicing the string.
- **No Occurrences**: The function returns the original string correctly.

### Conclusion
The program performs its specified task successfully for all outlined scenarios and adheres to the problem statement by removing both the first and last occurrence of the specified character from the string. 

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
