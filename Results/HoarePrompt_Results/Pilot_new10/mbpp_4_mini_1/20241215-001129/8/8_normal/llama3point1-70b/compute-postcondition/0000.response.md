The variable `first_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.find(char)`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is not found in `s`, the method returns -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `char` is a single character, and `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if not found.**
