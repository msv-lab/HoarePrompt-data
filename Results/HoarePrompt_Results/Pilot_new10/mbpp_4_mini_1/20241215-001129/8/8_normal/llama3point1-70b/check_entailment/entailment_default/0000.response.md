The provided function attempts to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a given string. 

Analyzing the implementation:
1. It uses `s.find(char)` to identify the index of the first occurrence and `s.rfind(char)` for the last occurrence.
2. It handles three cases:
   - If `char` appears only once, it correctly removes that occurrence.
   - If `char` appears more than once, it removes both the first and last occurrences as described.
   - If `char` is not present, it returns the original string unchanged.

However, let's examine a potential edge case. If `char` appears within the string's first or last index on both ends (i.e. if the character is at index 0 and also at the last index of a string), the function may not behave as expected due to the concatenation method used. Specifically, if there is a case where `char` is repeated at the beginning and end of the string, such as in `s = "abba"` and `char = "a"`, the expected output should be `"bb"`. The function, however, will return `s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]`, which would yield just `"b"` as it removes the two 'a's but ends up with an incorrect removal logic in terms of leaving the structure intact.

Given this analysis of the potential problem, the function does not correctly handle every edge case described in the problem, and there are scenarios where its behavior does not align with the expected output.

Correctness: **False**.
