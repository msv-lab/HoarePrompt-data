Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the character appears only once in the string. According to the problem description, if the character appears only once, the program should remove that single occurrence. However, the current implementation removes it from the string but then attempts to find and manipulate the last occurrence, which is not necessary since there is only one occurrence.

For example, if we test with the input `func_1("hello", "h")`, the expected output should be `"ello"` because "h" occurs once, and it should be removed. However, due to the logic of the program, it doesn't give the correct output when only one occurrence is present.

This flaw in logic indicates that the program is not correct for every potential case, confirming that the Correctness is **False**.
