Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Removing First Occurrence**: The section of code that handles the case where the character appears only once uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, which effectively removes that single occurrence of the character from the string.

2. **Removing Last Occurrence**: For cases where the character appears more than once, the program correctly identifies the first and last occurrences using `s.find(char)` and `s.rfind(char)`. It constructs a new string that comprises:
   - The substring before the first occurrence.
   - The substring between the first and last occurrences (after removing the character at the first index).
   - The substring after the last occurrence (excluding the character at the last index).

3. **Handling Character Not Present**: The program also addresses the scenario when the character isn't found in the string. In this case, it simply returns the original string `s`, complying with the requirement of not altering it.

Thus, the function handles:
- Removing the first occurrence if it appears once.
- Removing both occurrences if it appears more than once.
- Returning the original string if the character is not present.

This validates that the implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
