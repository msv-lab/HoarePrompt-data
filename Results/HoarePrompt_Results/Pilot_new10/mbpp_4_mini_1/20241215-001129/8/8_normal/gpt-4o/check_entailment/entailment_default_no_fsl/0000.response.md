Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where a string has only one occurrence of the specified character. The implementation returns the original string when `ch` appears only once; however, according to the problem description, the first and last occurrences should also be removed in this case, which would effectively remove that single occurrence.

For example, if the input is `func_1('a', 'a')`, the expected output should be an empty string `''`, but the actual output returned by the code would be `'a'`. Therefore, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, it is incorrect.
