The provided program is aimed at removing the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string. Let's analyze it based on the problem description and the implementation.

### Problem Description
The function must:
1. Remove the first occurrence of a given character from the string.
2. Remove the last occurrence of the same character from the string.

### Annotated Program Analysis
1. **Finding Occurrences:**
   - `first_index = s.find(ch)`: This correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of `ch`.
   - `last_index = s.rfind(ch)`: This finds the index of the last occurrence of `ch`.
   
2. **Conditions for Return:**
   - The program returns `s` unchanged if:
     - The character `ch` is not found (-1).
     - The character occurs at most once (where `first_index` equals `last_index`).
   This behavior conforms to the problem statement since if `ch` does not appear in the string or appears only once, it should return the original string as there is no valid removal.

3. **Removing Occurrences:**
   - In the case where `ch` occurs more than once (`first_index != last_index`), it constructs a new string:
     ```python
     return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
     ```
   - This concatenation takes:
     - All characters before the first occurrence: `s[:first_index]`
     - All characters between the first and last occurrences, without the first occurrence: `s[first_index + 1:last_index]`
     - All characters after the last occurrence: `s[last_index + 1:]`
   - Hence, the first and last occurrences of `ch` are correctly removed.

### Edge Cases
- For inputs where `ch` is not present, such as `func_1('hello', 'x')`, the function correctly returns `'hello'`.
- For inputs where `ch` appears only once, such as `func_1('hello', 'h')`, it also returns `'hello'`.

### Conclusion
The implementation adheres to the problem description by correctly handling the specified requirements. All cases have been accounted for (no occurrences, single occurrence, multiple occurrences) are processed as required by the problem.

Thus, considering the function meets the criteria established by the problem description:

Correctness: **True**
