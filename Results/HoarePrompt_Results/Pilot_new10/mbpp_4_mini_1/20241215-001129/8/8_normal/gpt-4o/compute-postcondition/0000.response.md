The variable `first_index` is assigned the value of the position of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is found in `s`, `first_index` will be a non-negative integer representing the index of the first occurrence; otherwise, it will be `-1`. The state of the other variables remains the same.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.**
