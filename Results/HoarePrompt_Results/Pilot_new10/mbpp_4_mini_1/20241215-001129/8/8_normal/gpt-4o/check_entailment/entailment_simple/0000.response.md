The provided Python function `func_1(s, ch)` is required to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character `ch` from the string `s`. 

Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. **Finding Indices**: The function uses `s.find(ch)` to get the index of the first occurrence of `ch` and `s.rfind(ch)` to get the index of the last occurrence. This is correctly implemented.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If `ch` is not found in `s` (i.e., both `first_index` and `last_index` are `-1`), or if `ch` appears only once (i.e., `first_index` is equal to `last_index`), the function simply returns `s` as it is. This correctly addresses cases where no removal is needed.

3. **Removing Characters**: If `ch` occurs more than once, the program constructs a new string by slicing:
   - `s[:first_index]` retrieves everything before the first occurrence.
   - `s[first_index + 1:last_index]` retrieves everything between the first and last occurrences, omitting the first occurrence.
   - `s[last_index + 1:]` retrieves everything after the last occurrence.
   - These parts are concatenated together to form the result.

The implementation seems correct, and it handles various scenarios based on the problem statement. However, let's confirm this by checking some potential edge cases that the program will handle:

- If `s` is "hello" and `ch` is "l", the first `l` is at index 2, and the last `l` is at index 3. The result is "heo", which matches the requirement.
- If `s` is "abcda" and `ch` is "a", the first `a` is at index 0, and the last `a` is at index 4. The result is "bcd", which is correct.
- If `s` is "PHP" and `ch` is "P", the first `P` is at index 0, and the last `P` is at index 2. The result is "H," which fulfills the requirement.

Examining the core functionality, for different inputs of `s` and `ch`, the program will always produce the expected behavior. It accurately removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s`, as required.

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the problem description is established, and it handles all specified cases as expected.

Correctness: **True**
