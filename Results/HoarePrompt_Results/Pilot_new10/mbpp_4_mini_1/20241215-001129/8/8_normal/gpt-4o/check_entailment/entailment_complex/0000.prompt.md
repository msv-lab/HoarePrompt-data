You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string `s`, which can be any string as `ch` is not found or appears an equal number of times (first and last occurrences are the same).
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, both `first_index` and `last_index` are not equal to -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index` (indicating that `ch` occurs more than once in `s`).
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns the string 's' with the first and last occurrences of 'ch' removed, where 'first_index' is the index of the first occurrence of 'ch' in 's', and 'last_index' is the index of the last occurrence of 'ch' in 's', and both occurrences exist.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`, returning `s` unchanged if `ch` is not found in `s`, or if `ch` appears only once in `s`. If `ch` occurs more than once, the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
