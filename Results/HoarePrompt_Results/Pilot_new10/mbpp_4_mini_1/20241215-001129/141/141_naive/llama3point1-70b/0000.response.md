To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to determine whether it correctly checks if the frequency of each digit in an integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Program Analysis:
Problem description: Check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Program provided:
```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Input Conversion**: The input integer `n` is converted to a string `str_n` to analyze each digit.
2. **Frequency Count**: For each digit (`digit`), the frequency of that digit in `str_n` is counted using `str_n.count(digit)`.
3. **Comparison**: It checks if this count is greater than the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
4. **Return**:
   - If any digit's frequency exceeds its value, it returns `False`.
   - If all digits satisfy the condition, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Zero as a Digit**: If `n` contains the digit '0', then the program would still return `True` since `count('0')` cannot be greater than `0`.
- **Single Digit and Repeated Digits**: For example, `n = 222`, where the frequency of '2' is `3`, but is not checked against the logic appropriately since `3 > 2` should return `False`.

### Test Cases:
Testing the program against several inputs:
- Input: `100` should return `False` because it contains a '0' which appears `1` time where it should be less than or equal to `0`.
- Input: `222` should return `False` since '2' appears `3` times.
- Input: `21` should return `True` since '2' appears once and '1' appears once.

The program fails in scenarios where a digit has to appear more than it should be allowed according to the description, particularly with `0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the digit frequency exceeds the limit set by the digit's value itself.

Correctness: **False**.
