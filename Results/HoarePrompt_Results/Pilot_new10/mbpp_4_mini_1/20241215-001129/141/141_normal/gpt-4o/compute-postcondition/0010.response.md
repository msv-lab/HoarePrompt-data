The value of `frequency[digit]` is assigned `1`. The variable `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, which is the string representation of `n` (where `n` is greater than or equal to 1). After this assignment, `frequency` will update to include the key `digit` with the value of `1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, and `frequency` has been updated such that `frequency[digit] = 1`.**
