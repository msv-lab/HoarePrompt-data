Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified a flaw in the program: it fails to handle the digit '0'. The reasoning provided points out that if the input contains a digit '0', the condition should return `False` when the frequency of '0' exceeds 0, which is not addressed in the function. Thus, the assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate, as the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential inputs.
