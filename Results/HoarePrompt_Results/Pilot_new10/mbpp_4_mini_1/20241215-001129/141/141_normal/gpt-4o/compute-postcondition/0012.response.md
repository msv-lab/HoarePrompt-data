According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `digit_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `digit_str` contains the string representation of `n`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `digit_str` must have at least one character. The loop variable `digit` takes the value of each character in `digit_str`. 

Given that `digit` is the second character of `digit_str`, for the loop to execute one more time, `digit` needs to be the third character of `digit_str`. This means that `digit_str` must have at least three characters for the loop to continue executing.

So the new states should be adjusted as follows:

1. `n` should remain greater than or equal to 1.
2. `digit_str` must be such that it has at least three characters.
3. `digit` would then be the third character of `digit_str`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n` that must have at least 3 characters, and `digit` is the third character of `digit_str`.**
