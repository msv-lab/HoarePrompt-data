`frequency[digit]` is assigned the value `1`, indicating that we are adding the first occurrence of the `digit` key to the `frequency` dictionary. Since it was stated that `digit` is not a key in `frequency`, after this line of code is executed, `digit` will now have a key with a value of `1` in the dictionary. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character of `digit_str`, `frequency` is a dictionary with key `digit` and value `1`.**
