Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identified that the function `func_1` does not handle the case of digit `0` correctly. If a digit like `0` appears in the input number, its frequency cannot exceed 0, but if it does appear, the function will incorrectly return `True`. This is a critical flaw in the logic as per the problem description.

The annotations confirm that the function checks the frequency of each digit against its integer value but do not rectify the oversight regarding the handling of `0`. Thus, the verdict of the original assessment remains accurate, given that `func_1(1002)` would indeed return `True` incorrectly, illustrating that the program fails to satisfy the required condition for all valid inputs.
