Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks the frequency of each digit in `n`. It returns `False` if the count of any digit exceeds its integer value. If all digit counts are less than or equal to their respective digit values, it returns `True`. The function doesn't handle invalid inputs (like negative numbers) explicitly, though the function is intended for non-negative integers according to the initial condition. **
