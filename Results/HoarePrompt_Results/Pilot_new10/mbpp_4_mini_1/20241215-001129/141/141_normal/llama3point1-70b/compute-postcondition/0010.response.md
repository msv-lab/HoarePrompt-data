Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` remains the same but must have at least one more character beyond the current `digit`, and `digit` is the next character in `str_n`. If `str_n` contains more occurrences of `digit` than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False.***
