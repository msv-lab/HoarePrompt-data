Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, if the loop executes then for every `digit` in `str_n`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If the loop does not execute, the condition holds trivially since there are no `digit` characters to evaluate.**
