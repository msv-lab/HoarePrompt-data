The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function has several cases for its output: 

- In Case 1, it returns `False`, indicating that the count of 'digit' in the string representation of `n` is not greater than the integer value of 'digit'.
- In Case 2, it returns `False`.
- In Case 3, it returns `False`.
- In Case 4, it returns `True`, confirming that the condition holds for each digit in the string representation of the non-negative integer `n` or trivially holds if `n` is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return `False` in certain conditions, while returning `True` when the specified condition holds for each digit or when `n` is 0.  
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `False` in specific conditions and `True` when conditions hold for each digit in `n` or when `n` is 0.**
