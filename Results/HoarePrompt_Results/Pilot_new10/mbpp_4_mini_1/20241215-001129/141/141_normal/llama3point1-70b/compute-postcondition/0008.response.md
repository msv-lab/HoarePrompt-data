According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `str_n`. For the loop to execute one more time, it must move to the next character in `str_n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have the variable `digit` holding the next character from `str_n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `digit` must be set to the next character in the string and its position must also increment by one.

As it stands, if `digit` is currently the last character in `str_n`, the loop would not execute again. Thus, `str_n` must have at least one more character following the current `digit`. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` remains the same but must have at least one more character beyond the current `digit`, `digit` is the next character in `str_n`**
