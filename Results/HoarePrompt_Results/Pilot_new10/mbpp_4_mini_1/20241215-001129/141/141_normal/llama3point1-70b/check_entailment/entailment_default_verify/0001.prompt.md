You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To verify the program's correctness, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function against the problem description provided.

The problem requires that the function checks whether the frequency of each digit in the given integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Here is a breakdown of the program logic:

1. Convert the integer `n` into a string `str_n` to iterate through each digit.
2. Use a loop to check each digit in the string representation.
3. For each digit, count how many times it appears in the string (using `str_n.count(digit)`) and compare it to the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
4. If the frequency of any digit exceeds the digit itself, return `False`.
5. If all digits satisfy the condition, return `True`.

We will now analyze this logic with specific cases:

### Test Cases

1. **Input**: `122`  
   - Frequency of `1`: 1 (≤ 1)  
   - Frequency of `2`: 2 (≤ 2)  
   - Result: `True`

2. **Input**: `111`  
   - Frequency of `1`: 3 (not ≤ 1)  
   - Result: `False`

3. **Input**: `234`  
   - Frequency of `2`: 1 (≤ 2)  
   - Frequency of `3`: 1 (≤ 3)  
   - Frequency of `4`: 1 (≤ 4)  
   - Result: `True`

4. **Input**: `221`  
   - Frequency of `2`: 2 (≤ 2)  
   - Frequency of `1`: 1 (≤ 1)  
   - Result: `True`

5. **Input**: `4444`  
   - Frequency of `4`: 4 (≤ 4)  
   - Result: `True`

### Potential Edge Cases

6. **Input**: `0`  
   - Frequency of `0`: 1 (not ≤ 0)  
   - Result: `False`

7. **Input**: `1111`  
   - Frequency of `1`: 4 (not ≤ 1)  
   - Result: `False`

8. **Input**: `10000000`  
   - Frequency of `1`: 1 (≤ 1)  
   - Frequency of `0`: 7 (not ≤ 0)  
   - Result: `False`

After considering these cases, we notice that the function does not handle cases involving the digit `0`. As demonstrated with the input `0`, or other numbers that include `0` but have higher counts: in such cases, since the frequency of `0` cannot exceed `0`, the program should return `False`, but it does not check for this appropriately since `count` could lead to false positives.

### Conclusion
The program fails to correctly address the condition for the digit `0` in general cases where it appears, hence it is not correct. 

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if, for each digit in its string representation, the count of that digit does not exceed its integer value. It returns `False` if any digit occurs more times than its value; otherwise, it returns `True`. This includes the case where `n` is 0, which trivially satisfies the condition. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
