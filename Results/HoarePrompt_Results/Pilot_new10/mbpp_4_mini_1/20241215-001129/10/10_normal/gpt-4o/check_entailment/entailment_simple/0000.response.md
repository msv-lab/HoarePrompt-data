Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1(base, height, length)` takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. These correspond appropriately to the problem description where the base represents the area of the triangular base, height represents the height of the triangular prism, and length represents the length of the prism.

2. **Volume Calculation**: Inside the function, the area of the triangular base is calculated using the formula \( \text{base\_area} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). The volume of the triangular prism is then calculated by multiplying this base area by the length of the prism, which is consistent with the formula for the volume of a triangular prism: 

   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}
   \]

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed volume, fulfilling the requirement to output the volume of the triangular prism accurately.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test the function with specific values, and since all assertions pass, this indicates that the function behaves as intended for those cases.

Overall, the program accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description.
