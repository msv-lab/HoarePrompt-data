You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

The problem description requires a function to compute the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is given by:

\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
\]

The base area of a triangle is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

Where \( b \) is the base length of the triangle and \( h \) is the height of the triangle. Therefore, the complete formula for the volume of a triangular prism would be:

\[
V = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h\right) \times l
\]

where \( l \) is the length of the prism.

Now, letâ€™s review the program provided:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

### Breakdown of the code:
- It correctly computes the base area of the triangle using \( b \times h / 2 \).
- It then multiplies the base area by the length \( l \).

### Potential edge cases:
1. **Zero values**: If any of the inputs (b, h, or l) are zero, the function should correctly return 0 because the volume of the prism would indeed be zero.
   - Example: `func_1(0, 5, 10)` should return 0.
  
2. **Negative values**: The function does not explicitly handle negative input values. A negative base, height, or length does not make physical sense for calculating volume. The function would return a negative volume, which is not valid.
   - Example: `func_1(-1, 5, 10)` would return -25, which is incorrect for volume.

3. **Non-numeric input**: The function does not have type checks, so passing a string or other non-numeric type could cause a runtime error.
   - Example: `func_1('a', 5, 10)` would raise a TypeError.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case given the following points:
- It does not handle negative input values correctly, which could lead to invalid volume calculations.
- It lacks input validation for non-numeric types.

Because of these issues, the program is not considered correct.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts three parameters, `b`, `h`, and `l`, which are expected to be positive floats representing the base, height, and length of a triangular prism. It calculates and returns the volume of the prism using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\). However, although the function requires all inputs to be positive, there is no validation in the code to ensure that `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive floats, which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors if negative values or non-float types are passed. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
