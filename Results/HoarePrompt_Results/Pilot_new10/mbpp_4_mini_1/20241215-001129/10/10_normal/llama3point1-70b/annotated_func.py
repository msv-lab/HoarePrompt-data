#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive float representing the base of the triangular prism, h is a positive float representing the height of the triangular prism, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula (base * height / 2) * length, where b is a positive float representing the base, h is a positive float representing the height, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters, `b`, `h`, and `l`, which are expected to be positive floats representing the base, height, and length of a triangular prism. It calculates and returns the volume of the prism using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\). However, although the function requires all inputs to be positive, there is no validation in the code to ensure that `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive floats, which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors if negative values or non-float types are passed.
