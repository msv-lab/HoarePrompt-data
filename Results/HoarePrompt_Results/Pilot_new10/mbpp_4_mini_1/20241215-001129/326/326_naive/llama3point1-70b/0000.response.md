To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting:** The program sorts the array first, which is a valid step as it places elements in order, making it easier to calculate differences between adjacent elements.

2. **Finding the Minimum Difference:** The program initializes `min_diff` to infinity, ensuring any actual difference calculated will be less than this initial value. It then iterates through the sorted array and calculates the difference between each pair of adjacent elements.

3. **Return Value:** The function returns the minimum difference found.

### Test Case Consideration:
To determine if there are issues with the program, we should consider various edge cases:

- **Empty Array:** If `arr` is empty, then calling the function would lead to an index out of range error since there would be no elements to compute differences.

- **Single Element Array:** If the array has only one element, similarly, the minimum difference cannot be defined, and the function would again result in an error attempting to access an element that does not exist.

- **All Elements are the Same:** In this case, the difference will always be 0, and the function will return 0, which is expected.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program fails to handle cases where the input array is either empty or contains only one element, leading to potential errors or undefined behavior.

Correctness: **False**.
