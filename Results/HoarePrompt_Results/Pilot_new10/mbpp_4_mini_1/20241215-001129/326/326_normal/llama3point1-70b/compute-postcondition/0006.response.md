Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is set to `diff` if `diff` is less than `min_diff`, where `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. If `diff` is not less than `min_diff`, the value of `min_diff` remains unchanged.***
