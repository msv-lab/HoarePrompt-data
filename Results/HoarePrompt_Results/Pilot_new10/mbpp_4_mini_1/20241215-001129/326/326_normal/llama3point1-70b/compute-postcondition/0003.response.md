The variable `diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between the `i`-th and `(i+1)`-th elements of the sorted list `arr`. The state of `arr` and `target` is not affected by this assignment, and the value of `min_diff` remains positive infinity and `i` remains 0. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers containing at least 2 elements, `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` will yield valid integer values. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])**
