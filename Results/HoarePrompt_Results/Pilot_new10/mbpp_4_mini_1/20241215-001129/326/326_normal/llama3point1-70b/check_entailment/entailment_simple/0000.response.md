Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. However, the implementation only calculates the difference between adjacent elements in the sorted array. This means that it could potentially miss smaller differences that may exist between non-adjacent elements. 

For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 6, 10]`. The sorted array remains `[1, 3, 6, 10]`, and the differences calculated will be:
- Between 1 and 3: 2
- Between 3 and 6: 3
- Between 6 and 10: 4

Here, the minimum difference is 2. However, if we had an array like `[1, 4, 2]`, which when sorted is `[1, 2, 4]`, the adjacent differences will yield:
- 1 and 2: 1
- 2 and 4: 2 
So, the minimum difference is correctly calculated as 1.

However, if we consider a case of `[5, 3, 2, 8]` which would sort to `[2, 3, 5, 8]`, the adjacent differences will result in minimum difference 1. But if the original array contained elements that are equally valued or closely valued but were not adjacent in the sorted arrangement, those differences could yield smaller values.

The program fails to fully adhere to the problem requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements. It only focuses on adjacent pairs and does not explore all possible pairs in the array, which could lead to inaccurate results if there are non-adjacent pairs with a smaller difference. 

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it that it is incorrect.
