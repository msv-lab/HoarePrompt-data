#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in `arr`. If `arr` contains fewer than 2 elements, `min_diff` remains positive infinity.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list 'arr', denoted as 'min_diff'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It returns the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`. If `arr` contains fewer than 2 elements, the function will return positive infinity since the calculation of differences is not feasible. However, the variable `target` is accepted as a parameter but is not used in the function, making it irrelevant to the final output.
