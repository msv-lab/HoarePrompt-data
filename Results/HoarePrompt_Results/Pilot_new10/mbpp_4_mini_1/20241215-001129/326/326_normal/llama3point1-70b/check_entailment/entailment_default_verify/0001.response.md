The original assessment accurately identifies that the function does not handle cases where the input array is empty or contains only one element. According to the problem description, finding a minimum difference requires at least two elements in the array. The function returns positive infinity for both cases, which is not a valid response based on the problem's requirements. 

The output hints also confirm that if the array contains fewer than 2 elements, the function will return infinity, further solidifying the original assessment's correctness. The use of the `target` parameter, while irrelevant, does not affect the core functionality of finding the minimum difference, but it does indicate a lack of adherence to clarity in function design.

Thus, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
