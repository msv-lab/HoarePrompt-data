In this case, `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. The variable `diff` is known to be less than `min_diff` prior to this assignment. Following this assignment, `min_diff` will no longer remain positive infinity but will take on the value of `diff`, which is a positive value since it is the absolute difference between two elements in a sorted list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.**
