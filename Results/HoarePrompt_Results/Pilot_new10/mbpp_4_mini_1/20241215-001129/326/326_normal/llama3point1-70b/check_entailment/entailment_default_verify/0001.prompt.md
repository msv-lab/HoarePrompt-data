You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze what the program is doing versus what it is required to do.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

### Analysis:
- The input for the function `func_1` is an array, but it also has an unused parameter `target`.
- The array is sorted, which is a good step as it allows us to check adjacent elements for the minimum difference.
- A variable `min_diff` is initialized to infinity, which will hold the minimum difference found.
- The function iterates through the sorted array, checking the difference between each adjacent pair.

### Key Observations:
1. The function does not account for the case where the input array may be empty or contain only one element. In these cases, it is impossible to find a difference between two elements.
   
   - Example 1 (Empty Array): 
     ```python
     func_1([], 0)  # Should ideally return some error or indicative value. But returns inf.
     ```
   - Example 2 (Single Element):
     ```python
     func_1([5], 0)  # Should also return an error or indicative value. But returns inf.
     ```

2. The `target` parameter is irrelevant to the function and adds no value. It should be removed to align the function with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle edge cases where the array is empty or contains only one element, the function would not work correctly in these scenarios.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It returns the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`. If `arr` contains fewer than 2 elements, the function will return positive infinity since the calculation of differences is not feasible. However, the variable `target` is accepted as a parameter but is not used in the function, making it irrelevant to the final output. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
