You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting:** The program sorts the array first, which is a valid step as it places elements in order, making it easier to calculate differences between adjacent elements.

2. **Finding the Minimum Difference:** The program initializes `min_diff` to infinity, ensuring any actual difference calculated will be less than this initial value. It then iterates through the sorted array and calculates the difference between each pair of adjacent elements.

3. **Return Value:** The function returns the minimum difference found.

### Test Case Consideration:
To determine if there are issues with the program, we should consider various edge cases:

- **Empty Array:** If `arr` is empty, then calling the function would lead to an index out of range error since there would be no elements to compute differences.

- **Single Element Array:** If the array has only one element, similarly, the minimum difference cannot be defined, and the function would again result in an error attempting to access an element that does not exist.

- **All Elements are the Same:** In this case, the difference will always be 0, and the function will return 0, which is expected.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program fails to handle cases where the input array is either empty or contains only one element, leading to potential errors or undefined behavior.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It returns the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`. If `arr` contains fewer than 2 elements, the function will return positive infinity since the calculation of differences is not feasible. However, the variable `target` is accepted as a parameter but is not used in the function, making it irrelevant to the final output. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
