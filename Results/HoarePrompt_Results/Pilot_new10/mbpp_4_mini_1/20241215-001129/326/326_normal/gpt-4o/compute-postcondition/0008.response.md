The line `min_diff = diff` assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Prior to this assignment, `min_diff` is equal to `float('inf')`, and `diff` is the result of the expression `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Since the current value of `diff` is less than `min_diff`, after the assignment, `min_diff` will be equal to the value of `diff`. 

Other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is updated only for `min_diff` to reflect this new value.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` that is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `diff` is equal to `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]` (and is less than the previous `min_diff`).**
