The `arr` variable is assigned the sorted version of itself. The sorting operation does not alter the value of `n`, which remains equal to the length of `arr` after sorting. The original precondition of `arr` being a list of integers and `n` being a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 remains valid, with the only change being that `arr` is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.**
