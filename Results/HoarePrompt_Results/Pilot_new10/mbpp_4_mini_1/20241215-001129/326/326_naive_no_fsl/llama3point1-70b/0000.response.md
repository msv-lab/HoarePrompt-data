To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze what the program is doing versus what it is required to do.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

### Analysis:
- The input for the function `func_1` is an array, but it also has an unused parameter `target`.
- The array is sorted, which is a good step as it allows us to check adjacent elements for the minimum difference.
- A variable `min_diff` is initialized to infinity, which will hold the minimum difference found.
- The function iterates through the sorted array, checking the difference between each adjacent pair.

### Key Observations:
1. The function does not account for the case where the input array may be empty or contain only one element. In these cases, it is impossible to find a difference between two elements.
   
   - Example 1 (Empty Array): 
     ```python
     func_1([], 0)  # Should ideally return some error or indicative value. But returns inf.
     ```
   - Example 2 (Single Element):
     ```python
     func_1([5], 0)  # Should also return an error or indicative value. But returns inf.
     ```

2. The `target` parameter is irrelevant to the function and adds no value. It should be removed to align the function with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle edge cases where the array is empty or contains only one element, the function would not work correctly in these scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
