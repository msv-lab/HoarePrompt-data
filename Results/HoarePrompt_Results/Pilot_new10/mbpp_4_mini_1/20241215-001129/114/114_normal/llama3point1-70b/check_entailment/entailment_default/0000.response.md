Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the element `elem` within the tuple `tup` using the built-in `count` method of tuples. The output hints confirm that the function properly handles elements of any data type and correctly returns the count, including returning 0 if the element is not present in the tuple. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities identified in the code, and it aligns with the problem description requirements for all potential cases.
