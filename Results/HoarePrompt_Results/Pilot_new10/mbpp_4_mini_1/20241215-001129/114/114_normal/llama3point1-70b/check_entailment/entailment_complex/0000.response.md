Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes in two parameters: a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`. The function uses the built-in tuple method `.count()` to count and return the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`. 

Here is the explanation of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Function Signature**: The function accepts a tuple and an element, which matches the expected inputs.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The code correctly utilizes `tup.count(elem)` to count and return the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.
3. **Handling of Non-present Elements**: According to Python's `.count()` method, if `elem` is not found in `tup`, it correctly returns 0, aligning with the expected behavior described.

Thus, every case defined within the problem description is adequately managed by the program, ensuring its correctness.
