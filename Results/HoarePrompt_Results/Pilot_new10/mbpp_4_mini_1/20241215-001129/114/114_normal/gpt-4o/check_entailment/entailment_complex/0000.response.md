Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an `element` as inputs and uses the built-in `count()` method of the tuple to count the occurrences of the `element` in the `tup`. This directly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description, which specifies that the function should count occurrences of an element in a tuple.

### Explanation:
1. **Function Input**: The function accepts a tuple, which is confirmed by the input data used in the assertions.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: The use of `tup.count(element)` efficiently accomplishes the task of counting how many times `element` appears in the `tup`, thereby meeting the main requirement of the problem statement.
3. **Correctness of Test Cases**: The provided assertions test various cases:
   - The first assertion checks for an element not in the tuple (resulting in 0).
   - The second checks for occurrences of an element that appears three times.
   - The third checks for an element that appears four times.
   All these cases are handled correctly by the implementation.

### Edge Cases:
While the function does not handle cases where the input is not a tuple or where the element might not be comparable (which could lead to TypeErrors), the problem description does not specify any restrictions on the types of inputs. Therefore, as long as the inputs follow the expected types (a tuple for the first argument and any type for the second), the function works correctly and satisfies the problem description.

Thus, the implementation meets the stated requirements, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct as per the specifications provided.
