#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of 'element' in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the count of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`. It does not handle cases where `tup` is not a tuple or where `element` is not comparable to the items in `tup`, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
