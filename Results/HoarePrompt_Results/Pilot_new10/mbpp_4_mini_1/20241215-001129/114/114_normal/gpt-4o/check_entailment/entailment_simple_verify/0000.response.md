Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a specified `element` in a given tuple `tup` using the built-in `count()` method of tuples. The provided assertions serve as valid test cases and demonstrate the function's correct functionality: 

- It returns `0` for the element `4`, which is not present in the tuple (correct).
- It accurately returns `3` for the element `10`, which appears three times (correct).
- It accurately returns `4` for the element `8`, which appears four times (correct).

The annotations confirm that the program correctly identifies the `tup` as a tuple and can handle any data type for the `element`. Additionally, given the assumption that the input will always be valid, the program's correctness stands confirmed based on the provided information.
