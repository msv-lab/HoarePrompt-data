Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirement of counting occurrences of a specified element within a tuple. The function `tup.count(elem)` is a built-in method in Python that directly counts how many times `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`. 

The function will return the correct count for various scenarios, including:

1. **Element is present multiple times**: If `tup` is `(1, 2, 3, 2, 1)` and `elem` is `1`, it will return `2`.
2. **Element is not present**: If `tup` is `(1, 2, 3)` and `elem` is `4`, it will return `0`.
3. **Empty tuple**: If `tup` is `()` and `elem` is `1`, it will return `0`.
4. **Element is of different data types**: If `tup` is `(1, 2, '2', 2)` and `elem` is `2`, it will return `2` and for `elem` as `'2'`, it will return `1`.

Since I cannot identify any cases where the function would return an incorrect count according to the problem description, the function behaves as expected.
