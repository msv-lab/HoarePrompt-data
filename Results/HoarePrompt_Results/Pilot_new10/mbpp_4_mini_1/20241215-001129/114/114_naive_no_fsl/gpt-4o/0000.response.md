Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element, and counts the occurrences of that element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method. 

Let's analyze the provided assertions:
1. `assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4) == 0` - This correctly checks that the element `4` occurs `0` times in the tuple.
2. `assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10) == 3` - This correctly counts `3` occurrences of the element `10`.
3. `assert func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8) == 4` - This correctly counts `4` occurrences of the element `8`.

The method used (`tup.count(element)`) is appropriate for counting occurrences in a tuple, and the function handles all edge cases properly:
- It returns `0` for an element that doesn't exist in the tuple.
- It correctly counts multiple occurrences of the same element.
- It operates as expected regardless of the order or position of the elements in the tuple.

Since the provided test cases cover various scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected, there are no found edge cases or missing logic. Thus, the implementation is correct.

Hence, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
