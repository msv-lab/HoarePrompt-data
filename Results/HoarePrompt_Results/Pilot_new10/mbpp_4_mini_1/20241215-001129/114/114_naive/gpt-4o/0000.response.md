Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a specified `element` in a given tuple `tup` using the built-in `count()` method of tuples. The provided assertions serve as test cases that demonstrate the correct functionality: 

- For the element `4`, which is not present in the tuple, it returns `0` (correct).
- For the element `10`, which appears three times, it returns `3` (correct).
- For the element `8`, which appears four times, it returns `4` (correct).

Since the function correctly handles all cases based on the problem description and provided examples, it is deemed correct.
