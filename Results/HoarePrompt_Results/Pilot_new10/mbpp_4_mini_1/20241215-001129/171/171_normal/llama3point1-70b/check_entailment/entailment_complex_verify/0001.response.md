Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the program confirms that the function behaves correctly by returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. The function is designed to handle valid integer inputs, as stated in the problem description. Since we assume valid input and the function works as intended for all integers, the program is correct.
