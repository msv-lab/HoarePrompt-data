Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1(n)` accurately detects the parity of an integer `n`. The function employs the modulo operation to differentiate between odd and even numbers, returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. The annotated version of the code aligns with this assessment, confirming that the function does what is intended based on the problem description. There are no unhandled edge cases since the assumption is made that the input will always be a valid integer. Thus, the original assessment's conclusion of correctness holds true.
