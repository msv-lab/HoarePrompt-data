Correctness: **True**

The provided program functions correctly according to the problem description. 

- The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the integer `n` is odd by evaluating the expression `n % 2 != 0`. 
- The assertion tests verify that the function returns `False` for even numbers (like 12 and 10) and `True` for an odd number (like 7). 

Since all tested values are integers and the logic for determining odd/even parity is correctly implemented, the code handles the provided cases accurately. The hints also confirm that the function is designed to return the expected results for odd and even integers. There is no indication of any missing edge cases that could lead to incorrect results. 

Thus, the code is correct for the defined requirements.
