Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1` returns `True` when the input is an odd integer (when `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` when the input is even. The assertions provided check various cases and align perfectly with the expected outputs for odd and even integers. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the program is indeed correct based on the provided information.
