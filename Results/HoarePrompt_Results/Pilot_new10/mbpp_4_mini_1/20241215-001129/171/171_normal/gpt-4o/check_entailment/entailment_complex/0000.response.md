Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly follows the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function's purpose is to determine whether the parity of a given integer is odd.

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a single integer parameter `n`.

2. **Parity Check**: It checks the parity by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`. 
   - If `n` is odd, this expression returns `True` (since the modulus of an odd number with 2 will yield 1).
   - If `n` is even, this expression returns `False` (since the modulus of an even number with 2 will yield 0).

3. **Return Values**: 
   - The output is `True` when `n` is odd and `False` when it is even, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to find whether the parity of the number is odd or not.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the tested inputs:
   - `func_1(12)` returns `False` (even).
   - `func_1(7)` returns `True` (odd).
   - `func_1(10)` returns `False` (even).

Since the function correctly identifies odd integers and returns the appropriate boolean values as specified in the problem description, it is considered correct.
