Correctness: **True**

The provided program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1(n)` checks if the number `n` is odd by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`. This expression will return `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, which accurately reflects the definition of odd numbers.

2. The assertions present in the annotated program verify that the function behaves as expected:
   - For `func_1(12)`, it correctly returns `False` as 12 is even.
   - For `func_1(7)`, it returns `True` as 7 is odd.
   - For `func_1(10)`, it likewise returns `False` since 10 is even.

These cases demonstrate that the function correctly identifies odd and even numbers, aligning perfectly with the requirements stated in the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
