Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. It uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remainder when dividing by 2 is not equal to zero, which is the correct approach for checking odd parity. 

For every integer input:
- If `n` is odd (e.g., -1, 1, 3, 7, etc.), `n % 2` will equal 1, and the function will return `True`.
- If `n` is even (e.g., -2, 0, 4, 8, etc.), `n % 2` will equal 0, and the function will return `False`.

The function handles both positive and negative integers and zero appropriately. Thus, I cannot identify any input where it fails to work as intended based on the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
