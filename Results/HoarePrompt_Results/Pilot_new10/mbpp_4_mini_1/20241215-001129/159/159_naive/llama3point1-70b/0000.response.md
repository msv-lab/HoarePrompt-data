Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. It imports the `math` module to access the value of Ï€ (pi). 

This function works correctly for all valid inputs of radius and height, including edge cases where they are zero or positive values. The function does not account for negative inputs, which is typically not necessary for volume calculations in real-world scenarios, as a radius or height cannot be negative. However, since there is no explicit mention in the problem description regarding the handling of negative inputs, the function is considered correct in the context provided. 

As all potential cases I can think of (non-negative radius and height values) are handled correctly, the function meets the problem requirements.
