Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. 

This function operates as follows:
1. It takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`.
2. It computes the volume by applying the formula directly.
3. It returns the calculated volume as a floating-point number, which is appropriate since volume can be a non-integer value.

The formula used is mathematically correct, and it handles positive values for radius and height, which are the expected valid inputs for this context. There are no indications that it will fail for edge cases such as:
- A `radius` or `height` being zero (the expected output would correctly be `0.0` for a cone with no height or radius).
- Negative values for radius or height (the function will accept these, but in a geometric context, they don't make sense).

As all reasonable cases are covered by the function, and there is no scenario that I can think of where it would not compute the volume of a cone correctly, the program is deemed correct.
