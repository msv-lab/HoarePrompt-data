Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle invalid inputs, specifically negative values for the radius and height, which violates the expectation that both parameters should be non-negative. According to the problem description, the function is required to calculate the volume of a cone, but it must also ensure that the inputs meet the specified criteria (non-negative floats or integers). 

For example, if `func_1(-1, 5)` is called, it would result in a negative radius, which is not allowed according to the problem description. The function would still attempt to calculate the volume, leading to incorrect behavior and output. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the complete requirements of the problem description by not ensuring the validity of its inputs.
