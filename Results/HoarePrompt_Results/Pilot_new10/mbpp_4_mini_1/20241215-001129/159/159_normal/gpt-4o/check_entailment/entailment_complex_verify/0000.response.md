Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone: \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The annotated version confirms that the `func_1` function is designed to accept non-negative float or integer inputs for `radius` and `height`, which it then uses to compute the volume effectively. The assertions provided validate the correctness of the function against expected output values. Given that all test cases return the expected results and the function is adhering to the intended mathematical formula, the program meets the requirements set by the problem description. The notes about the lack of input validation do not affect the correctness of the program under the assumption that inputs will always be valid.
