Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \((1/3) * \pi * \text{radius}^2 * \text{height}\). However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle invalid inputs such as negative values or non-numeric types. For instance, if the function is called with negative values for either `radius` or `height`, it will yield an incorrect volume (likely a negative volume), which is not physically meaningful. Therefore, the function does not adhere to the complete requirements as stated in the problem description, leading to its incorrectness.
