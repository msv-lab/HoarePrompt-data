Final: **False**

While the function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone and passes the provided test cases, the annotated version identifies a significant flaw: the function does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative values or non-numeric types, which could lead to runtime errors.

The original assessment assumed that the program was correct, but it failed to account for the lack of input validation. Hence, the program is not robust against all expected inputs, which contradicts the assertion that it could handle arbitrary valid inputs reliably. Thus, the function is technically correct for the provided test cases, but the lack of input validation suggests that the program may not be fully correct in the context of robustness and error handling.
