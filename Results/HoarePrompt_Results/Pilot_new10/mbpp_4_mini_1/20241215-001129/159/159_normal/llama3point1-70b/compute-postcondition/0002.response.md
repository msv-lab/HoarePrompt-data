Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative integers or floating-point numbers. It returns the volume of a cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height. The function does not handle invalid input cases where `radius` or `height` could be negative or non-numeric, which may lead to incorrect results or exceptions. **
