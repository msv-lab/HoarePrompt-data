Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to calculate the volume of a cone. The mathematical formula for the volume of a cone is \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. 

In the provided function `func_1`, the parameters `radius` and `height` are expected to be non-negative integers or floating-point numbers. The program utilizes the `math.pi` constant to provide an accurate representation of Ï€ and performs the calculation as specified.

1. **Input validation**: The function assumes the inputs are valid per the problem description (i.e., they are non-negative). If the inputs were to violate this assumption (e.g., negative values), the function would still compute a value, which may not make sense in the context of volume. However, since the problem description does not specify the need for input validation, the function is deemed correct based on the stated requirements.

2. **Implementation**: The implementation directly corresponds to the required calculation, and there are no logical errors present in how the volume is computed.

Therefore, since the program meets the requirements set out in the problem description for finding the volume of a cone, it is correct.
