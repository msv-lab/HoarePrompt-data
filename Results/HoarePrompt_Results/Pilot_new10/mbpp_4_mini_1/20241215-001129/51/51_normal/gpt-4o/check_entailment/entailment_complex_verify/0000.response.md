Final: **True**

The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False** due to the potential for division by zero if an empty list is passed. However, the annotated version confirms that the program only processes non-empty lists. Since it is assumed that the input will always be valid and non-empty (as stated in the new guidance), the function `func_1` correctly computes the product of the numbers in the given non-empty list and divides by the length of that list. This aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate based on the provided annotations and the assumption of valid inputs.
