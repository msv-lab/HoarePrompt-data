The code `product *= num` performs an in-place multiplication of `product` by `num`, modifying the value of `product`. The initial state specifies that `numbers` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, and `num` is the second number in that list. 

Given that `product` is initially the value of `num`, after executing the line `product *= num`, the value of `product` will now be `num * num` (i.e., `num^2`). This operation does not change the other variables.

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers that must have at least 2 elements, `product` is the value of `num^2`, `num` is the second number in the list.**
