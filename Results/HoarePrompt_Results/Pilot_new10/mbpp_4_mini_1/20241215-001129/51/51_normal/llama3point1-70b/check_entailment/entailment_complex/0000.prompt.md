You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is the product of all elements in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of all elements in 'numbers', calculated as product divided by the length of the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats, computes the product of all the elements in the list, and returns the average as the product divided by the length of the list. However, this implementation incorrectly calculates the average by using the product instead of the sum; additionally, if the list contains only one element, the average returned is that element itself, but the logic does not handle lists appropriately when their product is zero. Thus, the function does not implement the standard average calculation correctly.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
