The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats, computes the product of all the elements in the list, and returns the average as the product divided by the length of the list. However, this implementation incorrectly calculates the average by using the product instead of the sum; additionally, if the list contains only one element, the average returned is that element itself, but the logic does not handle lists appropriately when their product is zero. Thus, the function does not implement the standard average calculation correctly.
