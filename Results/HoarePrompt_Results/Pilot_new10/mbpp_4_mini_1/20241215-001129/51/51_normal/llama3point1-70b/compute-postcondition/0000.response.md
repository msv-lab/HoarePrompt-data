The variable `product` is assigned the value of 1. There is no information about a change in other variables, and as the list `numbers` is not empty, it does not affect the condition. Therefore, other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty; `product` is 1**
