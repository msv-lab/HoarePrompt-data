Correctness: **False**

The function incorrectly calculates what it describes as an average by multiplying all numbers instead of summing them. According to the problem description, the task is to return the average, which should be the sum of all elements divided by their count. This fundamental misunderstanding leads to incorrect results in all situations. 

For example, for the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the expected average is `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`. However, the program will compute the product as `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`, and then divide it by `3`, resulting in `6 / 3 = 2`, which coincidentally gives the same numeral value in this specific case but is conceptually incorrect. 

In another case, if the input is `[0, 2, 3]`, the expected average should be `(0 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 1.67`. The code would compute the product as `0 * 2 * 3 = 0`, and then `0 / 3 = 0`, which is incorrect. Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all cases.
