You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides the result by the length of the list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Empty List Case:** 
   - If the input list `numbers` is empty (`[]`), the `len(numbers)` will return `0`. This will lead to a division by zero error when trying to execute `product / len(numbers)`, as dividing by zero is undefined in mathematics and will cause a runtime exception in Python.

2. **Normal Cases:** 
   - For a non-empty list, the program correctly multiplies all numbers together and divides that product by the length of the list.

3. **Negative Numbers and Zero:**
   - If the list includes zeros, the product will be `0`, and the result will be `0` (which is correct).
   - The program will also work with negative numbers, returning a negative value but mathematically accurate according to the description.

### Conclusion:
While the program works well for a variety of cases, the empty list case is a critical flaw where it does not handle the case as per the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not define what to do with an empty list, leading to a division by zero error.

Given this analysis, we can conclude:
Correctness: **False** 

The program fails when provided with an empty list, which is a fundamental case that needs to be handled.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats, computes the product of all the elements in the list, and returns the average as the product divided by the length of the list. However, this implementation incorrectly calculates the average by using the product instead of the sum; additionally, if the list contains only one element, the average returned is that element itself, but the logic does not handle lists appropriately when their product is zero. Thus, the function does not implement the standard average calculation correctly. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
