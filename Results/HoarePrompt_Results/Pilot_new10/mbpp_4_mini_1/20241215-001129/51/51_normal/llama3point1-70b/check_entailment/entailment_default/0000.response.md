Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the average of a list of numbers. However, the output hints indicate that it incorrectly computes the average by dividing the product of all elements by the length of the list, rather than summing the elements. Therefore, when the list contains multiple elements, the result will not represent the average value of the numbers, which is contrary to the problem description. Additionally, if the list contained a zero, the product would be zero, misleading the average since the correct average should involve summing the numbers instead.

For example, for an input list of `[2, 3, 4]`, the product is 24, and the length is 3, resulting in a return value of `8.0`, while the actual average is `3.0`. This inconsistency indicates that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
