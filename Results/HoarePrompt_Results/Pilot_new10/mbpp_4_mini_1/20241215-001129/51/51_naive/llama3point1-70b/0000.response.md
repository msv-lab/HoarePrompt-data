Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case of an empty list. If `numbers` is an empty list, the calculation `product / len(numbers)` will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` since the length of the list is 0. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
