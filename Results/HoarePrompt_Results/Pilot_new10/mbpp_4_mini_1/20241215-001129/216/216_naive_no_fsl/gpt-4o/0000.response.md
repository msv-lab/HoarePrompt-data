To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we analyze the code and check for potential issues.

The problem description states that we need to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Hereâ€™s the analysis of the provided code:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True
```

**Analysis:**
1. **Empty List**: The function returns `False` for an empty list, which seems reasonable as there are no consecutive numbers in an empty list.
  
2. **Sorting**: The input list is sorted. This allows the function to check for consecutive numbers correctly by comparing each element with the next one.

3. **Consecutive Check**: The function iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers is exactly 1. If any pair is found that does not meet this requirement, the function returns `False`. If all pairs satisfy the condition, it returns `True`.

4. **Duplicates**: The function also correctly identifies that duplicates (e.g., `[1, 2, 1]`) should return `False` since they do not represent a set of unique consecutive numbers.

To evaluate the correctness, we can try some edge cases:

- **Single-element list**: The function should return `True` for lists like `[1]` or `[5]` because a single number can be considered a consecutive sequence by itself.
- **Negative numbers**: The function should work with negative numbers as well, so checking for something like `[-3, -2, -1, 0]` should return `True`.
- **Non-consecutive elements**: An input like `[1, 2, 2, 3, 5]` should return `False`, and this is also correctly handled as this list contains duplicates and gaps.
  
Testing with a single element list:
```python
assert func_1([1]) == True  # Should return True
```

After considering the aforementioned cases:
- The function handles empty lists, duplicates, single-element lists, and negative numbers effectively.
- There are no potential input scenarios mentioned that fail based on the problem description.

Given that all tested edge cases hold true, I find no failing case for the provided implementation.

**Correctness: True** 
The function properly checks for the condition of consecutive numbers in all tested scenarios.
