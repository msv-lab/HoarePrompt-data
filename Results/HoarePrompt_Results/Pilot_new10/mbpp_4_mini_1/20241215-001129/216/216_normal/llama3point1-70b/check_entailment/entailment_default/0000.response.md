The provided program aims to check whether a list contains consecutive numbers without duplicates. It first sorts the list and then checks two conditions: that each element differs from its neighbor by 1 (which is necessary for consecutive integers) and that the length of the list matches the length of the set of elements (to ensure there are no duplicates).

However, the program has a critical flaw: if the input list is empty, it evaluates to True because it does not conform to the logic of needing to find consecutive integers. According to the output hints, the function should return False for empty lists, but this logic is missing from the implementation. 

Additionally, while the function does check for duplicates and non-consecutiveness effectively, it does not handle the empty list case appropriately.

For example, with an empty input list:

```python
func_1([])  # Expected output: False (but will return True)
```

This shows that the function does not meet the problem description's criteria for *every potential case*.

Correctness: **False**.
