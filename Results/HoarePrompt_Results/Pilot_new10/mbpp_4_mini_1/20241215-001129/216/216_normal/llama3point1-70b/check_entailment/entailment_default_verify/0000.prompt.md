You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers by first sorting the list and then checking if each adjacent pair of numbers has a difference of exactly 1. However, there is a potential case where the logic fails:

1. The program assumes that the list can only contain positive integers. For instance, if the input list is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly identifies the sequence as consecutive.
2. However, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, it also returns `True` as expected.
3. However, if the input list is `[1, 2, 4]`, the logic here would also fail because it should check for pairs that include all numbers within the given range (1 to 4 in this case).
4. Similarly, an empty list `[]` or a list with a single element (like `[5]`) would incorrectly return `False` instead of considering that by default, these can be interpreted as not having any non-consecutiveness issues.

Thus, cases with gaps in the sequence or with 0 or negative numbers are not correctly handled by the program, leading to incorrect return values. So, the program does not correctly identify whether a given list contains consecutive numbers for all potential scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns True if the list contains exactly consecutive integers (e.g., [1, 2, 3] or [5, 6, 7]) without any duplicates, and False otherwise. The function also returns False for empty lists and lists that are not sorted consecutively by one. Additionally, if the list contains duplicate integers or non-consecutive integers, the return value will also be False. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
