Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for the case of negative integers correctly. For example, the input list `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]` does not consist of consecutive integers, but the function will incorrectly consider it as consecutive if such numbers are sorted in the given range. 

Furthermore, the program does not handle empty input lists properly as mentioned in the output hints that should return False. An empty list would result in `True` from the combination of the two conditions in the return statement, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Thus, there are cases where the function does not meet the expected behavior described in the problem statement, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
