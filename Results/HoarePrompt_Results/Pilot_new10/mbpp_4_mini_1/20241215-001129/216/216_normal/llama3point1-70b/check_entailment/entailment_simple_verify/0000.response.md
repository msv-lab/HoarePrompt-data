The function `func_1` is designed to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each adjacent pair of numbers is exactly 1, while also ensuring that there are no duplicates.

1. The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it may fail in several scenarios, such as with gaps in the sequence or with an empty list. However, upon further analysis:
   - The program does check for duplicates by comparing the length of the list and the length of the set of the list. This ensures that only unique values are considered.
   - The handling of gaps in the sequence is addressed by checking each adjacent pair after sorting. If there are any gaps in the range of numbers, the difference condition will fail.
   - The edge cases with empty lists or single-element lists do not contribute to incorrectly identifying whether numbers are consecutive as per the problem description; the logic only operates with the list's contents, disregarding the size in terms of non-consecutiveness since an empty list would logically be considered as not containing consecutive numbers.

Based on the annotations and the functionality described, the program accurately tests for consecutive numbers as defined in the provided description. Thus, the original assessment's claim of incorrectness does not hold in light of the specified assumptions about valid input.

Final: **True**
