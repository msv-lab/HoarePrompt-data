Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly check whether the list contains consecutive numbers, as specified in the problem description. The key issues are as follows:

1. **Handling of Empty List**: The program does not explicitly handle the case of an empty list. According to the problem description, one could argue that an empty list does not have consecutive numbers, but this isn't defined in the original problem; thus, the result could be ambiguous.

2. **Sorting and Duplicates**: The current implementation sorts the list and checks for duplicates using `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`. While this is a good practice for ensuring there are no duplicates, the check for consecutive numbers could be misleading. For example, if the list contains only one element, the conditional check `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` would return True, but `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` would not have any elements to evaluate, which leads to an inconsistency in the intended logic.

3. **Range of Values**: The check `lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1` assumes that the list should only contain consecutive integers, but it does not account for the case where integers are not starting from a consecutive sequence (e.g., [2, 3, 4] would pass, but it would not recognize if there were a gap such as [1, 3, 4]).

Overall, due to the potential cases where the function does not behave as intended—specifically with empty or single-element lists, and potential non-consecutiveness—this implementation fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.
