The variable `lst_sorted` is assigned the value of `sorted(lst)`, which sorts the list `lst` in ascending order. Since `lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` will be the same list as `lst` but in sorted order. The initial state of `lst` is preserved, but a new variable `lst_sorted` is created reflecting the sorted order of `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty; `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`.**
