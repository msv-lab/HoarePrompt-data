To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we must first consider the behavior of the loop and the constraints from the initial state.

Given:
- `lst` is a list of integers that is not empty.
- `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`.

### Analyzing the Loop:

The loop iterates from `0` to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. This means:
- If `len(lst_sorted) >= 2`, the loop will execute at least once.
- The variable `i` will take values starting from `0` up to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`.
- In each iteration, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is not equal to 1. If at any point this condition is met, the function returns `False`.

### Final Output State:

After all iterations of the loop, if the function has not returned `False`, this implies that:
- All consecutive elements in the sorted list differ by exactly 1.
- Therefore, after the loop completes:
  - `lst_sorted` remains sorted and contains all integers in a consecutive sequence.
  - The length of `lst_sorted` must be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure the loop executed.

Thus, the final output state can be succinctly expressed:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`, and all elements in `lst_sorted` form a consecutive sequence.**
