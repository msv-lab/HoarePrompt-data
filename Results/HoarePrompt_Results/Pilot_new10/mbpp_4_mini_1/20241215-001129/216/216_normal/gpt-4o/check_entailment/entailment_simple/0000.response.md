To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided function `func_1(lst)`:

### Problem Description:
The function is required to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list of integers as its input.

2. **Handling Empty List**: 
   - The function checks if the list is empty (`if (not lst):`), and if so, it returns `False`. This aligns with the requirement since an empty list cannot have consecutive numbers.

3. **Sorting the List**: 
   - The list is sorted using `sorted(lst)`, which allows us to analyze the order of the numbers. 

4. **Checking for Consecutive Numbers**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between each adjacent pair of numbers is exactly 1 (`if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:`).
   - If any difference is not equal to 1, it returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding non-consecutive numbers, it returns `True`.

### Testing Assertions:
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True`: This is correct because the numbers are consecutive.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False`: This is correct because 3 and 5 are not consecutive.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False`: This is correct because having duplicate '1' and '2' means it cannot represent a consecutive sequence.

### Conclusion:
The function does accurately assess whether the list contains consecutive integers by first sorting the list, checking for empty, and then verifying each required condition for consecutive numbers. 

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description without any exceptions. 

Correctness: **True**
