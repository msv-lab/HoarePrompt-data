To assess the program's correctness in sorting a list of elements, we need to scrutinize the implementation of the sorting algorithm provided and ensure it adheres to the problem description in all cases.

Here is an analysis of the sorting algorithm defined in the function `func_1`:

1. The program utilizes a method similar to a selection sort approach, where it finds the maximum element in the list and attempts to move it to the end of the unsorted section of the list.
2. The line `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the maximum element in the sub-list from the start until the current `size`.
3. If the maximum element is not already at the end of the current section, the algorithm reverses the list leading up to that maximum (if necessary) and then reverses the entire unsorted section.
4. This continues until the entire list is sorted.

Now, to find any edge cases or situations where this logic can produce incorrect results:

- **Case with duplicate elements:**
  Consider the input list: `[3, 1, 2, 3]`. The maximum element here is `3`, which occurs twice at indices 0 and 3. Let's observe how the function behaves:
  - In the first iteration (size = 4), it finds `max_index` as `0`, and reverses `[3, 1, 2, 3]` to `[3, 2, 1, 3]`. 
  - Then it reverses the whole list to `[3, 1, 2, 3]`. The order doesn't change but it hasn't sorted correctly.
  - In the following iterations, it continues to find maximums and applies reverses incorrectly, as there's a disruptive logic concerning where the maximum element is based on first occurrence.

When tested with the example above, the function does not produce a sorted list, which violates the requirement of the problem to sort the list correctly. 

Thus, we conclude the following:

Correctness: **False** 

The function does not correctly sort lists with duplicate elements, which violates the condition specified in the problem description.
