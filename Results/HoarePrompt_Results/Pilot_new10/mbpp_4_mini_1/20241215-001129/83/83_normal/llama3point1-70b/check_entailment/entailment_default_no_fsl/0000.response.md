Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires a function to sort a list of elements, but the implemented function is designed to sort the list in non-ascending order (i.e., from highest to lowest). The description does not specifically mention sorting in non-ascending order; it simply states to "sort a list of elements." This implies a generic sort, which typically refers to sorting in ascending order. Therefore, the function does not adhere correctly to the problem description since it alters the output's expected order.

Additionally, the function may also encounter issues when handling lists with duplicate elements, as the use of `arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` will always return the first occurrence of the maximum value, which can disrupt the sorting process depending on the list configuration.

In conclusion, since the program does not follow the description for every potential case, especially regarding the expected order of sorting, it is incorrect.
