The code assigns `max_index` to the index of the maximum value within the first `size` elements of the list `arr`. The variable `size` is equal to `n`, which is positive and greater than 0. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` from index 0 to `size - 1`.**
