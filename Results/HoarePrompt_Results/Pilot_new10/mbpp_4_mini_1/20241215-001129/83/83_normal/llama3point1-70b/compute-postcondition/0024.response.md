Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `arr` of comparable elements and sorts the list in non-ascending order, returning the sorted list. It does this using a variation of the selection sort algorithm and handles varying orderings of elements correctly. Given that it operates on a list, potential edge cases include an empty list, which the function will also return as it is, validating that the function can handle such cases gracefully. **
