According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `size`, which is initialized at `n` and decremented in each iteration until it reaches 0. At the end of the last iteration, we have `size` that reflects the current index for the loop. Given that `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, and knowing that `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, for the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be decremented by 1.

Thus, at the end of the last iteration:
- The value of `size` would be decremented to the next size.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to start, which has not changed.
- Since `max_index` cannot be 0 or `size - 1`, it will stay unchanged.

So, the loop will execute again with `size` adjusted to `size - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared; `max_index` is not equal to `size - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is decremented to the next value**.
