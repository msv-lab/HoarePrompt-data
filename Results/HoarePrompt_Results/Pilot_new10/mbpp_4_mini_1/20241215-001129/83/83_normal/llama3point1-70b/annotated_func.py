#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be compared with each other.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements that are sorted in non-ascending order, `n` is the initial length of `arr` which is a non-negative integer.
    return arr
    #The program returns the list 'arr' which is sorted in non-ascending order, with its initial length being the non-negative integer 'n'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of comparable elements and sorts the list in non-ascending order, returning the sorted list. It does this using a variation of the selection sort algorithm and handles varying orderings of elements correctly. Given that it operates on a list, potential edge cases include an empty list, which the function will also return as it is, validating that the function can handle such cases gracefully.
