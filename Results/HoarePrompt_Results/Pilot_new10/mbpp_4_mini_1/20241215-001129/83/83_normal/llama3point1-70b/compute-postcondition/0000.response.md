`n` is assigned the value of `len(arr)`, which computes the number of elements in the list `arr`. The value of `n` will be a non-negative integer corresponding to the count of elements in `arr`. The state of the other variable, `arr`, remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared with each other; `n` is the non-negative integer equal to the length of `arr`.**
