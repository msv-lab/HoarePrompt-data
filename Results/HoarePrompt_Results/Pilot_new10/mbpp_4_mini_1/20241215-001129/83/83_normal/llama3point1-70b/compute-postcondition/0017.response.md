The code modifies a portion of the `arr` list by reversing the elements up to the index of `max_index`. The value of `max_index` is the index of the first element of `arr`, so `arr[:max_index + 1]` will include at least the first element because `max_index` starts from 0. The contents of the array up to that index are reversed in their order, while the rest of the state remains unchanged.

Thus, the Output State will reflect that `arr` has been modified but will not specify the values inside `arr`, as they can vary depending on the initial contents.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `max_index` is the index of the first element of `arr`, `n` remains greater than 0, `size` is 1, and `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed.**
