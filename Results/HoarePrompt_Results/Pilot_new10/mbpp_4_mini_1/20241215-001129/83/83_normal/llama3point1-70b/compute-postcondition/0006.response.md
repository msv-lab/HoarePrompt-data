Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` from index 0 to `size - 1`. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, then the elements of `arr` from index 0 to `max_index` are reversed, while `max_index` remains not equal to `size - 1` and not equal to 0.***
