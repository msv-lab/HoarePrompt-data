The provided code snippet reverses a portion of the list `arr` from the start to the index `max_index`, inclusive. Given the current state, `max_index` points to an index that is not at the start or the end of the list, which means that the reversal will change the order of the elements from index 0 to `max_index`.

Since `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `arr[:max_index + 1]` corresponds to the sublist from the beginning of the list up to and including the item at `max_index`. This sublist will be reversed, while the remainder of the list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` has elements from index 0 to `max_index` reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` from index 0 to `size - 1`, and the `max_index` is still not equal to `size - 1` and not equal to 0.**
