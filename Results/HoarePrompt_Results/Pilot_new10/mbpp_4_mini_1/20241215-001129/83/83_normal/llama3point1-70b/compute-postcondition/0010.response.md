`max_index` is assigned the index of the maximum value in the list `arr` from the beginning of the list up to `size`. Since `size` has been decremented and is greater than 0, this means that `max_index` will point to the index of the maximum element within the first `size` elements of `arr`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared; `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is decremented to the next value.**
