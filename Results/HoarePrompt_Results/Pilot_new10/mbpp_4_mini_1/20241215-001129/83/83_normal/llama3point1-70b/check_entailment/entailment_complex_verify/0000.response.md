The original assessment marked the program as incorrect, citing issues with index retrieval, reverse logic, and edge cases. However, the annotated version of the code clarifies that the program indeed sorts the list in non-ascending order. The assessment fails to consider the intended outcome of sorting the list correctly, as the function implements a valid selection sort-like approach, albeit reversing segments rather than performing direct comparisons.

Here are the reasonings based on the annotated version:

1. **Index Retrieval**: While it is true that the line `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` could return the first occurrence of duplicates, the problem statement only requires a sorted list (in non-ascending order), which this implementation will achieve regardless of duplicate placements.

2. **Reverse Logic**: The reversal method used here is a valid approach to reposition elements correctly in the context of the algorithm. The algorithm, in essence, sorts the array as intended, potentially in an unconventional way, but it achieves the required sorted outcome.

3. **Edge Cases**: The annotated code indicates that the function will return the input list as is when it is empty. This behavior is indeed appropriate per the problem requirements.

Given these observations, I conclude that the program does meet the requirements of sorting the input list correctly, even considering the unconventional method of achieving this. The initial assessment is not accurate.

Thus, the final correctness assessment is:

Final: **True**.
