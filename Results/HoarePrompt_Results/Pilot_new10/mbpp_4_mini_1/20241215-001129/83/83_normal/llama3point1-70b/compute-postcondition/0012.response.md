Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared. If `max_index` is not equal to 0, then the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are reversed. Additionally, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`, `n` is greater than 0, and `size` has been decremented to the next value.***
