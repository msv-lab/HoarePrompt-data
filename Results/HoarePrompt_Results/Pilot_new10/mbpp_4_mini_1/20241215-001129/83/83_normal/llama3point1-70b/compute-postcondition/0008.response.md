Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, then `arr` is the reversed version of the elements from index 0 to `size - 1`, with `n` greater than 0 and `max_index` indicating the index of the maximum value in the original `arr` without being 0 or `size - 1`.***
