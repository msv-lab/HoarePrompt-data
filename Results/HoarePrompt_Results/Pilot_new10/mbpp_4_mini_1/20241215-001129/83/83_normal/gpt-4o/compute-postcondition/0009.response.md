The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 3. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 3, `max_index` is 0, and `i` is 3. After the assignment, the value of `max_index` changes from 0 to 3, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `max_index` is 3, `i` is 3**
