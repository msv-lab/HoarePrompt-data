You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Annotated Functions:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements of any type sorted in decreasing order, `n` is 1 (as the loop will stop when curr_size becomes less than or equal to 1), and `curr_size` has been decremented from the original length of `arr` down to 1.
    return arr
    #The program returns the list 'arr' which is sorted in decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of elements of any type and sorts it in decreasing order using a sorting algorithm that involves flipping elements based on their indices. The function returns the sorted list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer such that end < len(arr), and start is initialized to 0.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to `end`, `end` is reduced to an initial value minus the number of times the loop executed, and the array `arr` has had its elements reversed between indices 0 and the original value of `end`. If `end` was originally greater than `start`, the loop executed fully, swapping elements until the middle of the array was reached. If `end` was not greater than `start`, the loop did not execute, and the array remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `end` (less than the length of the global list `arr`) and reverses the elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `end`. If `end` is 0, the function does not modify the array as there are no elements to swap. The function does not return anything, as it directly modifies the list `arr` in place.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the list arr, which must be defined in the scope of the function.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return max_index
    #The program returns the value of 'max_index', which represents the index of the maximum element in a given list or dataset.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, and returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`. It does not handle cases where `arr` is empty or when `n` is 0, potentially leading to incorrect results. If all elements are equal, it will return 0.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
