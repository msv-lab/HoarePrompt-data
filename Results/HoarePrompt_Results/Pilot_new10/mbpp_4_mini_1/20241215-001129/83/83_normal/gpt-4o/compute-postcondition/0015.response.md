Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `end` (less than the length of the global list `arr`) and reverses the elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `end`. If `end` is 0, the function does not modify the array as there are no elements to swap. The function does not return anything, as it directly modifies the list `arr` in place. **
