Final: **False**

The original assessment stated the program was incorrect due to several issues, including the use of global variables and incorrect function calls. However, based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` properly sorts the list in decreasing order when the relevant global list `arr` is defined and assumes that input is valid.

While the global variable usage in `find_max_index` and `flip` could be seen as poor practice, as long as `arr` is defined correctly in the scope the program runs, it does allow the program to function as intended. Additionally, the sorting logic itself is sound in concept, performing the pancake sort by finding the maximum and flipping.

The main issue is that it does not sort in increasing order as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program does successfully sort the list but does so in the wrong order, which marginally deviates from the intent outlined in the problem description. However, the program does not result in execution errors, so interpreting it as "incorrect" in the context may not fully represent its functionality.

Thus, while the program sorts correctly based on its own logic, it does not solve the problem as described, leading me to ultimately declare it incorrect in the context of what it was expected to achieve overall.
