You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr

def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1

def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is intended to sort a list of elements, but it has several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly.

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The `find_max_index` function references the variable `arr`, but `arr` is not defined in that function. This will result in a `NameError`. Each function should communicate its dependencies explicitly, especially when arrays or lists are needed.

2. **The `flip` Function**: The `flip` function is meant to reverse a section of the list, but it doesn't take the list itself as a parameter. As a result, it lacks context about which list it is supposed to modify.

3. **Sorting Logic**: The logic implemented in `func_1` seems to follow a pancake sorting approach, where it finds the maximum element in the remaining unsorted portion and flips it to the front, then flips it again to move that maximum to the end. However, due to the issues above, this logic cannot function as intended.

Given these mistakes, the program will not sort the provided lists correctly and will fail to execute entirely. A specific case that fails is the use of `func_1` itself since the required array `arr` is never passed to the functions, causing the program to break. 

Thus, due to these issues, the program does not satisfy the requirements of sorting a list of elements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `arr` of elements of any type and sorts it in decreasing order using a sorting algorithm that involves flipping elements based on their indices. The function returns the sorted list. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a non-negative integer `end` (less than the length of the global list `arr`) and reverses the elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `end`. If `end` is 0, the function does not modify the array as there are no elements to swap. The function does not return anything, as it directly modifies the list `arr` in place. 

Output hint for function_3: The function accepts a positive integer `n`, and returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`. It does not handle cases where `arr` is empty or when `n` is 0, potentially leading to incorrect results. If all elements are equal, it will return 0. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
