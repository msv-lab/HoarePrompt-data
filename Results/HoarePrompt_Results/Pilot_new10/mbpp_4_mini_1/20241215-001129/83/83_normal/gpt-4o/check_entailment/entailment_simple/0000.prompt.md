You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements of any type sorted in decreasing order, `n` is 1 (as the loop will stop when curr_size becomes less than or equal to 1), and `curr_size` has been decremented from the original length of `arr` down to 1.
    return arr
    #The program returns the list 'arr' which is sorted in decreasing order.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer such that end < len(arr), and start is initialized to 0.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to `end`, `end` is reduced to an initial value minus the number of times the loop executed, and the array `arr` has had its elements reversed between indices 0 and the original value of `end`. If `end` was originally greater than `start`, the loop executed fully, swapping elements until the middle of the array was reached. If `end` was not greater than `start`, the loop did not execute, and the array remains unchanged.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the list arr, which must be defined in the scope of the function.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return max_index
    #The program returns the value of 'max_index', which represents the index of the maximum element in a given list or dataset.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
