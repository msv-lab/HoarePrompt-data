The variable `max_index` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and that `arr` must be defined in the scope of the function, but no specific changes occur regarding `n` or `arr`. Therefore, the output state only needs to reflect the updated value of `max_index`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `arr`, `max_index` is 0**.
