Final: **False**. 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program has significant issues preventing it from functioning correctly. Specifically, the use of global variables and the lack of list parameter passing lead to a `NameError`. Additionally, the sorting logic relies on these problematic implementations. The output hints do not alleviate these concerns as they further confirm the reliance on the non-passable global variable `arr`, which leads to incorrect functionality. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of sorting a list of elements and will not execute as intended.
