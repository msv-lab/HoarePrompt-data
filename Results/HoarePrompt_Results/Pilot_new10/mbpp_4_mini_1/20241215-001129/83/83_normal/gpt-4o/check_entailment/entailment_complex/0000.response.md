Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly fulfill the problem description, which is to sort a list of elements in ascending order. According to the annotations, the function `func_1` is implemented to sort the list in decreasing order. This directly contradicts the requirement to sort the list. 

Furthermore, the function `find_max_index`, which is used to find the maximum index in the array, does not include handling for cases where the array may be empty or where its length (`n`) is `0`, leading to potential index errors. 

For example, if `func_1` is called with an empty list `[]`, the function will still invoke `find_max_index(0)`, which will lead to erroneous behavior, as the index `0` will not be valid for an empty list, ultimately causing an index error.

In conclusion, since the function does not sort the list in the required order in all cases and also fails to handle edge cases appropriately, I declare the correctness of the program to be false.
