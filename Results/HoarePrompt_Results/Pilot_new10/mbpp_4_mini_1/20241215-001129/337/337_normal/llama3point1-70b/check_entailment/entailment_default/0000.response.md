Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given function correctly finds the sum of non-repeated elements in the input list `lst`. The function uses a generator expression that iterates through each element `i` in the list, checking if `lst.count(i) == 1`, which means it only includes elements that appear exactly once in the list. The use of `sum()` will then accumulate these values. According to the output hints, if no unique integers exist or if the list is empty, the function will return 0, which aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the code functions correctly for all potential cases outlined in the description.
