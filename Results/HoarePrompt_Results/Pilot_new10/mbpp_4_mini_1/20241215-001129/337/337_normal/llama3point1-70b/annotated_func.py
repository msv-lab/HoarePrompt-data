#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of all integers in the list that appear exactly once. If all integers appear more than once or if the list is empty, the function will return 0, as there are no unique integers to sum.
