Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list `lst`. 

Here's how and why it satisfies the problem description:

1. **Identifying Non-repeated Elements**: The program uses a generator expression to iterate through each element `i` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks whether it appears exactly once in the list using `lst.count(i) == 1`.

2. **Calculating the Sum**: It then sums (using the `sum` function) all of those elements that meet the condition of being non-repeated. 

3. **General Case Handling**: The use of `count` adequately handles cases where different elements may appear multiple times in the list. The program ensures that only those elements that appear exactly once contribute to the total sum, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to sum non-repeated elements.

By following this logic, the program fulfills the problem's requirement for any expected input cases, therefore it is correct.
