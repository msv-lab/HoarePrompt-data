You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements:

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

### Logic of the Program:
1. The program uses a generator expression to traverse through each element `i` in the list `lst`.
2. It checks if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1, which indicates that `i` is a non-repeated element.
3. It sums up all such non-repeated elements and returns the result.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: For an input of `[]`, the output should be `0` since there are no elements to sum.
2. **All Elements Repeated**: For an input like `[1, 1, 1]`, the output should be `0` since there are no non-repeated elements.
3. **Single Element List**: For input `[5]`, the output should be `5` since `5` is a non-repeated element.
4. **Mixed List**: For a list like `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the output should be `3` since `3` is the only non-repeated element.
5. **Negative and Positive Numbers**: For a list like `[-1, -2, -2, 1, 1, 2]`, the output should be `-1` since `-1` is the only non-repeated element.

### Performance Consideration:
Using `lst.count(i)` within a loop leads to a time complexity of O(n^2), which could be inefficient for very large lists.

### Test Cases:
- For `func_1([])`, it should return `0` (correct).
- For `func_1([1, 1, 1])`, it should return `0` (correct).
- For `func_1([5])`, it should return `5` (correct).
- For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])`, it should return `3` (correct).
- For `func_1([-1, -2, -2, 1, 1, 2])`, it should return `-1` (correct).

After examining these potential cases, the program produces the expected results in each situation listed. Therefore, it doesn't fail in any test cases observed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly sums the non-repeated elements of a list, handling all tested cases according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of all integers in the list that appear exactly once. If all integers appear more than once or if the list is empty, the function will return 0, as there are no unique integers to sum.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
