Based on the problem description, the program correctly implements the function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The generator expression inside the `sum()` function correctly checks for elements that occur only once in the list and calculates their sum. 

The original assessment accurately pointed out the function's logic, potential edge cases, performance considerations, and concluded that the program is correct. Moreover, the annotated version reinforces this understanding by clearly stating that the function returns the sum of integers that appear exactly once, thus aligning with the requirements of the problem description.

Since both the original assessment and the annotated version of the code confirm that the program fulfills the problem's requirements and handles the specified edge cases correctly, the assessment remains accurate.

Final: **True**
