Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The problem requires finding the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list. However, the implementation in `func_1` uses `sum(set(lst))`, which calculates the sum of all unique elements in the list, rather than strictly the non-repeated ones. 

For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum to `20`. But the function would return `21` because it includes the unique value `1` as well. 

Thus, the program does not meet the problem's requirement, leading to an incorrect result. The annotated version confirms that the function sums unique integers, aligning with the initial assessment's conclusion of incorrectness regarding the requirement.
