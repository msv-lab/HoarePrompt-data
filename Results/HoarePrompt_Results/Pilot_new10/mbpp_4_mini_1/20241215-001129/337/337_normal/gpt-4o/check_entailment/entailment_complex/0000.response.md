The provided program is intended to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list, as described in the problem description. However, let's analyze how the function works:

1. The function takes a list of integers `lst`.
2. It converts the list to a set using `set(lst)`. This operation removes any duplicate elements from the list, leaving only unique elements.
3. It then computes the sum of these unique elements using `sum(set(lst))`.

Given the problem description specifies the need to find the sum of non-repeated elements, we need to differentiate between "unique" (the elements that appear at least once) and "non-repeated" (the elements that appear exactly once) in the list.

The current implementation outputs the sum of all unique elements (i.e., it includes numbers that appear more than once in the original list). As a result, it fails to adhere strictly to the problem requirement of summing only the elements that are not repeated.

For example, in the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the unique elements (as computed by the function) would be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, which sums to `21`. However, the non-repeated elements should be evaluated first, with `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6` being the only non-repeated elements, which sum to `20`. Hence, the function gives a result that is not aligning with the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements.

Correctness: **False**
