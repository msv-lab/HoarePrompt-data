Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided implementation of `func_1` does not fulfill the requirement to sum only non-repeated elements. Instead, it sums all unique elements (those that appear at least once) by converting the list to a set. This leads to incorrect results when there are duplicates in the input list.

For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the element `1` is repeated, and thus should not contribute to the sum. Instead, the correct sum for this list would be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`, not `21` as returned by the program. The output hint reiterates that the function returns the sum of all unique integers, which is misleading in the context of the problem description that specifically asks for the sum of non-repeated elements. Thus, the original assessment identifying the program as incorrect stands valid.
