Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for the sum of non-repeated elements, which means we should only include elements that appear exactly once in the list when calculating the sum. The program, however, uses `sum(set(lst))`, which sums all unique elements—those that appear at least once—rather than those that appear only once.

For example:
- In the case of the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, summing to `20`, but the program calculates `21` by summing all unique elements including `1`.

Thus, the original assessment is indeed correct, as the program does not provide the expected functionality as described in the problem statement.
