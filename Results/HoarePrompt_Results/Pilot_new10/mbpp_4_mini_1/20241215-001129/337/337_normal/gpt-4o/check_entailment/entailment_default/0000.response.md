The provided program is supposed to sum only the non-repeated (unique) elements in a list. 

The implementation of the function `func_1(lst)` creates a set from the input list `lst`, which removes duplicated elements naturally as sets can only contain unique elements. The function then sums these unique elements.

Let's evaluate the correctness of the program:

1. **Correct Functionality**: 
    - The function is defined to return the sum of non-repeated elements, and using `set(lst)` effectively achieves that by eliminating any duplicates.
  
2. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided:
    - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` results in a sum of `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6`, which correctly equals `20`, but it's provided as `21` in the assertion, suggesting a mismatch.
    - `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` results in a sum of `1 + 2 + 9 + 45 = 57`, but it's expected to return `71` which is incorrect.
    - `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` results in a sum of `12 + 9 + 2 = 23`, while expecting `78`.

3. **Output Hints**: The output hints state that it returns the sum of unique integers and mentions that if the list is empty, it returns 0. However, the function does not handle repeated elements correctly in the context of calculating the sum of truly unique elements, as the problem description implies it should only count numbers that appear exactly once in the list.

From this detailed examination, we can see that the program is incorrect:

- The function does not accurately calculate the sum of non-repeated elements (i.e., elements that appear exactly once).
- The assertion results provided do not match the expected outcomes based on the summation of unique values only.
- All assertions in the sample cases are fundamentally flawed as they expect incorrect sums.

Thus, the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion.

Correctness: **False**.
