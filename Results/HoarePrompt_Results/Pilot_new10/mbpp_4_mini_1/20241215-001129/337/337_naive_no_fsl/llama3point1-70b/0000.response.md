To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements:

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))
```

### Logic of the Program:
1. The program uses a generator expression to traverse through each element `i` in the list `lst`.
2. It checks if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1, which indicates that `i` is a non-repeated element.
3. It sums up all such non-repeated elements and returns the result.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: For an input of `[]`, the output should be `0` since there are no elements to sum.
2. **All Elements Repeated**: For an input like `[1, 1, 1]`, the output should be `0` since there are no non-repeated elements.
3. **Single Element List**: For input `[5]`, the output should be `5` since `5` is a non-repeated element.
4. **Mixed List**: For a list like `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the output should be `3` since `3` is the only non-repeated element.
5. **Negative and Positive Numbers**: For a list like `[-1, -2, -2, 1, 1, 2]`, the output should be `-1` since `-1` is the only non-repeated element.

### Performance Consideration:
Using `lst.count(i)` within a loop leads to a time complexity of O(n^2), which could be inefficient for very large lists.

### Test Cases:
- For `func_1([])`, it should return `0` (correct).
- For `func_1([1, 1, 1])`, it should return `0` (correct).
- For `func_1([5])`, it should return `5` (correct).
- For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])`, it should return `3` (correct).
- For `func_1([-1, -2, -2, 1, 1, 2])`, it should return `-1` (correct).

After examining these potential cases, the program produces the expected results in each situation listed. Therefore, it doesn't fail in any test cases observed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly sums the non-repeated elements of a list, handling all tested cases according to the problem description.
