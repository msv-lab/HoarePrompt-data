Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list. However, the program uses `sum(set(lst))`, which sums all unique elements of the list, not just those that appear only once.

For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated elements here are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum up to `20`. However, the program would return `21` because it sums the unique elements `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` instead. 

Thus, the program fails to correctly identify and sum only the non-repeated elements, leading to an incorrect result.
