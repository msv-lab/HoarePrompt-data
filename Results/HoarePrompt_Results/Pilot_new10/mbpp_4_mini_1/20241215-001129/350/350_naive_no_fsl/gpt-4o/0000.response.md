To analyze the provided program, we need to ensure that it correctly identifies the last position of an element in a sorted array. 

Let's review the function `func_1(arr, x)`:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is supposed to find the last occurrence of the element `x` in the sorted array `arr`.
2. **Implementation Details**:
   - It iterates over the array from the last index to the first.
   - If it finds an element equal to `x`, it returns the current index.
   - If it reaches the beginning of the loop without finding `x`, it returns `-1`.

The given assertions check the following cases:
- The last position of `1` in `[1, 2, 3]` (expected output: `0`).
- The last position of `1` in `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (expected output: `2`).
- The last position of `3` in `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` (expected output: `3`).

Now, let's consider edge cases:

- **Case when `x` is not present**: For instance, `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)` should return `-1`, but we must confirm this is handled.
- **Duplicates with element not being last**: Consider `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 2)`, which should return `1`.
- **Empty list**: `func_1([], 1)` should return `-1`.

Now, let's run these edge cases through the function:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)` returns `-1` (correct).
2. `func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 2)` returns `1` (correct).
3. `func_1([], 1)` returns `-1` (correct).

After reviewing the implementation thoroughly, it appears that the function behaves as expected for all specified cases. It correctly identifies the last position of the target element, handles cases where the element is not found, manages duplicates effectively, and works with empty lists.

Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the program is accurate according to the requirements given in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
