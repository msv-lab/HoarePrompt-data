Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning and returns the index of the last occurrence of the target. If the target is not found, the function returns -1.

The logic comprehensively handles the following scenarios:
1. If the target exists multiple times in the array, the program correctly returns the index of the last occurrence.
2. If the target exists only once, it returns the index of that element.
3. If the target does not exist at all in the array, it correctly returns -1.

Since the function satisfies all potential input cases as described in the problem statement, it is considered correct.
