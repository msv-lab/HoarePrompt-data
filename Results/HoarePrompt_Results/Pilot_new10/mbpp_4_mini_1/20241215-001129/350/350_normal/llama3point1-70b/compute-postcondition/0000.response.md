According to the given code, the loop will execute as long as `len(arr) - 1` is at least 0. This means that the array should have at least one element for `i` to start from the last index. 

Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target` is an integer. The state of the variables before the loop execution needs to ensure that `i` can take valid indices of `arr`. 

To summarize:
1. `i` should start at the last index of the array, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
2. For the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 1 element, which results in `len(arr) >= 1`.

This leads us to the following state adjustments:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1` (the last index of `arr`)**
