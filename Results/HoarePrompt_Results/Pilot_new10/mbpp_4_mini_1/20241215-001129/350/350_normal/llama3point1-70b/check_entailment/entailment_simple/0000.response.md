Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to find the last position of a given element (target) in a sorted array (arr). 

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Looping from the End**: The program iterates through the array in reverse order, starting from the last index (len(arr) - 1) down to the first index (0). This ensures that if the target appears multiple times in the array, the program will always return the index of its last occurrence.

2. **Comparison**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the current element (arr[i]) is equal to the target. If it finds a match, it immediately returns the index (i).

3. **Handling Absence of Target**: If the loop completes without finding the target, the program correctly returns -1, indicating that the target integer is not present in the array.

4. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case (when the target is not present or is at the beginning of the array) and O(1) in the best case (when the target is found right away).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program properly handles edge cases, such as an empty array (arr) and situations where the target does not exist in the array, by returning -1 as specified.

Since the function meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description without exceptions, the assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
