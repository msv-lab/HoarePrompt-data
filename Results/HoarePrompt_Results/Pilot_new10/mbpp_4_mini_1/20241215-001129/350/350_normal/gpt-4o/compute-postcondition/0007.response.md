According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` in relation to the length of `arr`. Currently, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`, meaning that it points to the second-to-last element of the array. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 in the upcoming iteration. 

The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `arr` must have at least 2 elements and that the current index `i` is `len(arr) - 2`. Since the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`, the loop should check the element at index `i - 1` (which will be `len(arr) - 3`). 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be  `len(arr) - 3`, and the loop should ensure that `arr` still has at least 3 elements to continue the iteration. 

State: **`arr` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 3`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`**
