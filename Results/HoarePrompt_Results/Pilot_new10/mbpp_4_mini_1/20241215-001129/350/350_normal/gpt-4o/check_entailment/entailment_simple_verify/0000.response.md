Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of the element `x` in the sorted array `arr`. It iterates from the end of the list to the start, effectively ensuring that it finds the last occurrence of `x`. The annotated version explains the states of the program before the function call and after the loop execution accurately, confirming that the return value will be the index of `x` if found, or `-1` otherwise. Since the assertions demonstrate the expected behavior for various scenarios, and the function correctly adheres to the problem description's requirements, the assessment of the program's correctness remains valid.
