According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). The loop can execute again if `i` can decrease, meaning that `i` must still be greater than `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, and we know that `arr` must have at least 1 element. This indicates that the minimum value for `len(arr)` is 1, so `i` is at least 0 if we consider the case of one element.

However, since the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`, it has already been checked in the loop condition. After this iteration, `i` would be decreased by 1 to `len(arr) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need `i` to equal at least `0`, so we need to ensure `arr` still has at least 1 element next time as well, since it has at least 2 elements for `i` to decrement.

At this point, we can summarize:
- The last value of `i` should be `len(arr) - 2` for the loop to execute again.
- `arr` still needs to have at least 1 element next time and therefore it should have at least 1 more element than `i`.

State: **`arr` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`**.
