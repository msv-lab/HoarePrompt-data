Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted list `arr` by iterating from the end to the beginning. The function indeed handles various scenarios as outlined in the problem description and the assertions provided. 

Moreover, the output hints indicate that the function efficiently searches the list and returns the correct index or `-1` when the element is not found. Since the program works as intended based on the problem description and handles all outlined scenarios correctly, the final assessment confirms the program's correctness.
