Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the last position of a given element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The assertions provided as test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for multiple scenarios. The annotations describe the state of the program accurately at key points, confirming that the function proceeds correctly through its logic, returning the expected indices or `-1` when necessary.

The function handles the specified problem effectively by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning and checks if the current element matches `x`, ensuring it finds the last occurrence. Additionally, the annotations clarify that the function is designed for valid inputs which conform to the problem requirements. Thus, there are no edge cases violating the functionality expected from the problem description.
