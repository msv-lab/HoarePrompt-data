The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `x`. The parameter `arr` is a list of sorted integers, and the parameter `x` is an integer. 

After executing the function body, the following outputs can be returned based on the conditions:

- **Case 1**: If the last element of `arr` is equal to `x`, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, indicating the position of the last element in the list.
  
- **Case 2**: If `arr` has at least 2 elements and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 2`.

- **Case 3**: If `arr` has at least 3 elements, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 3`.

- **Case 4**: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns -1, indicating that the value `x` is not present in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `x`, then return the index of a specific position based on the value of `x` relative to the sorted list or -1 if `x` is not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `x`, returning the index of `x`'s position based on specific conditions or -1 if `x` is not in `arr`.**
