Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function converts the number to a string to determine the length (number of digits) and then iteratively calculates the sum of each digit raised to this power. Finally, it returns whether this sum is equal to the original number, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. The function successfully handles all cases for validating Armstrong numbers, thus justifying a correctness of True.
