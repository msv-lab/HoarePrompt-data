Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether a given non-negative integer `n` is an Armstrong number. It converts the number to a string to find its digits and calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. The function returns `True` if this calculated sum equals `n` and `False` otherwise. This includes handling single-digit numbers, which are always Armstrong numbers. The provided tests with `153`, `259`, and `4458` confirm this behavior. Thus, the code meets the requirements as stated in the problem description for all potential cases.
