Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(n)` accepts a non-negative integer `n`, as stated in the precondition.
  
2. **String Conversion**: It converts the integer `n` to a string (`num_str = str(n)`) to facilitate iteration over each digit.

3. **Length Calculation**: The number of digits in `n` is calculated (`num_len = len(num_str)`), which is necessary for the Armstrong check.

4. **Armstrong Sum Calculation**: It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits (`armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)`).

5. **Comparison**: Finally, it checks if this computed sum is equal to the original number (`return armstrong_sum == n`).

The assertions given in the annotated program test this function with known Armstrong and non-Armstrong numbers:

- `func_1(153)` returns `True` since 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153.
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` since 2³ + 5³ + 9³ ≠ 259.
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False` since 4⁴ + 4⁴ + 5⁴ + 8⁴ ≠ 4458.

The program accurately checks for Armstrong numbers as defined in the problem description. It handles all relevant cases correctly, ensuring that the solution is both complete and works for all potential inputs according to the description. Thus, it adheres strictly to the given requirements.
