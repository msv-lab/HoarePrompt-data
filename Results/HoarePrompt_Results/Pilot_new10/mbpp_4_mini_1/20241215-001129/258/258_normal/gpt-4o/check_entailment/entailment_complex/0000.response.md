Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to check if a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number. 

Hereâ€™s why the program follows what the problem description states:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is considered an Armstrong number because:
   - It has 3 digits (1, 5, 3).
   - \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\).

2. **The Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` converts the input number `n` into a string to easily iterate over its digits.
   - It calculates the number of digits (`num_len`) by finding the length of the string form of `n`.
   - It computes the Armstrong sum by iterating over each digit (converted back to an integer), raising each digit to the power of `num_len`, and summing these values.
   - Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to the original number `n` and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

3. **Correctness in Handling Cases**:
   - The function accounts for all potential non-negative integers, including single-digit numbers, which will always evaluate to true since any single digit \(d\) satisfies \(d^1 = d\).
   - The assertions provided in the comments test various cases, confirming that the function works correctly on both Armstrong and non-Armstrong numbers.

No scenario from the problem description has been overlooked, and the program handles the task as specified. Therefore, it is correct and adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description.
