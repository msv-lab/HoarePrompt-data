The variable `armstrong_sum` is assigned the value computed from summing each digit of `num_str`, converted to an integer and raised to the power of `num_len`, which is the number of digits in `n`. The initial conditions specify that `n` is a non-negative integer, so `num_str` is its string representation with a length of `num_len`. 

The specific value of `armstrong_sum` will be calculated based on the digits of `num_str` and the value of `num_len`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`; `armstrong_sum` is equal to the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
