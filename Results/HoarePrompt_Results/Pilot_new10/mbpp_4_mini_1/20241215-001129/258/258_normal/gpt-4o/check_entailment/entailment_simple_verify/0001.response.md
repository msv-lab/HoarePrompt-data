Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the Armstrong number logic as described in the problem statement. The annotated version of the code confirms that before calling the function, `n` is treated as a non-negative integer, and the function dynamically calculates whether the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits equals the original number.

The examples provided in the assertions validate this logic:
- For `153`, the computation confirms it is an Armstrong number.
- For `259` and `4458`, the function returns `False` for both cases, confirming they are indeed not Armstrong numbers.

All of this supports the conclusion that the program fulfills the requirements for checking Armstrong numbers correctly.
