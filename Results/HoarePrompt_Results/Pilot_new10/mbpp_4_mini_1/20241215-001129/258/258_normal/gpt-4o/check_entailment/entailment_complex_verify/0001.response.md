Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number according to the definition provided in the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` properly handles the input, which is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer. 

The provided assertions verify the function's correctness:
- For `153`, the calculation of \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\) equals 153, which returns `True`.
- For `259`, \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3\) equals 862, which correctly returns `False`.
- For `4458`, \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4\) equals 4223, which also correctly returns `False`.

Additionally, the annotated comments accurately describe the function's behavior and its correctness for processing Armstrong numbers, confirming the original assessment that the function is correct. Therefore, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem statement.
