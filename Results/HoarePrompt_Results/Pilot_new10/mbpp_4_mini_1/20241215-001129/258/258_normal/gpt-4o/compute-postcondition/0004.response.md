The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function checks whether the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n` is equal to the original non-negative integer `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and determine if it meets the criteria of being equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the total number of digits. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns whether the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n` equals `n`.**
