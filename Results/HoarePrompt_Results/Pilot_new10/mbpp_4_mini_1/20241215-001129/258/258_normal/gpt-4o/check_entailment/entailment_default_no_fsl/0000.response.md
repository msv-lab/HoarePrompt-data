Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given non-negative integer `n` is an Armstrong number. It calculates the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n` and compares this sum to `n`. The provided assertions test the function with a number known to be an Armstrong number (153) and two numbers that are not (259 and 4458), which confirms the correctness for those cases.

Additionally, the output hints clarify that the function can also handle single-digit numbers, which are always Armstrong numbers. Since no counterexamples fall outside the described behavior and all potential cases (including the assertion checks) return the expected results, the implementation meets the problem's requirements.
