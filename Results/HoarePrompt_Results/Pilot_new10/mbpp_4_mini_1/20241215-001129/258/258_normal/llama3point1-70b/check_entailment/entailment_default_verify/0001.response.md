Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number based on the provided problem description and the output hints. 

1. **Armstrong Number Definition**: The program adheres to the definition of an Armstrong number: the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself.

2. **Input Handling**: The function converts the integer input into a string to traverse through each digit, which is a valid approach for processing non-negative integers.

3. **Calculation Logic**: 
   - The calculation process is accurately defined with the number of digits being counted and each digit being raised to the power of that count.
   - It returns `True` if the calculated sum matches the original number, otherwise it returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program covers single-digit integers effectively, recognizing them correctly as Armstrong numbers.

The output hints confirm that the function is designed to accept non-negative integers and behaves as expected, reinforcing that all conditions of the problem statement are met. Therefore, there are no discrepancies between the problem description, the code, and the original assessment.
