Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic for checking whether a number is an Armstrong number. Here's how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Definition of an Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number) for a given number of digits n is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power n. 

2. **Input Handling**: The program starts by accepting a non-negative integer as input, which aligns with the problem description.

3. **String Conversion and Length Calculation**: The program converts the integer `num` into a string to iterate over its digits and calculates the length of this string to determine how many digits are in `num`. This is correctly done using `len(num_str)`.

4. **Sum Calculation**: The program initializes a sum variable and iterates over each digit in `num_str`. It converts each digit back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and accumulates this value in `sum`. This is the core calculation needed to determine if the input number is an Armstrong number.

5. **Comparison and Return**: Finally, it compares the calculated sum with the original number `num` and returns `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. This comparison is precisely what is required to determine whether the input number is an Armstrong number.

The program covers all potential cases effectively, including single-digit numbers, which are always Armstrong numbers, and multi-digit numbers, where the logic of raising to the power of the number of digits is properly applied.

Since the program correctly implements the desired functionality as specified in the problem description, it is indeed correct.
