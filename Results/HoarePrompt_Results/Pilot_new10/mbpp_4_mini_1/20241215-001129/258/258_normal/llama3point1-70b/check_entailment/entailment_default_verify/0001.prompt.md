You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number). Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Armstrong Number Definition**: An Armstrong number for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

2. **Input Handling**: The function converts the input number into a string to iterate over each digit. This allows it to correctly handle any integer input.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - It calculates the number of digits (`num_len`).
   - It correctly initializes a sum variable to accumulate the total.
   - It iterates through each digit of the number, raising each digit to the power of `num_len` and adding it to the sum.
   - Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number (`num`).

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function properly handles single-digit numbers (0-9), which are all Armstrong numbers since \(x^1 = x\).
   - It also handles multi-digit Armstrong numbers and non-Armstrong numbers accurately.

Since I could not identify any input case for which the function fails to provide the correct output, the program works as required according to the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `True` if `num` is an Armstrong number; that is, if the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the total number of digits equals `num`. If this condition is not satisfied, it returns `False`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
