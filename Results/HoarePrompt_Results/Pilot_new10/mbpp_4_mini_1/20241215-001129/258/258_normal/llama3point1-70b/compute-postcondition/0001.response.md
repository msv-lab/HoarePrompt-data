The variable `num_len` is assigned the value of the length of `num_str`. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is its string representation, meaning `num_str` can be composed of numeric characters corresponding to the digits of `num`. Therefore, the length of `num_str`, which is `num_len`, will be equal to the number of digits in `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`.**
