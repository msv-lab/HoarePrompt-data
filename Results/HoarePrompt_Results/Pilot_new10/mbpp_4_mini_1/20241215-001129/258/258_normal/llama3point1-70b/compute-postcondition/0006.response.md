The variable `sum` is updated by adding the value of `int(digit) ** num_len` to it. Given that `num` is a non-negative integer and `num_str` is its string representation, `digit` represents the next character in `num_str`, which will be converted to an integer. The length of `num_str` is equal to `num_len`, which remains unchanged. The specific calculation performed on `sum` cannot be determined without the values of `digit` and `num_len`, but the value added to `sum` is `int(digit) ** num_len`. Therefore, the overall effect is that `sum` is increased by this computed value while keeping the precondition for `num_str`, `num`, and `num_len` intact.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (â‰¥ 0), `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is at least 1, and `sum` is updated by adding `int(digit) ** num_len` to it.**
