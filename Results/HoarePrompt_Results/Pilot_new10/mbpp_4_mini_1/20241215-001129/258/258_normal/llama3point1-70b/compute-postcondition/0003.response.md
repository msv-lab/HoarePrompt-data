According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_str`. The loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of the number. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num_str` must not be an empty string, which means `num` must be at least 0 (since it is a non-negative integer, it will have a string representation of at least one character when it is 0).

At the end of the loop’s last iteration, the values of `sum` will be unchanged since it starts at 0 and the body of the loop is omitted.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `num` should be a non-negative integer (≥ 0), and the resulting `num_str` should not be empty.
- The length of the string `num_str` should match what is derived from `num`, meaning `num_len` should equal `len(num_str)`, which also must be at least 1 for the loop to iterate at least once. 

Hence, the states should be:

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (≥ 0), `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is at least 1 (equal to the length of `num_str`), `sum` is 0**
