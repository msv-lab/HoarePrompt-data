According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_str`, which is the string representation of the non-negative integer `num`. The loop iterates over each character (digit) in `num_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` has length at least 1, so it has at least one digit.

Since the loop iterates over each digit, if `num_len` is equal to the length of `num_str`, then for the loop to execute one more time, the next `digit` must be the next character in `num_str`.

If `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, then since the last digit processed was the last character in `num_str` during the last iteration, the next `digit` will be the `num_len`-th character in `num_str`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `num_len` needs to increase by 1, which won't happen unless there is a new digit added to `num_str`.
- As this context does not include adding digits, the assumption implies that `num_str` should have one more character to continue processing.

Thus, if `num_str` can be assumed to have more digits, then at the start of the next iteration:
- The `digit` is the next character in `num_str`
- The loop will be able to access this digit until it finishes processing all the digits in `num_str`.

Given this context, since we are at the end of processing the current digit, for the code to execute again, we assume we are still within the range of digits we can process.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (â‰¥ 0), `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is at least 1 (equal to the length of `num_str`), digit is the next digit in `num_str (which is the next character) that remains to be processed**
