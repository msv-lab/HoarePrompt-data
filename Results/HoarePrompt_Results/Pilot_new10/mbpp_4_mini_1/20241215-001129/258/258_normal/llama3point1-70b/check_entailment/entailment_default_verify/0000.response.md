Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly determines whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number by checking if the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the original number. The output hint confirms that the function performs this check and returns `True` or `False` accordingly. Given that the function adheres to the problem description and handles all expected cases for non-negative integers, the assessment of correctness stands as true.
