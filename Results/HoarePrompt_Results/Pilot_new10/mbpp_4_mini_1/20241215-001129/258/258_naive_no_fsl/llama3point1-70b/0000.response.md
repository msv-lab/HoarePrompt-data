Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number). Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Armstrong Number Definition**: An Armstrong number for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

2. **Input Handling**: The function converts the input number into a string to iterate over each digit. This allows it to correctly handle any integer input.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - It calculates the number of digits (`num_len`).
   - It correctly initializes a sum variable to accumulate the total.
   - It iterates through each digit of the number, raising each digit to the power of `num_len` and adding it to the sum.
   - Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number (`num`).

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function properly handles single-digit numbers (0-9), which are all Armstrong numbers since \(x^1 = x\).
   - It also handles multi-digit Armstrong numbers and non-Armstrong numbers accurately.

Since I could not identify any input case for which the function fails to provide the correct output, the program works as required according to the given problem description.
