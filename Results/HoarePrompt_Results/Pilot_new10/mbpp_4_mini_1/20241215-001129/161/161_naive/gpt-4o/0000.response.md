Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires the function to find the n-th Lucas number, while the assertions in the program do not account for n being less than 0. The Lucas numbers are defined for non-negative integers, but the function does not handle negative input, which could lead to incorrect behavior if such an input is passed. For example, calling `func_1(-1)` would not return a meaningful result, as the Lucas numbers are not defined for negative indices. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
