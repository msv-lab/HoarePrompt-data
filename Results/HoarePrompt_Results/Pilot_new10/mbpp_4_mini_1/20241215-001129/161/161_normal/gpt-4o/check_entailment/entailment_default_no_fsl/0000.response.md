Correctness: **False**

The program does not compute the n-th Lucas number correctly for all potential cases. According to the problem description, the Lucas numbers are defined as:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

However, the implementation in `func_1` incorrectly generates a Fibonacci-like sequence starting with (2, 1) instead of correctly summing the previous two Lucas numbers. In particular, the assertion `assert func_1(9) == 76` is incorrect based on the Lucas number sequence, as L(9) is actually 76, but the way the code generates the values may yield different results for some other n values.

For instance:
- `func_1(2)` should return 3 (not tested in assertions).
- `func_1(5)` should return 11, but if the Fibonacci logic erroneously processes it, the wrong output might occur for n=5.

The Fibonacci sequence and the Lucas sequence have different definitions for their starting points and construction, leading to the potential for incorrect outputs outside the indicated assertions. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description correctly for every case.
