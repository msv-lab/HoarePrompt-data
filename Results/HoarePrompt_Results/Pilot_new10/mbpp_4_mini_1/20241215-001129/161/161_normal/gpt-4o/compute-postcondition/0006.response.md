The code assigns the values 2 and 1 to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it wasn't modified by this code. Since `n` is stated to be a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, this condition remains valid. The values of `a` and `b` are updated, but other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
