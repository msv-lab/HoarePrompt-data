According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n + 1`, starting from 2 up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `_` must be increased by 1, which means it will become 3. The upper limit of the loop, `n + 1`, should be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing. Given that `n` is greater than 1, for `_` (which is now 3) to satisfy the condition, `n` must be at least 3.

Thus, we can conclude:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, _ is 3**
