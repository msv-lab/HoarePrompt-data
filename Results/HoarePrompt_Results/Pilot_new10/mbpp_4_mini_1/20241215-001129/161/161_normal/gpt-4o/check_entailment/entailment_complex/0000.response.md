Correctness: **False**

The program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description. 

The problem description specifies that the function must return the n-th Lucas number. However, the implementation provided instead calculates the n-th Fibonacci number starting from the sequence (2, 1), which does not match the definition of the Lucas numbers. The Lucas numbers are defined similarly to the Fibonacci numbers but start with 2 and 1, not 0 and 1. 

While the Lucas numbers share a recurrence relation with the Fibonacci numbers (i.e., each number is the sum of the two preceding ones), the way the program is currently structured and described leads it to produce Fibonacci numbers rather than Lucas numbers. 

For example:
- The expected 9th Lucas number is 76, which the program correctly outputs when invoked with `func_1(9)`, as mentioned in the assertions.
- However, for other values, such as `func_1(4)`, the expected output is the 4th Lucas number, which is 7—not due to the logic of the program itself but rather due to coincidentally returning the same result as the Fibonacci sequence for that specific input.

Thus, it’s clear that the function does not consistently adhere to producing Lucas numbers as required by the problem statement. This inconsistency leads to a conclusion that the implementation is incorrect regarding the problem requirements.
