The variable `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`. The initial state indicates that `a` takes the value of `b` and then `b` becomes the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`. 

Let the previous values of `a` and `b` be represented as `a_prev` and `b_prev`. Then after the execution:
- `a` becomes `b_prev`
- `b` becomes `a_prev + b_prev`

However, the specific values of `a` and `b` before the change are unknown from the provided information. Since the values rely on each other, the output state remains generic in terms of their relationship, but specifics aren't provided.

Therefore, the output state indicates that the values of `a` and `b` have been swapped with their updated formula accordingly. Other variables remain unchanged since only `a` and `b` were recalculated.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3; `_` is 3; `a` is `b_prev`; `b` is `a_prev + b_prev`**
