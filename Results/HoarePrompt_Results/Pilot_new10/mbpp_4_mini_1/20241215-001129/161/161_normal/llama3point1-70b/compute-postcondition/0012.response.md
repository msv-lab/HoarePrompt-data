To assess the impact of the code on the program, we start with the initial state: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4; `_` is 4; `a` is `b_prev`; `b` is `a_prev + b_prev`.

1. The line of code `a, b = b, a + b` swaps the values of `a` and `b` and assigns the new values based on the tuple unpacking.
2. Before the execution:
   - `a` is `b_prev`.
   - `b` is `a_prev + b_prev`.
3. After the execution:
   - The new value of `a` will equal the old value of `b` which is `a_prev + b_prev`.
   - The new value of `b` will equal the old value of `a` plus the old value of `b`, which is `b_prev + a + b` (with the recognition that `a` was initially equal to `b_prev`, thus making it `b_prev + (a_prev + b_prev)`).

Since it's specified that `_` doesn't affect these assignments, the specific values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged in this context.

Thus, we can summarize that:
- `a` becomes `a_prev + b_prev`.
- `b` becomes `a_prev + 2 * b_prev`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4; `_` is 4; `a` is `a_prev + b_prev`; `b` is `a_prev + 2 * b_prev`.**
