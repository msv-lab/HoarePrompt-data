The values of `a` and `b` are directly assigned: `a` is set to 2 and `b` is set to 1. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1**.
