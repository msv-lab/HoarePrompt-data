The provided program is intended to compute the n-th Lucas number, but there are issues with the implementation. Let's analyze the relevant details.

In the problem description, the task is to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n > 1, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

The program functionally behaves as follows:
1. If `n == 0`, it correctly returns 2.
2. If `n == 1`, it correctly returns 1.
3. For `n > 1`, however, the loop calculates values that are described as Fibonacci numbers, not Lucas numbers. The logic in the loop (using `a, b = b, a + b`) does not adhere to the user's request of calculating Lucas numbers. It actually computes the Fibonacci sequence by incorrectly iterating and updating `a` and `b`.

Like so, this last part of the code does not follow the rules for Lucas numbers and returns a Fibonacci number instead. 

Thus, based on the above examination:

Correctness: **False** 

The primary issue is that the function, while seemingly correct for base cases, does not compute the Lucas numbers correctly for values of n greater than 1.
