Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in determining that the implementation of the function does not fulfill the problem description, which requires the calculation of the n'th Lucas number. The annotations confirm that the function ultimately computes Fibonacci numbers instead, particularly after the loop where the values of `a` and `b` are updated to track the Fibonacci sequence instead of the Lucas sequence. 

Specifically, the annotations state that after the loop executes, `a` represents the (n-1)th Fibonacci number and `b` represents the nth Fibonacci number, thus confirming the original assertion that the function does not compute the Lucas numbers correctly. The function should have employed the relation specific to the Lucas numbers, but instead follows the logic for Fibonacci computations. Hence, the conclusion remains that the function does not meet the requirements as stated in the problem description.
