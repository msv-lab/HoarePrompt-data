In the given code, the statement `a, b = b, a + b` performs a simultaneous assignment to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that `a` will take the value of `b` after the assignment, and `b` will take the value of `a + b` before the assignment occurs.

The initial state indicates that the value of `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, and `_` is 2. However, the values for `a` and `b` are not provided in the initial state.

Assuming we consider that `a` and `b` are also integers where `a` is likely initialized to some value (often starting with 0 in the Fibonacci sequence context), we can state the output depending on the individual case.

However, given the information provided, we cannot derive the new states of `a` and `b` specifically without knowing their initial values. Thus, we can conclude the result in general terms.

Therefore, after executing the code, the states of the variables can be expressed as follows:

1. `a` will take the previous value of `b`.
2. `b` will take the previous value of `a + b`.

Since this description does not strictly need numerical values for `a` and `b` without more context, the output will reflect their need for assignment based on their prior values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1; `_` is 2; `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`.**
