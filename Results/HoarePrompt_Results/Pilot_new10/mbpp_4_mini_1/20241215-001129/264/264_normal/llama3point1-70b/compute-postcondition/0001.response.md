The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`. `deg` is a floating-point number that represents an angle in degrees. The function converts `deg` to radians by multiplying it with `math.pi / 180` and returns this value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a floating-point number `deg` and return its equivalent value in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter deg, a floating-point number representing an angle in degrees, and returns the value of deg converted to radians.**
