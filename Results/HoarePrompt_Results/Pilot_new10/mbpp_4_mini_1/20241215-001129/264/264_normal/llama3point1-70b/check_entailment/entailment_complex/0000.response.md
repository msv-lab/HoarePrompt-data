Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to convert degrees to radians. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `deg`, which is appropriately described as a floating-point number representing an angle in degrees.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The formula used to convert degrees to radians is accurate. The conversion from degrees to radians is given by the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The implementation uses `math.pi`, which provides a precise value of Ï€, ensuring accurate conversion.

3. **Output**: The function returns the calculated radian value, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description.

4. **No Error Handling Specification**: While the annotated program notes that the function does not handle negative values or overflow cases, this is not a contradiction to the problem description. The description solely requires a conversion from degrees to radians, which the function accomplishes correctly for any valid floating-point input.

Therefore, as the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description without raising errors for valid inputs, it is correct.
