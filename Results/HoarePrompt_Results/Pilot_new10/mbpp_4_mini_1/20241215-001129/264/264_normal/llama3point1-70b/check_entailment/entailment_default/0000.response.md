The given program converts degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * (Ï€ / 180)`. The output hints state that the function handles valid floating-point numbers but does not handle negative values or any angle that may result in overflow.

In this case, the problem description does not specify any restrictions on the input angle (like whether it should be positive or negative), which implies that the function should work for any valid floating-point number. However, since the output hints mention that the function does not handle negative values, this indicates an oversight in the program's logic. For example, an input of `-90` degrees would yield `-1.5707963267948966` radians, which should still be a valid conversion, but the function does not explicitly account for negative degrees if interpreted differently.

Since the program does not correctly handle all potential inputs as inferred from the problem description, this makes it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
