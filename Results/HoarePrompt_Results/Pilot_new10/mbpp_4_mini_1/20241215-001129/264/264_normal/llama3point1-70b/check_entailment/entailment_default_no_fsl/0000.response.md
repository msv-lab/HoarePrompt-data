Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle negative values as stated in the output hints. For example, an input of `-180` degrees should convert to `-Ï€` radians, but the function does not account for this case and simply performs the conversion without any validation or adjustment for negative angles. Thus, there is a scenario where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
