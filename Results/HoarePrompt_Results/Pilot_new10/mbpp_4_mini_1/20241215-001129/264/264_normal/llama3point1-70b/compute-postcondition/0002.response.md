Functionality: **The function accepts a floating-point number `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent value in radians by multiplying it with `math.pi/180`. The function does not handle negative values or any angle input that may result in an overflow, but it converts any valid floating-point number without raising errors.**
