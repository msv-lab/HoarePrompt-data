Final: **False** 

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect due to the placement of the assertions before the function definition, which would lead to a `NameError`. However, the annotated version shows that the assertions are indeed tested against the function `func_1`, which correctly defines the function before any call to it can be made if we consider the code has been executed in an interactive Python environment where functions can be defined and called regardless of their order. This observation would indicate that the program as it stands functions correctly when valid input is given, producing expected results for valid degrees. Hence, the reasoning of the original assessment is not accurate given the context provided.
