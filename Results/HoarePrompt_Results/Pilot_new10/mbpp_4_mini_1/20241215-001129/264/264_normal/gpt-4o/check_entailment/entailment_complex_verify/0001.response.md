Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotated version confirms that the function successfully handles the calculation for any numeric input representing degrees, including negative angles and non-integer values, without any assumptions that would contradict the problem description.   

The assertions validate specific known values for degrees, and the program matches those expected outputs, confirming its correctness. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, supporting the conclusion that it is correct.
