Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. The problem specifically asks for a function that counts the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple. However, the implementation is flawed because it does not return a count of occurrences for each individual element; instead, it sums these counts.

For example, if we have a tuple `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and a list `lst = [2, 1]`, the correct counts should return the individual occurrences: 
- `1` appears **1** time,
- `2` appears **2** times.

The correct output format should be a list or a dictionary showing these counts, rather than a single integer that sums occurrences together.

In conclusion, the function does not fulfill the requirement to count occurrences for each element independently. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
