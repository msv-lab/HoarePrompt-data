You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2

def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly counts the occurrences of all specified elements from the given list in the provided tuple. The function `func_1` implements this by summing the counts of each element listed in `elements` within `tup`. 

The provided test cases confirm its correctness:
1. In the first test case, it counts the occurrences of 'a' (2 times) and 'b' (1 time) in the tuple, resulting in a total of 3.
2. In the second test case, it counts '1' (3 times), '4' (2 times), and '7' (1 time), for a total of 6.
3. In the third test case, it counts '1' (1 time) and '2' (1 time), resulting in a total of 2.

This implementation captures all potential cases based on the problem description and handles both tuples of strings and integers as outlined. Since I can't find any potential case where the program does not meet the requirements, it is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elements is a list of elements.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns the total occurrences of elements from 'elements' in the tuple 'tup'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
