Based on the provided problem description, the function `func_1`, and the original assessment, the analysis appears to align with the expected behavior of the code. The function accurately counts the occurrences of specified elements from a list in a tuple.

The annotations confirm the structure and logic of the function, indicating that it correctly iterates over the elements, uses tuple counting, and sums the results. The original assessment noted that the function works correctly with typical inputs and accounts for scenarios like empty lists without needing explicit checks.

However, the original assessment also pointed out a potential limitation regarding the comparison of complex data types like dictionaries or lists. While this assertion is valid, it seems irrelevant given that the problem description does not specify handling for complex data structures, nor does it declare that the input would include them. The assumption made in the assessment that inputs would be valid remains a cornerstone for evaluating correctness in this task.

Considering all of this, the function meets the specifications of the problem description, and given that the potential issue with complex types falls outside the stated function requirements and assumptions about the input, the original assessment remains valid.

Final: **True**
