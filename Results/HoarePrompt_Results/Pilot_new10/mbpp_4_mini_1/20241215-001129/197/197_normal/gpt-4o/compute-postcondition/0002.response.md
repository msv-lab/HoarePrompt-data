The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elements`. `tup` is a tuple, and `elements` is a list of elements. After executing the function body, the function returns the total occurrences of each element from the list `elements` found in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and return the count of how many times the elements from the list appear in the tuple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list of elements, returning the total occurrences of the elements from the list in the tuple.**
