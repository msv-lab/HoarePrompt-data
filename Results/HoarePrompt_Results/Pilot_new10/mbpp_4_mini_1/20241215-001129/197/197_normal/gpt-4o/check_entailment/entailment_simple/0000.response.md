Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to count the occurrence of all elements from a list within a tuple. 

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple, and `elements`, which is expected to be a list of elements whose occurrences we want to count in the tuple.

2. **Count Calculation**: The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to count occurrences. It iterates over each `element` in the `elements` list, and for each one, it calls `tup.count(element)` to find out how many times that particular element appears in the tuple.

3. **Return Value**: The `sum()` function adds up all the counts of each `element`, resulting in the total number of occurrences of all specified elements from the list in the tuple. Finally, the function returns this total count.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test the function with different tuples and lists, and they check if the function produces the expected total count of occurrences. All assertions validate the function's correctness for those cases.

Since the program consistently meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, it can be concluded that the function is implemented correctly.
