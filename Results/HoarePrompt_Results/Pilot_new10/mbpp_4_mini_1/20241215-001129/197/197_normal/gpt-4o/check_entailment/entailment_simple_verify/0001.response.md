Final: **False**

The original assessment concluded that the program is correct, but did not adequately address the issue regarding the potential failure of the function to handle certain complex data types, such as dictionaries or lists, within the tuple. While the assumptions about valid input cover typical cases, they overlook nuances in equality comparisons for mutable types. Therefore, given the presence of this edge case, the final assessment is that the program is indeed incorrect.
