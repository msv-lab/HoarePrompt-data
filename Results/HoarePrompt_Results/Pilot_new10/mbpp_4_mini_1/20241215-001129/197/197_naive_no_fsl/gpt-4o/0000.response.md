To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will analyze the function `func_1` and its behavior with various inputs.

The problem requires counting the occurrences of all elements from a list in a tuple. The implementation defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple (`tup`) and a list of elements (`elements`). It counts how many times each element in the list appears in the tuple and sums the counts.

Here's how the function operates based on the given examples:

1. For input (`('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']`), the count would be:
   - Count of 'a': 2
   - Count of 'b': 1
   - Total = 2 + 1 = 3. The assertion checks this correctly.
   
2. For input (`(1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]`), the count would be:
   - Count of 1: 3
   - Count of 4: 2
   - Count of 7: 1
   - Total = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. The assertion checks this correctly.
   
3. For input (`(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]`), the count would be:
   - Count of 1: 1
   - Count of 2: 1
   - Total = 1 + 1 = 2. The assertion checks this correctly.

Now, looking deeper into the logic and potential edge cases:

- If a number in the `elements` list does not appear in the tuple, the count for that number should be 0, and it should not affect the overall sum. The function handles this correctly with `sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))`.

- The program assumes the tuples and lists can contain any type of elements, including strings, integers, etc. There are no type checks, meaning it will rely on Python's inherent ability to correctly count instances of elements, which generally works as expected.

- However, if the `elements` list is empty, the function should return a count of `0`. The implementation does not explicitly handle the case when `elements` is an empty list, but the use of `sum` over an empty generator makes it behave correctly, returning `0`.

- One case where the function might not work effectively is with complex data types like dictionaries or lists within the tuple. In such cases, comparing identity with `==` may yield unexpected results. For example:
  ```python
  assert func_1(({'key': 'value'}, {'key': 'value'}), [{'key': 'value'}]) == 0  # This will fail
  ```

In this case, because the function does not account for the fact that referencing dictionaries or lists as occurrences may not work for equality checks but rather identity checks (i.e., the objects being the same in memory), this reveals a flaw.

Therefore, since I found a situation where the program does not work correctly, the final judgement is:

Correctness: **False**
