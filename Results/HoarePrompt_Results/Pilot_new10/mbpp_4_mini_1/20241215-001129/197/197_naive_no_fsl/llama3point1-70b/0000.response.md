To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))
```

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The function takes two arguments: `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple, and `lst`, which is expected to be a list.
2. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function. It iterates over each `element` in `lst`, counts how many times that `element` appears in `tup`, and sums these counts.
3. The program returns the total count of these occurrences.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. **Empty Tuple and List:** If both inputs are empty, the function should return 0. The program handles this correctly since `sum([])` evaluates to 0.
2. **Element Not in Tuple:** If the list contains an element that does not exist in the tuple, `tup.count(element)` will return 0 for that element. This is also handled correctly.
3. **Multiple Occurrences:** If an element appears multiple times in the tuple or the list, the function should correctly tally these occurrences. The implementation accounts for this as well.
4. **Different Data Types:** If elements of the list are of types that do not match those in the tuple (e.g., comparing a string from `lst` with an integer in `tup`), the count will be 0, which is also expected behavior.
5. **Duplicate Elements in List:** If the list has duplicate elements, the function will count the occurrences multiple times, which aligns with the problem description.

Considering all the above points, the function correctly implements the required functionality and handles edge cases as anticipated.

Correctness: **True**

The explanation is that the program accurately counts the occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple for all the cases examined, and there are no edge cases left unhandled.
