To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both carefully.

**Problem Description:**
The function must check if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. 

**Annotated Program Analysis:**
```python
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
    return False
```

1. **String Slicing (s[1:-1]):** 
    - The slicing `s[1:-1]` means the substring is taken from the second character to the second-to-last character. This effectively excludes the first and last characters, which aligns with the requirement of not considering 'z' at the start or end of the string.

2. **Checking for 'z':** 
    - The check `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` correctly identifies if there is a 'z' present in the specified substring. If there is, the function returns `True`, which indicates compliance with the problem condition.

3. **Return Condition:**
    - If 'z' is not found in the specified range, the function correctly returns `False`.

4. **Test Cases:**
    - The assertion `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True` would fail if 'z' was at an inappropriate position; however, it returns `True` since 'z' is not at the start or end.
    - The assertion `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False` is correct as 'z' is at the start.
    - The assertion `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False` is also correct as there is no 'z' involved.

Thus, the program checks the specified conditions correctly and returns expected results for all given test cases.

Based on this thorough analysis, we conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the requirement of checking for 'z' in a string while excluding the first and last character, achieving the desired functional behavior as described in the problem statement.
