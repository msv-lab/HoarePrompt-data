The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string. After executing the function body, if the conditions regarding the presence of character 'z' within the string (specifically, in the substring excluding the first and last characters) are satisfied, the function returns `True`. If the first case is not satisfied, the function may still return `True` based on other internal checks indicated by Case_2 and Case_3. However, if none of the conditions related to having words greater than 1 length and containing 'z' in the specified substring are met, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return `True` if it satisfies certain conditions related to the character 'z' within the string; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s and returns True if certain conditions regarding the presence of character 'z' within the string are satisfied; otherwise, it returns False if no applicable conditions are met.**
