The variable `words` is assigned the result of `s.split()`, which processes the string `s` and splits it into a list of words based on whitespace. The value of `s` remains unchanged, but `words` now contains a list of the words derived from `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string; `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s` on whitespace.**
