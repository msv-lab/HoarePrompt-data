Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the function does not correctly adhere to the problem description. The function `func_1` checks for the presence of 'z' only in the central characters of each word and ignores 'z' at the start or end, which is in line with the problem requirements. However, the original assessment fails to recognize that the function correctly returns `False` when 'z' exists only at the start or end of a word. On the contrary, there are multiple scenarios where the function will correctly identify words that do have 'z' in other positions, while returning `True` as expected. Therefore, considering the annotated version confirms the functionality as per the problem statement, thus the program is deemed correct overall.
