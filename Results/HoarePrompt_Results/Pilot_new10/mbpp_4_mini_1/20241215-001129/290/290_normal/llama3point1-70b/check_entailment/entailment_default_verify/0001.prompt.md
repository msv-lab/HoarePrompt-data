You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program checks if any word in the input string contains the letter 'z' except at the start and end of the word. Here's why the program is correct:

1. It splits the input string into individual words.
2. It iterates through each word and checks:
   - If the word's length is greater than 1 (to ensure there are characters between the first and last ones), and
   - If the letter 'z' is present in the substring of the word that excludes the first and the last characters (i.e., `word[1:-1]`).
3. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`.
4. If no words satisfy the conditions, it returns `False`.

It correctly identifies the presence of 'z' in valid positions and handles edge cases like:
- Words of length 1 or 0 (which can't contain 'z' in between).
- Words that start or end with 'z'.

The program should work correctly for any input case based on the problem description provided. I couldn't find an example where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string `s`, splits it into words, and checks if any of those words have a length greater than 1 and contain the character 'z' within their substring (excluding the first and last characters). It returns True if such a word is found, and False if no such word exists. An edge case includes an empty string input, which results in an immediate return of False, since there would be no words to check. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a string; such a scenario could lead to an AttributeError when attempting to call the split() method. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
