According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `words`. If the list has at least 2 words, the loop can execute again for the second word. At the end of the last iteration, `words` must have at least 1 word, and `word` is the first word in the list. Since the length of `word` is less than or equal to 1 or 'z' is not present in the appropriate substring of `word`, we need to ensure that for the loop to execute one more time, `words` must have at least 2 words and the `word` needs to be the second word in the list.

State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of words that must have at least 2 words, `word` is the second word in the list.**
