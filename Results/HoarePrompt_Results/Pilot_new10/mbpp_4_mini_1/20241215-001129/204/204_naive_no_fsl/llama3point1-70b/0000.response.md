Correctness: **True**

The program checks whether the given month number contains 31 days by utilizing a list of months that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). The function simply checks if the input month number `n` is in this list.

All months of the year are represented, and the function correctly identifies those months with 31 days. It will return `True` for any of these months and `False` for all other months (February, April, June, September, November). 

Since the function accurately represents the requirements set forth in the problem description without missing any potential cases, the correctness is confirmed as true.
