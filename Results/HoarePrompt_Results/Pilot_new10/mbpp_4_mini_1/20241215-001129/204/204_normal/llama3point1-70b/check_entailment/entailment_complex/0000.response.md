Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to check if a given month number contains 31 days. Here's why it always does what the problem description specifies:

1. **Input Constraints**: The function accepts an integer `n`, which is specified to be between 1 and 12, representing the months of the year. This aligns with the problem description that states input should be a valid month number.

2. **Positive Months with 31 Days**: The list `months_31_days` contains the month numbers that correspond to months with 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

3. **Return Value**: The function uses the expression `return n in months_31_days`, which evaluates to `True` if `n` is in the list of months with 31 days and `False` otherwise. This directly addresses the requirement outlined in the problem description.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The function handles all month numbers (from 1 to 12) appropriately by returning `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for all other months, including February (2) and those with 30 days (April, June, September, November).

Overall, the program meets the problem's requirements effectively, and there are no cases where it fails to do so.
