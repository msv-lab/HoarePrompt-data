Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly identifies whether a given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days. The problem description requires a function that checks this condition, and the provided program does exactly that by using a list that contains the month numbers with 31 days. The annotations further corroborate the correctness of the function, confirming that it returns `True` for valid inputs representing months that have 31 days and `False` for all others. Since there are no missing cases and the function operates within the specified input constraints, the assessment remains valid.
