Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function correctly identifies whether the given month number corresponds to a month that contains 31 days by checking if the integer `n` is present in the predefined list of months with 31 days: [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]. The annotations clarify that the input `n` is guaranteed to be a valid integer within the range of 1 to 12, thus ensuring that the function behaves correctly without handling any invalid inputs. Overall, the function aligns with the problem description and accurately fulfills its requirements.
