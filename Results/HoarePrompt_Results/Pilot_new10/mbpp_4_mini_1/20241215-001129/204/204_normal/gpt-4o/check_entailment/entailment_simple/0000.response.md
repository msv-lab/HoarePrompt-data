Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether the given month number corresponds to a month that has 31 days. The function `func_1` utilizes a set `months_with_31_days` which includes the months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). If the provided `month` is found in this set, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The assertions provided before the function call test various months:
- `func_1(5)` returns `True`, correctly identifies May as having 31 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False`, correctly identifies February as not having 31 days.
- `func_1(6)` returns `False`, correctly identifies June as not having 31 days.
- `func_1(1)` returns `True`, correctly identifies January as having 31 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `True`, correctly identifies December as having 31 days.
- `func_1(11)` returns `False`, correctly identifies November as not having 31 days.

Since the function behaves correctly for all possible input cases as per the problem description, it reliably determines if the month in question has 31 days. Thus, it fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
