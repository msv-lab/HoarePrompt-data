The original assessment states that the function `func_1(month)` is correct because it accurately determines if a given month has 31 days based on the set of months it defines. The provided tests support this conclusion by confirming that for valid month inputs (1 to 12), the function returns the expected results.

However, the output hints indicate a crucial limitation: the function does not handle cases where the input `month` is outside the range of 1 to 12. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the input were to be a value outside this range, as in such cases, it would return `False`, not accounting for the fact that the input was invalid in the context of months.

Given that the problem description implies the function should correctly handle all valid month numbers and should not produce misleading outputs when it encounters invalid inputs, this flaw indicates that the function does not fully meet the requirements established by the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment claiming the function's correctness fails to consider that the function does not sufficiently guard against invalid inputs. As a result, I conclude that the function is not correct in all scenarios as described.

Final: **False**.
