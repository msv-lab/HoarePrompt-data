Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identified that while the function does not explicitly handle invalid month numbers (such as 0 or 13), the provided annotations clarify that the input is expected to be a valid integer within the range of 1 to 12. Since the problem description specifies a valid month number as input, and the annotated code confirms that the function behaves correctly for the defined range of inputs (1 to 12), the program fulfills its intended purpose. Thus, based on the assumptions that valid input will be provided, the overall correctness of the function stands as accurate according to the problem description.
