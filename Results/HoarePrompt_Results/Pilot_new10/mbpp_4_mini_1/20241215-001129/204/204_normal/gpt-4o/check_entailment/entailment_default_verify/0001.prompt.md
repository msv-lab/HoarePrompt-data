You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the month number is invalid. For example, if `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` is called, the function will return `False`, but there is no clear indication that these inputs are invalid. The requirement is to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not, but the function does not account for invalid month numbers such as 0 or 13, which should ideally raise an error or indicate that the input is invalid. Thus, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `month` (expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive) and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to a month with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), and `False` otherwise. The function does not handle cases where `month` is outside the range of 1 to 12. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
