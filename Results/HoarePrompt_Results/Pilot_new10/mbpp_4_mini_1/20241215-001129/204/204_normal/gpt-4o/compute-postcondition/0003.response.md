Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `month` (expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive) and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to a month with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), and `False` otherwise. The function does not handle cases where `month` is outside the range of 1 to 12.**
