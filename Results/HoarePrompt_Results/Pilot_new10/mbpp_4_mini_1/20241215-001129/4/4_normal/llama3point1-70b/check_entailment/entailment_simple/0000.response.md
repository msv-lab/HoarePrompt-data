Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to determine the differences between the two numbers (`num1` and `num2`). The result of the XOR operation will have bits set to `1` wherever the bits of `num1` and `num2` differ. 

By using the `bin()` function, the program converts the result of the XOR operation into its binary representation. The `count('1')` method then counts the number of `1`s in this binary string. If the count is exactly `1`, it indicates that `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position, which aligns with the requirement of the problem description.

In summary, the program is correct because it accurately identifies whether `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position by counting the number of differing bits in their binary representation. Therefore, it fulfills the task defined in the problem description for all potential inputs.
