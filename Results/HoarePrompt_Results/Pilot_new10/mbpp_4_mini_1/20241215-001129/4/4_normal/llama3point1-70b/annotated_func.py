#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one '1', and False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, num1 and num2, and returns True if the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one '1', indicating that num1 and num2 differ by exactly one bit. It returns False otherwise. This function effectively checks if the two numbers are "neighbors" in binary representation, which means they could be represented as a single bit flip from one to the other.
