Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ by exactly one bit position. The use of the bitwise XOR operation (`num1 ^ num2`) highlights the differences between the two numbers in their binary representation. The following clarifications can be made to ensure correctness:

1. The XOR operation will result in a number that has binary '1's only at positions where the bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.
2. The function then counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result with `bin(...).count('1')`.
3. If there is exactly one '1', it indicates that the two numbers indeed differ by exactly one bit position.

Thus, the function handles all potential cases correctly, returning `True` only when the two numbers differ by one bit, and `False` for all other cases, including when they are equal or differ by more than one bit.
