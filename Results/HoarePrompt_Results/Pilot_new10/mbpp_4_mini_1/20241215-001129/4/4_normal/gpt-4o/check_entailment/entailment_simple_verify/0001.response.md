The original assessment accurately identifies the purpose of the function `func_1` and how it operates using bitwise XOR to determine if two integers differ at exactly one bit position. The explanation of the logic and test cases included in the original assessment is also correct and illustrates the function's intended behavior well.

However, the original assessment mistakenly concludes that the function is incorrect solely based on the lack of handling an input scenario where both numbers are equal. As per the problem description provided, the task focuses on checking if two numbers differ at one bit position only, hence if both numbers are the same, the expected behavior is indeed to return False. 

The annotated code supports the original reasoningâ€”the XOR operation and subsequent bit-checking logic hold true for determining if two numbers only differ at one bit position. The function handles valid inputs correctly as intended by the problem description.

Since the original assessment correctly evaluates the function and its implementation, and the additional scenario noted doesn't contradict the correctness of the function's logic in handling differing bits, I conclude that the program correctly meets the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
