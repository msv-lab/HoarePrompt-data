Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, which is to check whether two numbers differ at only one bit position. 

Here's how the function works:

1. **Bitwise XOR Operation**: The function first computes the bitwise XOR of the two integers `a` and `b` using `a ^ b`. The result of this operation is a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different.

2. **Checking if Different**: The function checks if `xor_result` is not equal to 0. If `xor_result` is 0, it means `a` and `b` are identical, which is not a case where they differ at one bit position.

3. **Power of Two Check**: The function then checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2. This is done using the expression `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`. A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. Therefore, if `xor_result` is a power of 2, it implies that `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position.

The assertions provided in the annotated code cover various test cases:
- `func_1(13, 9) == True`: 13 (binary `1101`) and 9 (binary `1001`) differ at one bit.
- `func_1(15, 8) == False`: 15 (binary `1111`) and 8 (binary `1000`) differ at multiple bits.
- `func_1(2, 4) == False`: 2 (binary `10`) and 4 (binary `100`) differ at multiple bits.
- `func_1(2, 3) == True`: 2 (binary `10`) and 3 (binary `11`) differ at one bit.
- `func_1(5, 1) == True`: 5 (binary `101`) and 1 (binary `001`) differ at one bit.
- `func_1(1, 5) == True`: 1 (binary `001`) and 5 (binary `101`) differ at one bit (the order does not matter).

Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem by correctly identifying when two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Hence, the correctness statement is supported through the logical flow and the test cases.
