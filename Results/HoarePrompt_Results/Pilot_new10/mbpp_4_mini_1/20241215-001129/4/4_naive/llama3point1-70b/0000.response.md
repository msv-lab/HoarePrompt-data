Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The expression `num1 ^ num2` calculates the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`, resulting in a binary number where each bit is set to `1` only if the corresponding bits of `num1` and `num2` differ. By counting the number of `1`s in the binary representation of this result, the code checks if there is exactly one differing bit. 

The only case that would return `True` is when the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, and the count is checked to be `1`. This means all edge cases, including when one number is the same or they differ at multiple bits, are handled correctly by returning `False`. 

Therefore, after considering potential inputs, the code works as expected.
