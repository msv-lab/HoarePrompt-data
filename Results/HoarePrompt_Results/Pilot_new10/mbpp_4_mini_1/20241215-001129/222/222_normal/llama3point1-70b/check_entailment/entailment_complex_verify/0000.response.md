Based on the problem description, the function is supposed to remove all lowercase substrings from a given string. The provided implementation of the function only retains uppercase characters and entirely misses the requirement to remove lowercase characters from the original string.

The original assessment states that the function fails to meet the requirements because it does not correctly handle the need to remove lowercase characters from the input string. Instead, it extracts and returns uppercase characters, which is indeed a different operation from what was requested.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function simply gathers uppercase characters while disregarding lowercase characters. Thus, the function's operation is consistent with the initial assessment and does not align with the problem's requirement to remove lowercase characters.

Final: **False**.
