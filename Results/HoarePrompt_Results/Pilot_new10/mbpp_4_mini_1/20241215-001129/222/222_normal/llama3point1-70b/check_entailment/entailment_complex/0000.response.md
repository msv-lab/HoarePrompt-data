Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string, meaning it should return a string with all lowercase letters removed. However, the annotated program only returns the uppercase characters of the string `s`, which does not fulfill the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. 

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program would return "HW", while it should return "HelloWorld" after removing the lowercase letters. This behavior shows that the program does not correctly implement the required functionality specified in the problem description.
