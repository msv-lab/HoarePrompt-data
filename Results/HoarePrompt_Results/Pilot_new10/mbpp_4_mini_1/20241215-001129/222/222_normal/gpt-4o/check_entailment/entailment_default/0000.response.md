Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement to remove lowercase substrings from a given string by filtering out all lowercase characters. The function `func_1` utilizes a list comprehension to generate a new string that only contains uppercase characters from the input string `s`. 

The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a string with only uppercase characters, and in cases where there are no uppercase characters, the function returns an empty string. The provided assertions serve as examples that demonstrate the function's correctness for various input cases.

Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description and correctly handles the specified cases, we conclude that it is correct.
