Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(s: str)` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that contains only the uppercase characters from `s`. 

The assertions provided confirm that it functions correctly for the given test cases:

- For the input `PYTHon`, it returns `PYTH`.
- For the input `FInD`, it returns `FID`.
- For the input `STRinG`, it returns `STRG`.

Additionally, the function handles the case where there are no uppercase characters: if `s` does not contain any uppercase characters, it returns an empty string, which is consistent with the description.

Overall, the function adheres correctly to the problem requirements for all potential cases, fulfilling the objective of removing lowercase substrings by retaining only uppercase characters.
