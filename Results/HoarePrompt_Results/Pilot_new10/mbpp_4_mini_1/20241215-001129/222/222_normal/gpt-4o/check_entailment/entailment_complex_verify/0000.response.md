Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The problem description requires a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string, and the implementation of `func_1` achieves this by returning only the uppercase characters from the input string. The annotated version reiterates this functionality, confirming that the program behaves as intendedâ€”removing lowercase letters while maintaining the uppercase ones. The assertions provided in the program also successfully validate the expected outputs, aligning with the function's specifications. Therefore, the correctness assessment remains valid.
