Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the problem description's requirement of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead of removing lowercase substrings, the function only returns a string containing uppercase characters. 

Here's why it does not meet the problem description:

1. **Problem Statement**: The task is to "remove lowercase substrings."
2. **Function Behavior**: The function `func_1(s)` iterates through each character in the input string `s` and includes only the uppercase characters in its return value. This means that it discards lowercase characters rather than removing "lowercase substrings."

For example, given the input `s = 'abcDEFg'`, the function would return `'DF'`, which is not removing lowercase "substrings" as per the problem's requirement but merely filtering out individual lowercase letters.

Thus, the function does not align with the specified requirement of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
