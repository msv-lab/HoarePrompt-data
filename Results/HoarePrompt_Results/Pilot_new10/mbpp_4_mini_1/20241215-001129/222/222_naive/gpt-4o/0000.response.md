Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string. The function `func_1` iterates through each character in the input string `s` and includes only uppercase characters in the output string. This means that all lowercase letters are effectively removed.

The assertions given also correctly test the function:

1. `func_1('PYTHon')` should return `'PYTH'`.
2. `func_1('FInD')` should return `'FID'`.
3. `func_1('STRinG')` should return `'STRG'`.

All these cases are handled correctly by the code. Since the logic of constructing a new string based solely on uppercase letters matches the requirement to remove lowercase substrings, there are no cases where this program does not work as expected. Thus, the program is correct for the given problem description.
