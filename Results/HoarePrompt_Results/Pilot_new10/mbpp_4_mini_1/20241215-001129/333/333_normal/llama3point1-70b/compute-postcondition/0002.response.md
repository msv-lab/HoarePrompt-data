To determine what states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the `expression` string. The loop will iterate over each character in the `expression`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, the `expression` string must contain at least one character. The `stack` being empty initially is fine because it can be populated during the loop's execution.

So, we need to ensure that:
1. The `expression` is not an empty string.
2. The character `char` can be any character from the `expression` starting with the first character.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of the `expression`**
