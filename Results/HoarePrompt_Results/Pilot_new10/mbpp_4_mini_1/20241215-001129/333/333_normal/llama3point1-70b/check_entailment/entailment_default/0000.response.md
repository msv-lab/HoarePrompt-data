Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to check if the given expression has balanced brackets. It follows this process: it maintains a stack to keep track of opening brackets and checks if closing brackets correspond to the most recently added opening brackets. The function uses a dictionary to map opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. 

The function returns `True` if all opening brackets have matching closing brackets in the correct order, and it returns `False` if any closing bracket is found without a corresponding opening bracket or if any brackets are unbalanced. The output hints align perfectly with how the code operates.

This functionality holds true for all potential edge cases, including:
- Strings with no brackets, which should return `True`.
- Strings with only opening brackets or only closing brackets, which should return `False`.
- Nested brackets or mixed types of brackets (e.g., `[{()}]`), which will also correctly return `True` if balanced.

Since the code addresses all scenarios outlined in the problem description and the hints agree with its behavior, it is confirmed to be correct.
