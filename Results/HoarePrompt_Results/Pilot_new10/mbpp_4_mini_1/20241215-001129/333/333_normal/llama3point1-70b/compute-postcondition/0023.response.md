Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with `n` characters. If `char` is in `brackets`, then `char` is included in `stack`. If `char` is not in `brackets`, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the popped character from the stack does not match `char` based on the brackets mapping; if either condition is true, it returns False. If neither condition is true, the execution continues without a return value, meaning the state of the stack remains unchanged.***
