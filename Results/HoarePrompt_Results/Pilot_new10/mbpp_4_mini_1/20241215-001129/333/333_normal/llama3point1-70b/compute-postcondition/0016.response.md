Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string with `n - 1` characters, `char` is the character at index `i + 1`, and `stack` maintains its previous state. If `char` is in `brackets.values()` and if `stack` is empty or the top of the `stack` does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, the function returns False, indicating a specific condition is not met based on the current processing of `expression` and `char`. Otherwise, the processing continues with the state of `stack` unchanged if the condition is not met.***
