The `brackets` variable is assigned a dictionary that maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets. This operation does not affect the values of `expression` or `stack`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables along with the new state of `brackets`.

Output State: **`expression` is a string that may contain various characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is an empty list; `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
