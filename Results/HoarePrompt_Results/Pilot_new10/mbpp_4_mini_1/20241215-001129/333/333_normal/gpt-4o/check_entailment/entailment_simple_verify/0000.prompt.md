You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
    return stack == []


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case of unmatched closing brackets. Specifically, if the first closing bracket is reached before its corresponding opening bracket, the program should return `False`, but it only checks for an empty stack after processing all characters. 

For example, the input `'{()}[{]'` is incorrectly represented to return `False` as it has unmatched brackets, but the program would check the stack at the end and may mistakenly return `True`. 

Here's a potential test case that demonstrates the issue:
```python
assert func_1('{[()]}[{}[](') == False
```

In this case, the expression contains unbalanced brackets, and the program would fail to appropriately identify it as such.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string that contains characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and may also include other characters.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expr` is a string consisting of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is empty if `expr` is valid (all pairs matched), otherwise it contains unmatched opening brackets; the matching pairs of brackets are stored in `matching_pairs`.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if 'stack' is empty, indicating that all pairs of brackets in the expression 'expr' are matched; otherwise, it returns False if 'stack' contains unmatched opening brackets.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
