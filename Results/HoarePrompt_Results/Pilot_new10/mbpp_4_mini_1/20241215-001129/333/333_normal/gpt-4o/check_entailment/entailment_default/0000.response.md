The code provided in the function `func_1` appears to correctly check for balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each closing bracket corresponds to the last unmatched opening bracket. 

Here's how it works:

1. It initializes an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.
2. It iterates through each character in the input string `expr`.
3. If the character is an opening bracket (one of `(`, `{`, or `[`), it gets pushed onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket (one of `)`, `}`, or `]`), the function checks if the stack is empty (which would imply an unmatched closing bracket) or if the top element of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either of these conditions is true, it returns `False`.
5. Finally, after processing all characters, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, this means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, and it returns `True`. If it's not empty, it returns `False`, indicating unmatched opening brackets.

The output hints clarify that the function will ignore any non-bracket characters, which aligns well with the problem description. 

However, the critical part to verify correctness involves checking whether it can handle all potential cases described. The hints suggest it can handle different configurations of brackets correctly.

Now, considering potential edge cases:
- An input like `'{[()()]}'` should return `True`.
- An input like `'{[()()]'` should return `False` (unmatched opening bracket).
- An input with mixed content like `'{a+[b*(c+d)]}'` (where characters are involved) should also return `True`, as the brackets themselves are balanced.

Taking all of this into account, the program doesn't seem to misbehave for any tested scenarios, and the logic aligns perfectly with the requirements in the problem description.

Thus, my conclusion regarding the correctness of this function is:

Correctness: **True**.
