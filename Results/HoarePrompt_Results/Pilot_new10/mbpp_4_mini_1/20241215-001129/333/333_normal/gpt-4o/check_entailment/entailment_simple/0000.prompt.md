You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string that contains characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and may also include other characters.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expr` is a string consisting of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is empty if `expr` is valid (all pairs matched), otherwise it contains unmatched opening brackets; the matching pairs of brackets are stored in `matching_pairs`.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if 'stack' is empty, indicating that all pairs of brackets in the expression 'expr' are matched; otherwise, it returns False if 'stack' contains unmatched opening brackets.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
