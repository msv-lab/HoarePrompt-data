Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string with at least 2 characters, `char` is updated to the next character in `expr`. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, then `stack` now includes `char` as an additional element. If `char` is not in `matching_pairs.values()`, the function checks if `char` is in `matching_pairs`; it returns False if the stack is empty or if the character popped from the stack does not match the corresponding character in `matching_pairs` for `char`. If neither condition holds, no specific return value is defined.***
