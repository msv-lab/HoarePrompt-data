The `char` variable, which is the first character of `expr`, is appended to the `stack`. The `stack` was previously an empty list, and now it will contain one element, which is the value of `char`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`expr` is a string with at least 1 character, `stack` is a list containing the character `char`, `char` is the first character of `expr`.**
