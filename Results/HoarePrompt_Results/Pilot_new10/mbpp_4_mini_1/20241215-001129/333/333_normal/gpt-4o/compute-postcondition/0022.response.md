Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the next character in `expr`, if `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the function returns False if the stack is empty or if the character popped from the stack does not match the corresponding character in `matching_pairs` for `char`. If neither condition holds, no specific return value is defined. There is no specific else part in the code.***
