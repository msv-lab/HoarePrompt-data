To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic for checking whether an expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets.

The key aspects of a balanced expression are as follows:
1. Every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
2. Brackets must be closed in the correct order; that is, the last opened bracket must be the first to be closed (LIFO - Last In, First Out).

Now, let's analyze the provided program step-by-step:

```python
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)  # Push opening brackets onto stack
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:  # Check for matching closing bracket
                return False
    return not stack  # Return True if no unmatched opening brackets remain
```

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Empty String**: The function should return `True` for an empty string since there are no unmatched brackets.
  
2. **Simple Balanced Expressions**: Strings like `"()"`, `"{}"`, `"[]"`, `"({[]})"` should return `True`.

3. **Unbalanced Expressions**:
   - Cases like `")"`, `"("`, `"{]", "[}"`, `"(()"`, which should return `False`.
   - The function will handle these cases correctly as it checks if there are unmatched closing brackets or unmatched opening brackets.

4. **Nested and Mixed Bracket Cases**:
   - Strings like `"((()))"`, `"{[()]}"` should return `True`.
   - Strings like `"{[(])}"` should return `False`.

5. **Non-bracket Characters**: The function does not account for and ignores non-bracket characters, which is acceptable based on the problem description that only mentions brackets.

### Analysis and Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it correctly handles various edge cases and adheres to the problem description effectively. The program checks for matching closing brackets and ensures that opening brackets are properly closed in the correct order, returning `False` when mismatches are found.

Since I can think of no potential inputs or edge cases where this implementation would fail, I conclude that the program successfully satisfies the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
