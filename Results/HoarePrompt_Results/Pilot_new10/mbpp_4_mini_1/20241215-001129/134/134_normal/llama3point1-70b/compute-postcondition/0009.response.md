The variable `sum` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(n, i)` to its current value. The value of `math.comb(n, i)` computes the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose `i` elements from `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. Given that `i` is `2`, the updated value will be `sum = (1 + n) + math.comb(n, 2)`.

The value `math.comb(n, 2)` simplifies to `n(n - 1) / 2` for positive integers `n`. Therefore, `sum` becomes `1 + n + n(n - 1) / 2`.

Since the value of `n` is still a positive integer, we can express the updated state of `sum` in a more descriptive manner.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + n + n(n - 1) / 2`, `i` is 2**
