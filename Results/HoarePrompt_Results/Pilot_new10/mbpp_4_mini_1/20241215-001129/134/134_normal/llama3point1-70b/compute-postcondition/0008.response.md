According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `n + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` is 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n + 1` will be at least 2, so the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will increase by 1, which means it will become 2.

Now we must ensure that the `sum` value is correctly set based on whether `i` is odd or even. Since `i` will be 2 in the next iteration (and is even), `sum` will be set to `1 + n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + n`, `i` is 2**
