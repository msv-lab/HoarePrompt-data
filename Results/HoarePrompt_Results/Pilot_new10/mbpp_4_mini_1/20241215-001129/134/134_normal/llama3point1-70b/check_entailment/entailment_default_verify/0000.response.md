The program definition and original assessment indicate that the function is intended to compute the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices. The program, `func_1`, iterates through indices from 0 to `n` and includes only those which are even, summing the corresponding binomial coefficients calculated by `math.comb(n, i)`.

The output hint confirms that the function directly performs this task by summarizing that it calculates the sum for all even integers from 0 to `n`.

Given that:

1. The logic of the program properly identifies even indices.
2. The usage of `math.comb(n, i)` ensures the correct calculation of binomial coefficients, since `math.comb` handles cases where `i` is greater than `n` appropriately by returning zero.
3. The output hints summarizing the function's operation align with its intended behavior.

There is no evidence from either the problem description or the output hints to suggest that the program fails in any cases for valid inputs, which are defined as positive integers.

Therefore, the original assessment is indeed accurate based on the provided information.

Final: **True**
