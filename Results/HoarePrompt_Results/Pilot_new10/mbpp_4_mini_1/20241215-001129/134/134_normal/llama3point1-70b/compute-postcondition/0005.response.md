According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `n + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which is even, and since `n` is a positive integer, `n + 1` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain a positive integer and `i` should now be 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 1**
