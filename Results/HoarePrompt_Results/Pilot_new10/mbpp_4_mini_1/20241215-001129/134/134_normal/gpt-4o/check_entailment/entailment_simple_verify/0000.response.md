Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not fulfill the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients. Instead, the function simply returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not correspond to the correct output needed for the task at hand.

For example, as elaborated in the original assessment, when calculating for `n = 4`, the expected output according to the problem description would be the sum of the even index coefficients: C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7. However, the program incorrectly returns `8` when using `func_1(4)`.

Thus, the original assessment rightly points out the discrepancy between the program's output and the expected result based on the problem description. This shows that the logic implemented in the function does not address the requirements of the task, leading to the conclusion that the program is indeed incorrect.
