Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function that finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer `n`. However, the provided program calculates `2 ** (n - 1)` instead, which does not correspond to the required computation of binomial coefficients.

For instance, consider `n = 4`. The binomial coefficients for `n=4` are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 (from the expansion of (a + b)^4). The even index coefficients are 1 (index 0) and 6 (index 2), and their sum is 7, not `2 ** (4 - 1) = 8`.

Therefore, the logic in the function does not align with the problem description, hence it is incorrect.
