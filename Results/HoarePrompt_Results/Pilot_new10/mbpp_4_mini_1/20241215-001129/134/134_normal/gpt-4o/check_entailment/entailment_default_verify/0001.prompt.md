You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the Python program provided in relation to its problem description, we need to analyze the function it defines and its intended purpose.

The problem description asks for a function that takes a positive integer \( n \) and finds the sum of the even index binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficients are given by the expression \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \) for \( k = 0, 1, \ldots, n \).

The sum of binomial coefficients at even indices \( C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + C(n, 4) + \ldots \) will yield a different result than \( 2^{n-1} \) for all \( n \). Specifically, the sum of the even index binomial coefficients is equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \times (2^n) \) because the total sum of binomial coefficients for any integer \( n \) is \( 2^n \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients at even indices should be \( 2^{n-1} \).

1. For \( n = 4 \):
   - Even indices: \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) \) = \( 1 + 6 = 7 \), but program returns \( 8 \).
   
2. For \( n = 6 \):
   - Even indices: \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) \) = \( 1 + 15 + 15 = 31 \), but program returns \( 32 \).
   
3. For \( n = 2 \):
   - Even indices: \( C(2, 0) = 1 \), but program returns \( 2 \).

Based on these assessments, we can conclude that the calculations done in the provided function do not match the expectations based on the definition of the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1). There are no edge cases or missing logic as the code correctly computes this value for positive integers. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
