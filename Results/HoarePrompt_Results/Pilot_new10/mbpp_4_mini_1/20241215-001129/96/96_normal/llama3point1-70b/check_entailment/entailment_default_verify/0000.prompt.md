You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type. It achieves this by converting the types of each element in the tuple into a set and then checking if the length of this set is equal to 1. This method effectively identifies whether all elements are of the same type, as a set will contain only unique items. 

Yes, here are the reasons the code should work correctly for all potential cases:
- If the tuple is empty, `len(set())` will be 0, which is not equal to 1, and the function will correctly return `False`.
- If the tuple contains elements of the same type (e.g., (1, 2, 3)), the set will have a single unique type, and the function will return `True`.
- If the tuple contains mixed types (e.g., (1, 'two', 3.0)), the set will have different types, resulting in a return value of `False`.

Overall, the program handles all specified cases and edge cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type; otherwise, it returns `False`. It doesn't handle cases where `tup` is empty or contains only one element since it inherently returns `True` for those cases. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
