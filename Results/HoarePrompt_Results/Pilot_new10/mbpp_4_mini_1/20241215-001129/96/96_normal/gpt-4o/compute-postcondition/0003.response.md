The variable `first_type` is assigned the type of the first element in the tuple `tup`. Since `tup` is not empty, `tup[0]` will access the first element, and `type(tup[0])` will return the data type of that element. The states of the other variables are not affected, and `first_type` will hold a specific type based on the first element of the tuple.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements of any data type, and `tup` is not empty; `first_type` is the type of the first element in `tup`.**
