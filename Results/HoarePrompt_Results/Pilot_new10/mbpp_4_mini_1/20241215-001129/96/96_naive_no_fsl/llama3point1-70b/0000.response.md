Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It does this by using a set comprehension to collect the types of each element and then checks if the length of that set is equal to 1. Since a set can only contain unique elements, if all elements have the same type, the set will have exactly one element.

For example:
- For the input `(1, 2, 3)`, the types are all `<class 'int'>`, so the function will return `True`.
- For the input `(1, "two", 3.0)`, the types are `<class 'int'>`, `<class 'str'>`, and `<class 'float'>`, so the function will return `False`.

Considering these cases and the nature of tuples, there are no cases where the logic could fail given the provided problem statement. The function handles tuples containing various types correctly and will return the expected output in every possible scenario. Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description comprehensively.
