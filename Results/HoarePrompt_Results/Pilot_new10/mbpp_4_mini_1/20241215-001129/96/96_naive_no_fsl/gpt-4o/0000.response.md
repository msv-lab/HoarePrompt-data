Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks whether all elements in a tuple are of the same data type. Let's analyze the key points:

1. **Empty Tuple**: The function returns `True` for an empty tuple. This is a sensible choice since an empty collection can be considered homogeneous.

2. **First Element Type**: The type of the first element is stored, and the function compares the types of all subsequent elements to this type.

3. **Type Comparison**: The loop checks each element's type against the first element's type and returns `False` if a mismatch is found.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions cover different scenarios:
   - All integers: Returns `True`.
   - Mixed types (integers and string): Returns `False`.
   - Another case with all integers: Again returns `True`.

Since the program captures the requirements of the problem description and there are no edge cases overlooked, I conclude that it can handle all potential cases correctly. Thus, there are no identified issues in its logic, which satisfies the correctness criterion.
