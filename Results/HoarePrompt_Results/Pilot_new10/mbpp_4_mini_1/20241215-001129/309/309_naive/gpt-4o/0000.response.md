Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case for an empty string correctly. According to the problem description, if the input string is empty, it should logically return `True` since there are no differing characters. However, the program currently returns `True` when the string is empty, which is correct, but let's consider the test cases. 

- `assert func_1('python') == False` is correct since not all characters are the same.
- `assert func_1('aaa') == True` is correct since all characters are the same.
- `assert func_1('data') == False` is correct since not all characters are the same.

However, there is a potential case where the function can be misleading since, according to many interpretations, the case of an empty string can be viewed as characters all being the same (because there's no character to compare), but it's not adequately documented or tested in the function itself. 

Additionally, the function does not catch all possible cases (like whitespace or special characters) clearly based on the problem description which does not specify what characters are allowed in the input string.

Because the handling of edge cases isn't clear, especially concerning an empty string and potentially mixed characters, we cannot assert that the function works for all potential inputs. Thus, the function is incorrect.
