You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python') == False
assert func_1('aaa') == True
assert func_1('data') == False

def func_1(s):
    if not s:
        return True
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case for an empty string correctly. According to the problem description, if the input string is empty, it should logically return `True` since there are no differing characters. However, the program currently returns `True` when the string is empty, which is correct, but let's consider the test cases. 

- `assert func_1('python') == False` is correct since not all characters are the same.
- `assert func_1('aaa') == True` is correct since all characters are the same.
- `assert func_1('data') == False` is correct since not all characters are the same.

However, there is a potential case where the function can be misleading since, according to many interpretations, the case of an empty string can be viewed as characters all being the same (because there's no character to compare), but it's not adequately documented or tested in the function itself. 

Additionally, the function does not catch all possible cases (like whitespace or special characters) clearly based on the problem description which does not specify what characters are allowed in the input string.

Because the handling of edge cases isn't clear, especially concerning an empty string and potentially mixed characters, we cannot assert that the function works for all potential inputs. Thus, the function is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string `s` and returns True if `s` is empty or if all characters in the non-empty string are the same as the first character; otherwise, it returns False. If the string is empty, it correctly returns True without further checks. If it contains characters that differ from the first one, it will return False. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
