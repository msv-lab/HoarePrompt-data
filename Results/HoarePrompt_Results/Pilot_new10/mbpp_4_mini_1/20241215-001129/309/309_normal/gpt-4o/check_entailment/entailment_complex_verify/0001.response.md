Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` returns `True` for an empty string input, which could be misleading. However, the program does fulfill the requirement of returning `True` when all characters in the string are the same (including an empty string). The reasoning behind considering an empty string as an edge case is valid, but since the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty string, the function does not technically violate any stated conditions. 

Additionally, the function accurately checks for strings that are not empty, returning `False` when characters differ, and `True` when all characters are the same. Given that valid input is assumed and there is no explicit requirement for handling the empty string in a specific way, the function is considered correct under the problem's constraints.

Therefore, while the function's behavior for an empty string could be debated, it ultimately meets the requirements of checking if all characters in the string are the same if treated as a valid input.
