Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. The function uses `set(s)` to convert the string `s` into a set of unique characters. This is a valid approach, because if all characters in `s` are the same, the set will contain exactly one unique character.
  
2. The expression `len(set(s)) == 1` evaluates to `True` if there is only one unique character in the string. This means that all characters are the same, which is the requirement of the problem.

3. The function also handles the edge case where the string `s` is empty. An empty string will also result in a set of length 0, and according to the comment in the program, the correct behavior should be to return `True` for the case of an empty string. However, strictly speaking, an empty set does not satisfy the condition of having all characters the same, hence this could be a point of discussion.

Upon reviewing the overall logic, it can be interpreted that the function does correctly check for uniformity in character presence and returns appropriate truth values per the stated functionality.

Nevertheless, if the problem description emphasizes that the only characters considered are non-empty cases, then the handling of empty strings could lead to a discrepancy. The program's current logic returns `True` for an empty string, which may not be considered as satisfying the "all characters are the same" condition if it is interpreted to mean that at least one character must exist.

However, given the phrasing, it seems that the program is intended to satisfy cases where the presence of uniform characters is evaluated.

Thus, the function correctly follows the overall requirement of checking for character uniformity, resulting in:

Correctness: **True**
