Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `count` method of strings, which returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the string. The problem description asks to count the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string, which is exactly what the `count` method does. 

All the provided unit tests confirm this behavior, and no potential edge cases can be thought of where this simple and straightforward approach would fail. For instance, it correctly handles the empty string by returning 0, and it also handles cases where 'std' appears at the beginning or end of the string, as well as cases where 'std' appears multiple times or not at all. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that the program is correct for every potential case according to the provided problem description.
