Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(s)` uses the built-in `count()` method in Python, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified string (`'std'` in this case) in the given string `s`. 

The `count()` method works correctly for all possible cases, including:

- Empty strings
- Strings containing the target substring multiple times
- Strings containing the target substring only once
- Strings not containing the target substring at all
- Strings containing the target substring at the beginning, end, or middle

Since the `count()` method handles all these cases correctly, and the function `func_1(s)` simply returns the result of this method, the function works as expected according to the problem description. 

Therefore, I could not find any case where the program does not work correctly, and thus I conclude that the program is correct.
