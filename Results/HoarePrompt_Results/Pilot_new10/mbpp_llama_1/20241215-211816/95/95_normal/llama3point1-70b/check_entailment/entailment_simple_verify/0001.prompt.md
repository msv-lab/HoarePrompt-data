You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to count the number of occurence of the string 'std' in a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in `s`. This is achieved using the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified string.

The program works correctly for every potential case because the `count` method correctly handles:

1. Empty strings: If the input string is empty, `count` will return 0, which is the correct number of occurrences of 'std'.
2. No occurrences: If the string 'std' does not appear in the input string, `count` will return 0.
3. Single occurrence: If the string 'std' appears once in the input string, `count` will return 1.
4. Multiple occurrences: If the string 'std' appears multiple times in the input string, `count` will return the correct count.
5. Overlapping occurrences: Although the `count` method does not count overlapping occurrences, this is actually the desired behavior for counting the occurrences of a substring in a string.

Since the `count` method handles all these cases correctly, the program is correct. There are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')
    #The program returns the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in string s


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
