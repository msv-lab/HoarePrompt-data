#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')
    #The program returns the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in string s
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`, throwing an error if `s` is not a string.
