The code checks if `unique_nums` has more than one element. Since `nums` has at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` will also have at least two elements because it is a list of unique integers from `nums`. 

Given that `unique_nums` is a sorted list, `unique_nums[1]` will be the second smallest unique integer in `nums`. 

The program returns `unique_nums[1]` which is the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.**
