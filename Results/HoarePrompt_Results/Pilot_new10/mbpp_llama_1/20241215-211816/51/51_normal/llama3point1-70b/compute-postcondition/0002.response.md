The code multiplies the current `product` by `num`. The initial state is: `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 1 number, `product` is 1, and `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list.

Given that `product` is initially 1 and `num` is the first number in the list, after the multiplication, `product` will be equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, because 1 multiplied by any number results in that number.

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list**
