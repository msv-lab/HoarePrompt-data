The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of numbers. However, upon analyzing the code, it appears that the function does not calculate the average of the numbers in the list as stated in the annotations. Instead, it calculates the product of all numbers in the list and then divides the product by the count of numbers. 

This is mathematically different from the average, which is calculated as the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers. The code does not handle potential edge cases such as division by zero (although in this case, the list is stated to be non-empty, so division by zero should not occur), or the possibility of the product exceeding the maximum limit of the data type.

Additionally, the code does not check if the list contains any zeros, which would result in a product of zero, regardless of the other numbers in the list. It also does not handle cases where the list contains very large or very small numbers, which could potentially lead to overflow or underflow errors.

Given the actual code, the functionality of the function is to calculate the product of all numbers in the list and return the result divided by the count of numbers, which is not the same as the average. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers, calculates the product of all numbers in the list, and returns the result divided by the count of numbers, which is not equivalent to the average of the numbers in the list **
