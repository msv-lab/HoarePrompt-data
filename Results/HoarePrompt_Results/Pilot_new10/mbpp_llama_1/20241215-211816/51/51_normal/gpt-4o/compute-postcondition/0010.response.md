The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers, which can be either integers or floats, and this list is guaranteed to not be empty. After executing the function body, the function returns the average of all numbers in the list. The average is calculated as the sum of the products of all numbers divided by the total count of numbers. However, the provided description of calculating the average seems to confuse the concept of average with another mathematical operation, as the average is typically the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers, not the product. Assuming the intention was to describe a standard average calculation (which is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements), the correct interpretation would be that the function returns this calculated average. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty list of numbers and return their average.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers and returns their average.**
