The value of `product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. The initial value of `product` is 1, and `num` is the first number in the list. So, the new value of `product` is the initial value of `product` (which is 1) multiplied by the first number in the list (`num`). 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is equal to the first number in the list (since 1 times the first number equals the first number), `num` is the first number in the list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list, `num` is the first number in the `numbers` list**
