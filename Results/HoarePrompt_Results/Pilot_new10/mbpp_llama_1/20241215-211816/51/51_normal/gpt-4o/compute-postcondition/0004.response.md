The given code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by `num` and assigns the result back to `product`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 2 numbers.
- `product` is equal to the first number in the `numbers` list.
- `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list.

After executing the code, `product` will be equal to the product of the first number and the second number in the `numbers` list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 2 numbers, `product` is equal to the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 2 numbers, `product` is equal to the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the second number in the `numbers` list**
