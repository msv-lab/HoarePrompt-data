According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 1 number, the loop can execute. Since we are given that the list is not empty, we can confirm that the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `product` is 1 and `numbers` is a list of numbers, so for the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least 1 number and `num` is the first number in the list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 1 number, `product` is 1, `num` is the first number in the list**
