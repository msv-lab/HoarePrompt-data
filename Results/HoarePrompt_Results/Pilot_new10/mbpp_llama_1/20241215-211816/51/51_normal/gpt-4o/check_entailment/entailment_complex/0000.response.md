Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks to multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the result by the length of the list. However, the correct calculation for the average of the numbers in the list would be to sum all the numbers in the list and then divide by the length of the list, not to multiply all the numbers and then divide by the length.

The provided program correctly implements the calculation described in the problem description, i.e., it multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the result by the length of the list. However, this calculation does not correctly calculate the average of the numbers in the list, which seems to be the intended goal based on the comments.

A correct implementation of the function based on the problem description would be:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
```

But based on the comment in the code, the correct interpretation of the problem description should be:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    sum_of_numbers = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum_of_numbers += num
    result = sum_of_numbers / len(numbers)
    return result
```

However, the original problem description does not match the comment. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description but incorrect based on the comment. Since the problem description and the comment are not consistent, the program cannot be correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**. 

However, if the problem description is considered alone and the comment is ignored, the program would be correct because it implements the calculation described in the problem description. But this is not the case as the comment seems to indicate that the function is supposed to calculate the average of the numbers, which is not what the problem description says. Therefore, the correctness of the program remains **False**. 

A case where this function does not follow a typical calculation is when the list contains a mix of positive and negative numbers or when it contains zero. In such cases, the product of all numbers will be zero or a negative number respectively, which when divided by the length of the list will give a result that is likely not what the user intended. For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 0]`, the function will return `0.0`, which is the result of the product of all numbers divided by the length of the list, but may not be the result that the user expected. 

In conclusion, based on the original problem description, the function seems to be correct but based on the comment and typical use cases, it seems to be incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the program remains **False**.
