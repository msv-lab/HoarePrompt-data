Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(n)` checks whether the given number `n` is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes (or any other power) of its digits. In this case, the function checks if the number is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

The function works by first converting the number to a string, then calculating the length of the string (which represents the number of digits in the number). It then uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to the original number.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function. 

This function handles all potential cases correctly. It works for both positive and negative numbers (although Armstrong numbers are typically defined for positive integers, if the input is negative, the function will still work correctly and return `False`, because the negative number will not be equal to the sum of its digits raised to any power). If the input is a non-integer, the function will throw an error, but this is a reasonable behavior because Armstrong numbers are defined only for integers.

The function also handles the edge cases of single-digit numbers and zero correctly. A single-digit number is always an Armstrong number, because it is equal to its only digit raised to the power of 1. Zero is also an Armstrong number, because 0 is equal to 0^1. The function correctly identifies these numbers as Armstrong numbers. 

Therefore, the function is correct, and it works as expected for all potential cases.
