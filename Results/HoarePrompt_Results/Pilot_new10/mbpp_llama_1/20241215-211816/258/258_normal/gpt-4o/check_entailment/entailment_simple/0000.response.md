To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to determine whether it accurately checks if a given number is an Armstrong number or not, according to the provided problem description.

An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371.

Given the function `func_1(n)`, it works as follows:
- Converts the input number `n` to a string `num_str` to easily calculate the number of digits.
- Calculates the number of digits `num_len` by getting the length of `num_str`.
- Computes `armstrong_sum` by summing up each digit raised to the power of `num_len`. This is done using a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function.
- Returns `True` if `armstrong_sum` equals the original number `n`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number, and `False` otherwise.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) check the function with known Armstrong and non-Armstrong numbers, which is a good practice for verifying the function's correctness.

**Why the program is correct:**

1. **Accurate Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, which is the defining characteristic of an Armstrong number.
2. **Input Handling**: Although the problem description specifies that the input is a non-negative integer, the function inherently handles this constraint by converting the number to a string and then processing it. Negative numbers would not be correctly handled as their string representation includes a minus sign, but this is not part of the specified input domain.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` for Armstrong numbers and `False` otherwise, as required by the problem description.

**Conclusion**: Given that the function accurately implements the logic to check for Armstrong numbers and adheres to the problem description's requirements for the specified input domain (non-negative integers), it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
