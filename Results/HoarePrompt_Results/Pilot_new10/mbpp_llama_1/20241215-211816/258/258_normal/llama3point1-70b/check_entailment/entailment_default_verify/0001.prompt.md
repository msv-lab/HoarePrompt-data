You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks whether a number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371.

The function works by first converting the input number to a string, then calculating the length of the string (i.e., the number of digits in the number). It then iterates over each digit in the string, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds it to a running sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number, and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

This function appears to be correct for all potential cases. It handles numbers with different numbers of digits correctly, and it correctly identifies Armstrong numbers and non-Armstrong numbers. 

For example, `func_1(371)` returns `True`, because 371 is an Armstrong number (3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371). On the other hand, `func_1(123)` returns `False`, because 123 is not an Armstrong number (1*1*1 + 2*2*2 + 3*3*3 = 32, not 123).

Overall, the function seems to be working correctly for all potential cases, so the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num`, calculates the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num`, and returns `True` if this sum equals `num`, and `False` otherwise, covering all potential cases including edge cases for 0 and single-digit numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
