You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(num)` checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function works by converting the number to a string, calculating the length of the string (i.e., the number of digits), and then iterating over each digit in the string. For each digit, it raises the digit to the power of the number of digits and adds it to a running sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number.

This function appears to handle all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly handles single-digit numbers (e.g., 5, 6), as these are trivially Armstrong numbers.
- It correctly handles multi-digit numbers (e.g., 153, 1634), raising each digit to the correct power and checking for equality with the original number.
- It also handles edge cases, such as numbers with leading zeros (when converted to strings), though the leading zeros do not affect the calculation since they are raised to a power and their contribution to the sum remains 0.

Given the straightforward and accurate implementation of the Armstrong number check, the function is correct for all potential cases, and no counterexamples could be found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num`, calculates the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the number of digits in `num`, and returns `True` if this sum equals `num`, and `False` otherwise, covering all potential cases including edge cases for 0 and single-digit numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
