To understand the output state after the given code snippet is executed, let's consider what the code does: 

- It checks if `sum` (the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of `num_len`, or 0 if `num` is 0) is equal to `num` (the original non-negative integer).

Given that `sum` is the result of raising each digit of `num` to the power of the number of digits in `num` and summing these values (or 0 if `num` is 0), we are comparing this calculated sum to the original number `num`.

The comparison `sum == num` will result in a boolean value: `True` if `sum` equals `num`, and `False` otherwise.

Therefore, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of each digit in `num` raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num` (or 0 if `num` is 0) is equal to the original number `num`.

Output State: **The program returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the sum of each digit in `num` (a non-negative integer) raised to the power of `num_len` (the number of digits in `num`), or 0 if `num` is 0, is equal to `num`.**
