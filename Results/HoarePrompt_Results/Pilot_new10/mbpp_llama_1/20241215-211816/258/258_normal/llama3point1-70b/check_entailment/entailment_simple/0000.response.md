Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description. It correctly checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. It first converts the input number to a string to easily calculate its length (number of digits) and iterate over each digit.
2. It then initializes a sum variable to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
3. The loop iterates over each digit in the number, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds the result to the sum.
4. After the loop, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number and returns True if they are equal, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number, and False otherwise.

This logic correctly implements the definition of an Armstrong number, and the program will work correctly for all non-negative integers.

For example, if the input is 371 (which is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371), the program will calculate the sum as follows:

- Convert 371 to a string and calculate its length: num_str = "371", num_len = 3
- Initialize sum to 0
- Loop:
  - Digit 3: sum += 3^3 = 27
  - Digit 7: sum += 7^3 = 343, sum = 27 + 343 = 370
  - Digit 1: sum += 1^3 = 1, sum = 370 + 1 = 371
- Check if sum (371) is equal to the original number (371): True

Similarly, if the input is 123 (which is not an Armstrong number), the program will calculate the sum as follows:

- Convert 123 to a string and calculate its length: num_str = "123", num_len = 3
- Initialize sum to 0
- Loop:
  - Digit 1: sum += 1^3 = 1
  - Digit 2: sum += 2^3 = 8, sum = 1 + 8 = 9
  - Digit 3: sum += 3^3 = 27, sum = 9 + 27 = 36
- Check if sum (36) is equal to the original number (123): False

The program correctly identifies whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not, and it does so for all non-negative integers.
