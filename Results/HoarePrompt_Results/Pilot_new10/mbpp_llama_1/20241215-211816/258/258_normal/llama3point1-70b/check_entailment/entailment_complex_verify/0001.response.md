The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, which means the assessors believe the function correctly identifies whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. However, upon closer examination of the code and the problem description, there's a critical aspect that needs to be considered.

An Armstrong number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371. The key point here is that the digits are cubed, not raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

The provided code raises each digit to the power of the total number of digits in the number (`num_len`), not to the power of 3 as the definition of an Armstrong number requires. This means the function does not correctly implement the definition of an Armstrong number for numbers with more than 3 digits, as it uses `num_len` as the exponent instead of specifically cubing the digits.

Given this analysis, the original assessment that the function is correct is not accurate. The annotated version of the code helps clarify the function's behavior but also highlights the discrepancy between the function's implementation and the definition of an Armstrong number.

The reason for changing the original assessment is that the code does not accurately implement the logic required to identify Armstrong numbers as per their definition. It incorrectly uses the number of digits in the number as the exponent instead of cubing the digits.

Final: **False**
