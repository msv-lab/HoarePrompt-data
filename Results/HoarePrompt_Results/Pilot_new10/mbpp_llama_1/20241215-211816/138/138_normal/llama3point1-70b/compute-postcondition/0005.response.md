To analyze the provided function `func_1`, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Function Parameters and Return Values**: The function accepts two parameters: `array` and `element`. It returns a tuple containing a boolean value and an integer. The boolean value indicates whether `element` is found in `array`, and the integer is the index of `element` if found, or `-1` if not found.

2. **Functionality Based on Annotations and Code**:
   - The annotations and return postconditions suggest that the function checks if `element` is in `array` and returns `True` along with the index of `element` if it is found. If `element` is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`.
   - The code itself uses the `index()` method of the list to find the index of `element`. If `element` is not in `array`, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError`, which is caught by the `except` block, resulting in the function returning `False` and `-1`.

3. **Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - **Empty Array**: If `array` is empty, calling `array.index(element)` will raise a `ValueError` because `element` cannot be found in an empty list. This case is handled by the `except` block, and the function will correctly return `False` and `-1`.
   - **Multiple Occurrences**: The `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `array`. If `element` appears multiple times in `array`, this function will only return the index of the first occurrence.
   - **Non-List Input**: The function does not check if `array` is actually a list. If `array` is not a list, calling `array.index(element)` may raise an `AttributeError` because not all types have an `index()` method. However, the provided annotations and code do not mention handling such cases.
   - **Comparison**: The function relies on the ability to compare `element` with the elements in `array` using equality (`==`). This comparison might not work as expected for all types of elements (e.g., custom class instances without an overridden `__eq__` method).

Given the above analysis, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `array` and a value `element`, and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is `True` if `element` is found in `array`, and `False` otherwise. The second element of the tuple is the index of `element` in `array` if it is found, or `-1` if not found. This function handles the case where `element` is not in `array` but does not explicitly handle cases where `array` is not a list or where `element` appears multiple times in `array`. **
