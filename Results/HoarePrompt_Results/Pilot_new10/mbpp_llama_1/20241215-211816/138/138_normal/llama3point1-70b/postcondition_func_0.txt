The function accepts a list `array` and a value `element`, and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is `True` if `element` is found in `array`, and `False` otherwise. The second element of the tuple is the index of `element` in `array` if it is found, or `-1` if not found. This function handles the case where `element` is not in `array` but does not explicitly handle cases where `array` is not a list or where `element` appears multiple times in `array`.
