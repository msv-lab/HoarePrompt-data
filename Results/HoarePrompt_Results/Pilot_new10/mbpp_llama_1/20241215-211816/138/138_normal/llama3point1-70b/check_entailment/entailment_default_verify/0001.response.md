Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment that the program is correct.

The problem description specifies that the function should return a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if not found). The provided code meets this requirement by using the built-in `index()` method of Python lists to find the index of the given element. If the element is found, the function returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found, the function catches the `ValueError` exception raised by the `index()` method and returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`.

The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected. It correctly returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element if the element is found in the array, and a tuple with `False` and `-1` if the element is not found.

One potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that the function does not explicitly handle cases where `array` is not a list or where `element` appears multiple times in `array`. However, as noted in the original assessment, the problem description implicitly assumes valid input, and the function will work correctly if the user provides a valid list and element.

Regarding the case where `element` appears multiple times in `array`, the `index()` method will return the index of the first occurrence of the element, which is a reasonable behavior given the problem description.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints.

Final: **True**
