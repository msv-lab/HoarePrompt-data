Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters: `array` and `element`. This aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should take in an array and an element.

2. The function attempts to find the index of the `element` in the `array` using the `index` method. If the `element` is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the `element`. This matches the problem description's requirement to return a boolean indicating the presence of the element and its index position.

3. If the `element` is not found in the `array`, the `index` method raises a `ValueError`, which is caught by the `except` block. In this case, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`, indicating that the `element` is not found and there is no valid index position. This also aligns with the problem description.

4. The function handles all potential cases:
   - The `element` is present in the `array`: The function returns `True` and the correct index.
   - The `element` is not present in the `array`: The function returns `False` and `-1`.
   - The `array` is empty: The `index` method will raise a `ValueError` if the `element` is not found, and the function will return `False` and `-1`.

In conclusion, the provided program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, it is a correct implementation of the problem description.
