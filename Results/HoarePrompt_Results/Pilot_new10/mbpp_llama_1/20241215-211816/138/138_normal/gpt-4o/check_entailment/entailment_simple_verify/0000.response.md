The original assessment and the annotated version of the code indicate that the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. The function iterates over the array, checks if the current value is equal to the target element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The annotated version of the code accurately describes the states of the program at different points. Before the function call, `arr` is a list and `element` is any type of object that can be compared for equality. After the `for` loop has been executed, if `arr` contains `element`, the function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element`; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.

The original assessment correctly identifies the function's behavior and handles all possible cases correctly, including the case when the element is not found in the array.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
