You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct. It meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to return a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's why the program works correctly:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over the input array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and value of each element.
2. If the current element matches the target element, the function immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the current index.
3. If the function completes the iteration without finding a match, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1, indicating that the element is not in the array.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including finding an element at different positions in the array and handling cases where the element is not found. 

After reviewing the program, I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause it to behave incorrectly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared for equality.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list, `element` is any type of object, if `arr` contains `element`, the function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element`; otherwise, it implicitly returns `None`, with `index` and `value` reflecting the last element of `arr` if `arr` is not empty, or their original state if `arr` is empty.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False and -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list and an element, returning a tuple containing True and the index of the element if it exists in the list, or False and -1 if it does not, covering cases for empty lists and lists with duplicate elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
