The original assessment claims that the program is correct, and after reviewing the problem description, the code, and the annotated version, I agree with this assessment. The function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The annotated version of the code provides a clear description of the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, checks for the presence of the target element, and returns the correct tuple based on the outcome. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases.

The only potential issue that could be raised is that the function does not handle the case where the input array is empty. However, the problem description assumes that the input will be valid, and the function behaves correctly according to the problem description. The annotated version also mentions that the function implicitly returns `None` with `index` and `value` reflecting the last element of `arr` if `arr` is not empty, or their original state if `arr` is empty, but this is not a problem since the function explicitly returns `False, -1` in this case.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
