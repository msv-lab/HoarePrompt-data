Postcondition: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is any type of object, `index` is 1, and `value` is the second element in `arr`. If `value` equals `element`, the program returns a boolean value True and the `index` which is 1. Otherwise, the program returns None, with `value` not being equal to `element`.**
