The problem description is to write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

The original assessment is None, indicating no initial judgment on the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code describes the state of the program right before the function call as `arr` being a list of integers with at least two elements, and after the function call, the program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list `arr`.

Given the problem description, the code seems to correctly implement the functionality to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. The maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Therefore, the annotated version of the code supports the idea that the program is correct based on the problem description. Since the original assessment was None, and the annotated version supports the correctness of the program, the final assessment should affirm the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
