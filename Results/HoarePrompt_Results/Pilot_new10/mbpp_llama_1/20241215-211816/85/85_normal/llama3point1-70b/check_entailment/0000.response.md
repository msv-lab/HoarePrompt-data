Correctness: **True**.

The provided program calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum value in the array from the maximum value. This approach is correct because it considers all possible pairs of elements in the array.

Here's why it works for every potential case:

1. **Empty array**: The program will throw an error if the input array is empty, because it tries to find the minimum and maximum values. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, and in Python, it's a common behavior to raise an error when operating on empty sequences. To handle this case, the program could be modified to return a specific value or raise a custom error.

2. **Single-element array**: If the array contains only one element, the function will return 0, which is the correct maximum difference between any two elements in this case (since there's only one element to compare with itself).

3. **Multi-element array**: For arrays with multiple elements, the function will correctly return the maximum difference between any two elements, because it considers the extreme values (minimum and maximum).

4. **Duplicate elements**: The function handles duplicate elements correctly, because it only considers the minimum and maximum values, regardless of how many times they appear.

5. **Negative numbers and zero**: The function also handles negative numbers and zero correctly, because the minimum and maximum functions in Python can handle these values.

6. **Float numbers**: The function can handle float numbers because Python's built-in min and max functions can handle float numbers.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. However, as mentioned earlier, it might be beneficial to add error checking for empty arrays to make the function more robust.
