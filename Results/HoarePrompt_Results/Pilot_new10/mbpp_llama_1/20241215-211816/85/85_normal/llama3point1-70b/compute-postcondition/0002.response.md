The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list. 

Looking at the code, it directly calculates and returns this difference using the built-in `max` and `min` functions in Python. There are no conditional statements or loops, so the function's behavior is straightforward.

However, potential edge cases to consider include:

- An empty list: If the input list is empty, both `max` and `min` will raise a ValueError because they cannot find the maximum or minimum of an empty sequence.
- A list with a single element: In this case, `max` and `min` will return the same value (the single element in the list), resulting in a difference of 0.
- A list containing non-integer values: While the annotation specifies a list of integers, if the list contains non-integer values (like floats or other types), `max` and `min` can still operate on them, and the function will return the difference between the maximum and minimum values of these non-integer values.
- A list with extremely large or small integers: If the list contains very large or very small integers, the subtraction operation could potentially overflow or underflow, though Python's arbitrary-precision arithmetic mitigates this risk for integer operations.

Including these edge cases in the functionality summary:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list. It will raise an error if the list is empty, return 0 if the list contains a single element, and can handle lists with non-integer values or extremely large/small integers, returning the difference between the maximum and minimum values in these cases. **
