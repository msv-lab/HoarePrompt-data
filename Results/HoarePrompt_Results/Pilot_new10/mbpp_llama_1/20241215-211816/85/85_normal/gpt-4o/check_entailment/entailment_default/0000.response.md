Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the given array, which is the definition of the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. 

The provided unit tests also agree with the problem description and the code. For example, in the first test case, the maximum difference between any two elements in the array `(2, 1, 5, 3)` is `5 - 1 = 4`, which is what the function returns.

Additionally, the output hints provide some edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with a single element, which would raise a ValueError when trying to find the minimum or maximum value. However, the code does not explicitly handle these cases, but it will indeed raise a ValueError or return `0` as the difference for a single-element list, which might be considered the correct behavior depending on the problem's specifications.

The code does not handle non-integer values as the output hints suggest, but this does not necessarily make the code incorrect, as the problem description does not explicitly state that the list must only contain integers. The code will still return the correct difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, even if the list contains non-integer values. 

Therefore, based on the provided information, it seems that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
