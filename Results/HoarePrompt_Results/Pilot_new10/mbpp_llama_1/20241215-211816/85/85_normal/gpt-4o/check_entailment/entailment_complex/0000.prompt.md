You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, and returns this difference. If the list is empty or contains a single element, the function will raise a ValueError. If the list contains non-integer values, the function will still calculate and return the difference, but the result may not be meaningful.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
