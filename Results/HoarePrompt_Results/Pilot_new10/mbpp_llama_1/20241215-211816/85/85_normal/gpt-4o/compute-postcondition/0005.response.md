The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. 

Looking at the code, it uses the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the smallest and largest integers in the list, respectively. It then subtracts the minimum value from the maximum value to find the difference. 

However, the code does not include any error checking or handling for edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with a single element. In these cases, the `min` and `max` functions would raise a `ValueError` because they cannot operate on an empty sequence. 

Additionally, the code does not account for non-integer values in the list. If the list contains non-integer values, the `min` and `max` functions would still work, but the result might not be meaningful if the list contains a mix of integers and other types of numbers.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, and returns this difference. If the list is empty or contains a single element, the function will raise a ValueError. If the list contains non-integer values, the function will still calculate and return the difference, but the result may not be meaningful. **
