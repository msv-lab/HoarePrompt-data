Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the array, then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. This approach ensures that the maximum difference is always found, regardless of the order or distribution of the elements in the array.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input cases. The function correctly handles arrays with different lengths, element orders, and ranges, and it produces the expected results for each test case.

In general, the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, because any other pair of elements will have a smaller difference. Therefore, the program's approach of finding the maximum and minimum values and then calculating their difference is a reliable and efficient way to solve the problem. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so the program is correct.
