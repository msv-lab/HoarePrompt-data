Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided Python function, `func_1`, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, which is equivalent to finding the maximum difference between any two elements.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the built-in `min` and `max` functions.
2. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the list.
3. The function returns this difference, which is the desired output according to the problem description.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different input scenarios.

Note that the problem description does not explicitly state what to do if the list contains non-integer values or if the list is empty. However, the function's behavior in these cases is documented in the comments, and it does not affect the correctness of the function with respect to the problem description. If the list contains non-integer values, the function will still calculate and return the difference, and if the list is empty or contains a single element, the function will raise a ValueError, although this is not explicitly handled in the provided code. 

However, in terms of the problem description provided the function does what it is supposed to do. Hence, the program is correct.
