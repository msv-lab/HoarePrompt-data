Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the given array, which aligns with the problem description of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. However, the code does not handle all potential cases as described in the output hints.

One case where the code does not work correctly is when the input list is empty. The output hints mention that if the list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. However, the code does not explicitly handle this case. When an empty list is passed to the `min()` or `max()` function, it raises a ValueErro with a message indicating that the function is being called with an empty sequence. But the code itself does not raise a ValueError explicitly with a meaningful error message; instead, it relies on the built-in behavior of the `min()` and `max()` functions.

Another case where the code might not work as expected is when the list contains non-integer values. The output hints state that the function will still calculate and return the difference, but the result may not be meaningful. While this is technically true, it does not align with typical expectations for such a function, where input validation might be expected to ensure that all elements are indeed numbers (either integers or floats) before proceeding with the calculation.

Lastly, the function does not explicitly check if the input is a list (or in this case, a tuple, as demonstrated in the assertions) or if it contains a single element, as mentioned in the output hints. The function will work incorrectly if the input is not an iterable or if it contains non-comparable elements (like strings and numbers), leading to potential errors that are not explicitly handled.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect according to the provided criteria.
