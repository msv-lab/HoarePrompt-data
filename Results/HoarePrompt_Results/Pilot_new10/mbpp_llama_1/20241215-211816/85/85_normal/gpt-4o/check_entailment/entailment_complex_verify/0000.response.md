To determine the final correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the original assessment, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the input array `arr`.

The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial assessment was made. 

The annotated version of the code describes the state of the program at different points, which matches the problem description and the provided code. It correctly notes that the function calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list and returns this difference.

Based on the analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and returns their difference, which indeed represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Therefore, considering all the information available, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
