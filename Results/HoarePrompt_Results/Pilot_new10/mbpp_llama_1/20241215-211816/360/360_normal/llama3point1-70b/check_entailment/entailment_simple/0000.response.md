Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lists`) as input.
2. The built-in `max` function in Python is used with a `key` argument set to `sum`. This tells `max` to find the maximum element in the `lists` based on the sum of each sublist.
3. The `sum` function returns the sum of all elements in a sublist.
4. The `max` function returns the first sublist that has the maximum sum if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum.

The program always does what the problem description says because it correctly identifies the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements, regardless of the size of the sublists or the input list.

Here's an example to demonstrate the correctness of the program:

```python
lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]
print(func_1(lists))  # Output: [6, 7, 8, 9]
```

In this example, the sum of the elements in each sublist is:

* `[1, 2, 3]`: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
* `[4, 5]`: 4 + 5 = 9
* `[6, 7, 8, 9]`: 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 30

The program correctly returns the sublist `[6, 7, 8, 9]` because it has the maximum sum of its elements (30).
