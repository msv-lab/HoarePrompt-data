To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state. The initial state is that `lists` is a list of lists of numbers. The code snippet is `return max(lists, key=sum)`. 

This code uses the built-in `max` function with a `key` argument set to `sum`. The `max` function returns the item with the maximum value from the `lists` list. The `key` argument specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in `lists`. Since `key` is set to `sum`, the `max` function will return the sublist from `lists` that has the highest sum of its elements.

Given that `lists` is a list of lists of numbers, the code will return one of these sublists that has the maximum sum of its numbers.

Output State: **The program returns a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its numbers.**
