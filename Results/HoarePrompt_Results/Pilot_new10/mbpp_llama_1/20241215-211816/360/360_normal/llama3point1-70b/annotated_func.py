#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists of numbers.
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of lists of numbers and returns a sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers. If the input list is empty, it raises a ValueError. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values.
