Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks for the function to return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. However, the provided function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. 

According to the problem description, if the input list is empty, the function should return an appropriate result (although the problem description does not specify what that result should be). However, in Python, calling `max()` on an empty list raises a `ValueError`. 

To meet the requirements of the problem description, the function should be modified to explicitly handle the case where the input list is empty, for example by raising a `ValueError` with a meaningful error message or by returning a specific value. 

For example, the function could be modified as follows:

```python
def func_1(lists):
    if not lists:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    return max(lists, key=sum)
```

With this modification, the function would meet the requirements of the problem description. However, in its current form, it does not handle the case where the input list is empty correctly. 

It's worth noting that if the problem description specified that the function should raise an error or return a specific value when the input list is empty, and the function was implemented to do so, then the function would be correct. However, based on the provided information, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
