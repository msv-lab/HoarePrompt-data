The original assessment is None, which means no judgment was made about the program's correctness.

However, based on the problem description and the provided code, we can make an assessment. The problem description asks to write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses the built-in `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum`, which returns the list with the maximum sum.

The annotated code confirms this, stating that the program returns a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its numbers, which aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is not inaccurate, but rather, it is incomplete. Based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
