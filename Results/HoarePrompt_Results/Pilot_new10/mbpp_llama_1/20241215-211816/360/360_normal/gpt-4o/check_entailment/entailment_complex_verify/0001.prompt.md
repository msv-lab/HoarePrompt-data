You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list


```
Original Assessment: None

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numbers, and list_of_lists is not empty.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each inner list contains numbers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of elements in any inner list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` is the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.
    return max_list
    #The program returns max_list, which is the inner list with the maximum sum of elements in list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists containing numbers and returns the first inner list it encounters with the maximum sum of elements, handling empty inner lists and assuming all elements are numeric, with a potential TypeError if non-numeric elements are present, and returning an empty list if the input list of lists is empty or all inner lists are empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
