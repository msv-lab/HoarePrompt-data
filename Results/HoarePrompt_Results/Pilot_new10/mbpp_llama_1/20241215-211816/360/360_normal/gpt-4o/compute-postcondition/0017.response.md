Postcondition: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 inner lists, `sublist` is the third inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the third inner list of `list_of_lists`. If `current_sum` is greater than the original `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` and `max_list` is equal to `sublist`.**
