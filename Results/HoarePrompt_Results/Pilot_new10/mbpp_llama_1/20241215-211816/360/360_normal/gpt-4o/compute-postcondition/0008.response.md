According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 2 inner lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 inner list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first inner list of `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 inner lists and the `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`. The `current_sum` will be the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`. If `current_sum` is greater than the current `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` and `max_list` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is either the sum of the elements in the first inner list or remains unchanged, `max_list` is either the first inner list or the second inner list depending on the values**
