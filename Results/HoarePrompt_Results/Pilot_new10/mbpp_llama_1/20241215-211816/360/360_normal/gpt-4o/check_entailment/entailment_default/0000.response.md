Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct, as it iterates through the list of lists, calculates the sum of each sublist, and updates the `max_sum` and `max_list` variables whenever it encounters a sublist with a sum greater than the current maximum sum. This approach ensures that the function returns the list with the highest sum of elements.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function handles empty inner lists, assumes all elements are numeric, and returns an empty list if the input list of lists is empty or all inner lists are empty. However, a potential TypeError could occur if non-numeric elements are present, which is not explicitly addressed in the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness, as it returns the expected results for the given inputs. After reviewing the code, output hints, and unit tests, it appears that the code behaves as intended and handles various potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
