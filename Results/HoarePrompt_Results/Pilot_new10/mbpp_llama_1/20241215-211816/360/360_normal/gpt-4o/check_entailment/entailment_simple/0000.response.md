Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is correct based on the given problem description. The function iterates over each inner list in the `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of elements in each inner list, and keeps track of the maximum sum found so far along with the inner list that produces this maximum sum.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the function is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) and `max_list` to an empty list. This ensures that the first inner list's sum will be greater than `max_sum`, allowing the function to update `max_sum` and `max_list` correctly.

2. **Iteration**: The function then iterates over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`. For each `sublist`, it calculates the `current_sum` of its elements using the built-in `sum()` function.

3. **Update if Necessary**: If `current_sum` is greater than the current `max_sum`, the function updates `max_sum` to `current_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current `sublist`. This ensures that `max_sum` always holds the maximum sum found so far, and `max_list` holds the inner list that produces this maximum sum.

4. **Return**: After iterating over all inner lists, the function returns `max_list`, which holds the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.

This logic correctly implements the problem description. However, there's a potential edge case to consider: if there are multiple inner lists with the same maximum sum, this function will return the first one it encounters. The problem description does not specify how to handle such ties, so this behavior could be considered correct depending on the interpretation. In general, though, the function does what the problem description asks for: it returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

For instance, consider the following example where there are two lists with the maximum sum:
```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [3, 2, 1]]
```
Both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[3, 2, 1]` have the same sum of 6, but the function will return `[1, 2, 3]` because it encounters it first. If the problem description required returning all lists with the maximum sum in case of a tie, the function would need to be adjusted to keep track of all such lists, not just the first one. However, given the current problem description and the provided implementation, the function behaves correctly according to the specified requirements.
