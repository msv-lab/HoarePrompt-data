To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it against the given problem description.

The problem description asks for a function that takes a list and an integer `n` and splits the list for every `n`th element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that does the following:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create `n` sublists from the original list `lst`. Each sublist is a slice of `lst` starting at index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`) with a step size of `n`.

Let's examine how this function handles the problem description's requirements:

1. **Splitting the List for Every `n`th Element**: The function effectively does this by taking slices of the original list with a step size of `n`. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the function returns `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which are the sublists of elements at every `n`th position (considering the start index `i` for each iteration).

2. **Returning a List of Resulting Lists**: The function indeed returns a list of lists, where each inner list is a slice of the original list, thus fulfilling this requirement.

However, there are potential edge cases and considerations:

- **Empty List**: If `lst` is an empty list, the function will return a list of `n` empty lists. This behavior is consistent with the idea of splitting at every `n`th element, even though there are no elements to split.

- **Step Size Exceeding List Length**: If `n` exceeds the length of `lst`, the function will still return a list of lists, but since the step size `n` is larger than the list's length, the resulting sublists will either contain a single element (if the list is long enough) or be empty, depending on the start index `i`. This could potentially be seen as meeting the requirements, albeit with somewhat trivial sublists.

- **Non-Integer or Non-Positive Step Sizes**: The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is not an integer or is not positive. If `n` is a non-integer or a non-positive integer, the function's behavior may not align with typical expectations for such operations (e.g., slicing with a non-integer step size would raise a TypeError, and a non-positive step size would not result in the desired "split every `n`th element" behavior). However, the problem description does specify that `n` is a positive integer, so this does not directly contradict the requirements but points to potential fragility if the input validation is not tightly controlled.

Considering these points, the provided program does indeed meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for the specified conditions (positive integer `n` and list `lst`). It correctly splits the input list at every `n`th element and returns a list of the resulting sublists, handling edge cases like empty lists and large step sizes in a manner consistent with the problem's specifications.

Correctness: **True**
