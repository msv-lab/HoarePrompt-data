The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. According to the code, it returns a list of 'n' sublists, where each sublist is a slice of 'lst' with a step size of 'n'. 

However, the code does not handle cases where 'n' is not a positive integer or where 'lst' is not a list. 

Additionally, the code will return empty sublists if 'lst' is empty or if 'n' is greater than the length of 'lst'. 

So, the functionality of the function is to accept a list and a positive integer, and return a list of sublists where each sublist is a slice of the original list with a specified step size, handling potential edge cases such as empty lists, non-integer or non-positive step sizes, and lists with lengths less than the step size.


Functionality: ** The function accepts a list and a positive integer, and returns a list of sublists where each sublist is a slice of the original list with a specified step size, potentially returning empty sublists if the list is empty or the step size exceeds the list length, and may not handle non-integer or non-positive step sizes correctly **
