Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` as input and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. The function achieves this by creating a list of `n` empty lists and then iterating over the input list, appending each element to the corresponding list based on its index modulo `n`.

The function correctly handles various edge cases, such as:

* Empty input list: The function will return a list of `n` empty lists.
* `n` is 1: The function will return a list containing the original input list.
* `n` is greater than the length of the input list: The function will return a list of `n` lists, with the first `len(lst)` lists containing one element each and the remaining lists empty.
* `n` is a factor of the length of the input list: The function will return a list of `n` lists, each containing the same number of elements.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios.

After analyzing the function and considering different potential cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the function does not work correctly. Therefore, the program is correct, and the given function accurately implements the problem description.
