#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list, `n` is a positive integer, `result` is a list of `n` lists where elements from `lst` are distributed in a round-robin manner, `i` is the last index of `lst` if `lst` is not empty, otherwise it is undefined, `element` is the last element of `lst` if `lst` is not empty, otherwise it is undefined.
    return result
    #The program returns a list of `n` lists where elements from `lst` are distributed in a round-robin manner
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where elements from `lst` are distributed in a round-robin manner. It handles various edge cases, including empty lists and lists of varying lengths relative to `n`, but assumes `n` is a positive integer and does not explicitly handle cases where `n` might be 0 or negative.
