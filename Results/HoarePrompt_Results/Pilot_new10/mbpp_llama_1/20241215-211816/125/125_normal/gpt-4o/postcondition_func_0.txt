The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists where elements from `lst` are distributed in a round-robin manner. It handles various edge cases, including empty lists and lists of varying lengths relative to `n`, but assumes `n` is a positive integer and does not explicitly handle cases where `n` might be 0 or negative.
