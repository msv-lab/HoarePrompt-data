Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into sublists, where every nth element from the original list is placed in the same sublist. The function uses list comprehension to create a list of empty lists, with the number of empty lists determined by the input integer `n`. Then it iterates over the input list, appending each element to the corresponding sublist based on its index modulo `n`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different input cases, including lists of characters, numbers, and strings. The function's logic is sound and handles edge cases, such as when the length of the input list is not a multiple of `n`.

Upon analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I could not find any scenario where the function fails to meet the problem description. The function correctly distributes elements from the input list into sublists based on their position, ensuring that every nth element is grouped together. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
