Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative. In the problem description, it is stated that the function should take in a list and an integer `n` and split the list for every nth element. However, when `n` is 0 or negative, the code will throw an error or produce unexpected results. 

For example, if `n` is 0, the code will throw a `ZeroDivisionError` in the line `result[i % n].append(element)`. If `n` is negative, the code will not distribute the elements correctly, because the modulo operator `%` in Python can return a negative result if the divisor is negative. This can be seen in the following example:

```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -2))  # Expected output: an error or a special value indicating that n is invalid
```

To fix this, the code should add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `n` is a positive integer, and raise an error or return a special value if it is not.

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```
