Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`, as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The function uses the `zip` function to pair each element in the input tuple with the next element.
2. The `zip` function automatically stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted, which in this case is `numbers` and `numbers[1:]`. This ensures that the last element is not paired with anything, avoiding an `IndexError`.
3. The generator expression `(a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` calculates the products of consecutive elements.
4. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which is then returned.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements. If the tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple, which is the correct behavior because there are no consecutive elements to multiply.

Given the problem description and the code, there are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected. The code correctly handles tuples of any length, including those with less than two elements, and returns the expected results. 

For example, if the input is `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the output will be `(2, 6, 12)`, which is correct according to the problem description. If the input is `(1,)`, the output will be `()`, which is also correct because there are no consecutive elements to multiply.
