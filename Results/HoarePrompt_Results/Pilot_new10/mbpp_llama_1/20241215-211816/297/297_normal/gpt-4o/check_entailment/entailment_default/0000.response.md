Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple. The function uses a generator expression to calculate the products and then converts the result to a tuple.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple, and if the input tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple.

The code handles all potential cases, including:

- If the input tuple has two or more elements, it correctly calculates the products of consecutive numbers and returns them as a tuple.
- If the input tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple, which is the expected behavior.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function works as expected for various input tuples.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description, and there are no cases where it does not work as expected.
