Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that removes all whitespaces from a string using the `replace` method. The function takes a string `s` as input and returns the string with all spaces replaced by an empty string, effectively removing them.

The provided unit tests cover various cases, including strings with multiple consecutive whitespaces and leading/trailing whitespaces. The function handles these cases correctly.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the `replace` method in Python replaces all occurrences of the specified value (in this case, a space) in the string. Therefore, the function should correctly remove all whitespaces from the input string, regardless of their position or quantity.

Since the code uses the `replace` method, which is a built-in Python function designed for this purpose, it is likely to work correctly for all potential input cases. I couldn't find any edge cases where the function might not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
