#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns string 's' with all spaces removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns the string with all spaces removed, handling all possible input strings, including empty strings, strings with only spaces, and strings without spaces.
