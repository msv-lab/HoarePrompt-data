Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to remove all whitespaces from a string, but the program only removes spaces (' ') as defined by the `replace(' ', '')` method.

There are other types of whitespace characters in Python, including tabs ('\t'), newlines ('\n'), and carriage returns ('\r'). The `replace(' ', '')` method will not remove these characters, so the program does not fulfill the requirement of removing all whitespaces.

For instance, if the input string is `\tHello\nWorld`, the program will return `\tHello\nWorld` instead of `HelloWorld`, which is the expected output.

To correctly implement the function, you could use the `replace()` method for each type of whitespace character or use regular expressions with the `sub()` method from the `re` module, or use a loop to check for each whitespace character.

However, the most Pythonic way to remove all whitespace characters is to use the `replace()` method in combination with the `split()` and `join()` methods or to use a list comprehension with an `if` condition, but an even simpler way is to use the `str.translate()` method or regular expressions. But there is also a simpler way by using the `str.split()` and `str.join()` functions in combination. However, Python provides an even more straightforward method, the `str.translate()` method or regular expressions. Here's how you could do it:

```python
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '').replace('\t', '').replace('\n', '').replace('\r', '')
```

or 

```python
import re
def func_1(input_str):
    return re.sub(r'\s+', '', input_str)
```

or 

```python
def func_1(input_str):
    return ''.join(input_str.split())
```
This will correctly remove all whitespace characters from the string, not just spaces.
