Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct according to the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `input_str` as an argument and returns the string with all spaces removed. 

This is achieved using the `replace` method, which replaces all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a space `' '`) with another substring (in this case, an empty string `''`). 

Since the problem description asks for a function that removes all whitespaces from a string, and Python's `replace` method with a space character as the first argument does exactly that, the program is correct. 

It's worth noting, however, that the problem description uses the term "whitespaces," which can include other characters besides spaces, such as tabs `\t` or newline characters `\n`. The provided function only removes space characters, not all types of whitespace. If the intent was to remove all whitespace characters, the function would need to be modified, possibly using the `replace` method in combination with other methods or using a regular expression. 

However, based strictly on the information provided and assuming the problem description is taken at face value, with "whitespaces" meaning only space characters, the program meets the requirements.
