Postcondition: **`n` is at least 100, `s` has a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2, and either `i` is not even or `s[i]` is equal to `first_digit`. Since `i` is given as 2, which is an even number, the condition simplifies to `s[2]` being equal to `first_digit`.**
