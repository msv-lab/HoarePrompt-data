The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns `False` for the first 8 cases, and `True` for the 9th case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` or `False` based on certain conditions, with `False` being returned for the majority of cases and `True` only for the last case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer, and returns True for a specific case, and False otherwise.**
