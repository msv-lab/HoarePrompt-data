According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `s`. If `i` is less than the length of `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 100, `s` has a length of at least 4, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4. Also, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, so `s` must have a length of at least 5.

State: **`n` is at least 100, `s` has a length of at least 5, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 4**
