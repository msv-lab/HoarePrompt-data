You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given function checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number where the digits alternate between two numbers. For example, 1212121 is an undulating number because it alternates between 1 and 2.

The function `func_1(n)` works as follows:

- It first converts the number into a string `s`.
- It checks if the length of the string is less than 3, in which case it returns False because an undulating number must have at least three digits to alternate.
- It then checks if the first two digits are the same, in which case it returns False because an undulating number must start with two different digits.
- It then iterates over the rest of the string, checking if the digits at even indices are equal to the first digit and the digits at odd indices are equal to the second digit. If it finds a digit that does not match this pattern, it returns False.
- If it checks all the digits and finds that they follow the undulating pattern, it returns True.

The function seems to correctly implement the logic to check for an undulating number, and it handles all the potential cases. It correctly returns True for numbers like 1212121 and 121, and it correctly returns False for numbers like 1991.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function, as they show that it returns the expected results for different inputs. Therefore, based on the given function and the problem description, it appears that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a positive integer n, checks if its string representation has a length of at least 3, and if the first and second digits are different. Then it checks if every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the first digit, and every odd-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the second digit. If all these conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
