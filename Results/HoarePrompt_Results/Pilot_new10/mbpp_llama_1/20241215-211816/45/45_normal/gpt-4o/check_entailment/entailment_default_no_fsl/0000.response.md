Correctness: **True**

The given code meets the requirements of the problem description as it checks if the provided number is undulating or not. An undulating number is one where every even-indexed digit (starting from index 0) is equal to the first digit, and every odd-indexed digit (starting from index 1) is equal to the second digit. 

The code correctly handles the following cases:

1. It checks if the input number has a length of at least 3, and immediately returns False if it does not.
2. It checks if the first and second digits are different, returning False if they are not, as required by the problem description.
3. It then iterates through the rest of the digits in the number, checking that every even-indexed digit is equal to the first digit and every odd-indexed digit is equal to the second digit. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further demonstrate that the function works as expected in various scenarios. 

For instance, the test `assert func_1(1212121) == True` ensures that the function correctly identifies an undulating number. The test `assert func_1(1991) == False` verifies that the function can distinguish between undulating and non-undulating numbers. The test `assert func_1(121) == True` checks that the function handles short sequences correctly.

Given the logic of the code and the test cases, it appears that the code correctly handles every potential case as per the problem description.
