Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly checks whether the given number is undulating or not. It first checks if the length of the string representation of the number is at least 3 and if the first and second digits are different. Then it checks if every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the first digit, and every odd-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the second digit. If all these conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(1212121) == True` and `assert func_1(121) == True`, also suggest that the function is working as expected for both longer and shorter undulating numbers. The output hints agree with the code and there are no cases where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
