The function accepts a positive integer n, checks if its string representation has a length of at least 3, and if the first and second digits are different. Then it checks if every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the first digit, and every odd-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the second digit. If all these conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
