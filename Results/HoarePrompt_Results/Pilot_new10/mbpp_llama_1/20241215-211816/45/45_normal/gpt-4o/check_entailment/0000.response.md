Correctness: **True**.

The given function checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number where the digits alternate between two numbers. For example, 1212121 is an undulating number because it alternates between 1 and 2.

The function `func_1(n)` works as follows:

- It first converts the number into a string `s`.
- It checks if the length of the string is less than 3, in which case it returns False because an undulating number must have at least three digits to alternate.
- It then checks if the first two digits are the same, in which case it returns False because an undulating number must start with two different digits.
- It then iterates over the rest of the string, checking if the digits at even indices are equal to the first digit and the digits at odd indices are equal to the second digit. If it finds a digit that does not match this pattern, it returns False.
- If it checks all the digits and finds that they follow the undulating pattern, it returns True.

The function seems to correctly implement the logic to check for an undulating number, and it handles all the potential cases. It correctly returns True for numbers like 1212121 and 121, and it correctly returns False for numbers like 1991.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function, as they show that it returns the expected results for different inputs. Therefore, based on the given function and the problem description, it appears that the function is correct.
