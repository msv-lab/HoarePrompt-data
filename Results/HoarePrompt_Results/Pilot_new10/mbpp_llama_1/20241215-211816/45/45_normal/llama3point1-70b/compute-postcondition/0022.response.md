The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and converts it to a string. It then checks all sequences of three adjacent digits in the string representation of `n` to see if they are in ascending or descending order. If all sequences of three adjacent digits are in ascending or descending order, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The function handles sequences of three adjacent digits correctly but does not account for cases where the input integer `n` has fewer than three digits. In such cases, the function will return `True` because the loop that checks for ascending or descending order will not be executed (since `range(1, len(n) - 1)` will be empty), and the variable `undulating` will remain `True`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function includes:

- Returning `True` if all sequences of three adjacent digits in the string representation of `n` are in ascending or descending order.
- Returning `False` if any sequence of three adjacent digits in the string representation of `n` is not in ascending or descending order.
- Returning `True` for input integers with fewer than three digits, since no sequences of three adjacent digits exist to check.

Functionality: ** The function checks if all sequences of three adjacent digits in the string representation of a positive integer are in ascending or descending order, returning True if they are and False otherwise, and returns True for integers with fewer than three digits. **
