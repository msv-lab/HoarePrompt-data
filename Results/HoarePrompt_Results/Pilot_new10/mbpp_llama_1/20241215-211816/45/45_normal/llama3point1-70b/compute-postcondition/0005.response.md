Postcondition: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `undulating` is `True`, `i` is 1, and it is not the case that ((`n` at index `i-1` is less than `n` at index `i` and `n` at index `i` is less than `n` at index `i+1`) or (`n` at index `i-1` is greater than `n` at index `i` and `n` at index `i` is greater than `n` at index `i+1`)), meaning that either (`n` at index `i-1` is less than or equal to `n` at index `i` or `n` at index `i` is greater than or equal to `n` at index `i+1`) and (`n` at index `i-1` is greater than or equal to `n` at index `i` or `n` at index `i` is less than or equal to `n` at index `i+1`)**
