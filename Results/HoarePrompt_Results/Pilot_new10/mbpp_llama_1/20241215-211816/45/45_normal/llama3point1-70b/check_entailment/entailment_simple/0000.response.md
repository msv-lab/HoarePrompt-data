Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the given number is undulating or not. 

An undulating number is a number where all sequences of three adjacent digits are either in ascending or descending order. 

The function `func_1(n)` works as follows:
- It converts the input number `n` to a string.
- It then iterates over the string from the second character to the second last character (inclusive).
- For each character, it checks if the current character is part of an ascending or descending sequence with its neighboring characters. If it finds a sequence that is neither ascending nor descending, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
- If the function iterates over all characters without finding any non-undulating sequence, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:
- Single-digit numbers: Although the function does not explicitly handle single-digit numbers, the loop condition `range(1, len(n) - 1)` ensures that the function returns `True` for these numbers, since there are no sequences of three adjacent digits.
- Two-digit numbers: Similarly, the function returns `True` for two-digit numbers, since there are no sequences of three adjacent digits.
- Numbers with three or more digits: The function correctly checks all sequences of three adjacent digits in these numbers.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a given number is undulating or not, as specified in the problem description.
