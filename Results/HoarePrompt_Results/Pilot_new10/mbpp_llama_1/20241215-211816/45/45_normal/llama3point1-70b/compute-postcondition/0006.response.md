The code sets `undulating` to `False`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `undulating` is `False`, `i` is 1, and it is not the case that ((`n` at index `i-1` is less than `n` at index `i` and `n` at index `i` is less than `n` at index `i+1`) or (`n` at index `i-1` is greater than `n` at index `i` and `n` at index `i` is greater than `n` at index `i+1`))**
