Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 5, `i` is 3. If the digits at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are either in ascending or descending order, then `undulating` remains either `True` or `False`. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
