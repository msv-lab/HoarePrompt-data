Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same.

Here's why it works:

- The `set(s)` expression converts the string `s` into a set of unique characters. If all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one character.
- The `len(set(s)) == 1` condition checks if the length of the set (i.e., the number of unique characters) is equal to 1. If this condition is true, it means all characters in the string are the same.

For example, if `s = "aaaa"`, then `set(s) = {'a'}` and `len(set(s)) = 1`, so the function returns `True`. On the other hand, if `s = "abc"`, then `set(s) = {'a', 'b', 'c'}` and `len(set(s)) = 3`, so the function returns `False`.

This solution handles all potential cases, including:

- Empty strings: `set('')` is an empty set, and `len(set(''))` is 0, so the function correctly returns `False` (since an empty string does not contain all the same characters).
- Single-character strings: `set('a')` is `{'a'}`, and `len(set('a'))` is 1, so the function correctly returns `True`.
- Strings with repeated characters: As shown in the example above, the function correctly returns `True` if all characters are the same and `False` otherwise.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description and handles all possible cases.
