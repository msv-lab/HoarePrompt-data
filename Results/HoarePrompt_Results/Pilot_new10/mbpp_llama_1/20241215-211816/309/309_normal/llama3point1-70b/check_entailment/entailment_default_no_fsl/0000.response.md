Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, it does not account for the case where the input `s` is `None` or a non-string type. If `s` is `None`, the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to convert it to a set. If `s` is a non-string type, such as an integer or a list, the function may also raise a `TypeError` or produce incorrect results.

For example, if `s = None`, the function will raise a `TypeError`:

```
func_1(None)  # Raises TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
```

And if `s = 123`, the function will raise a `TypeError` as well:

```
func_1(123)  # Raises TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```

To make the function correct for all potential cases, it should include input validation to ensure that `s` is a string. 

Here's a revised version of the function with input validation:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if not isinstance(s, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string")
    return len(set(s)) == 1
```
