Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(s)` is designed to check whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same or not. The function uses the `set` data structure, which automatically removes duplicates from a collection.

Here's how it works:

1. The function converts the input string `s` into a set of characters.
2. It then checks if the length of this set is equal to 1. If it is, that means there was only one unique character in the string, so all characters are the same.

This approach correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- Empty strings: `len(set(s))` would be 0, which is not equal to 1, so the function correctly identifies that not all characters are the same (although in an empty string, there are no characters).
- Strings with a single character: `len(set(s))` would be 1, so the function correctly identifies that all characters are the same.
- Strings with multiple different characters: `len(set(s))` would be greater than 1, so the function correctly identifies that not all characters are the same.
- Strings with multiple instances of the same character: `len(set(s))` would be 1, so the function correctly identifies that all characters are the same.

Since this function handles all potential cases as described in the problem without any exceptions or errors, it is considered correct.
