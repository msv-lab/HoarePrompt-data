The original assessment is None, so there is no existing assessment to compare with. However, we can evaluate the program based on the problem description and the output hints.

The problem description requires a function to check whether all characters in a given string are the same or not. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same (or if the string is empty) and `False` otherwise.

The output hints match the problem description, indicating that the function should return `True` for an empty string or a string with all identical characters, and `False` for a string with diverse characters.

After reviewing the code and the output hints, it appears that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It handles the edge case where the input string is empty and correctly checks for uniformity of characters in non-empty strings.

Final: **True**
