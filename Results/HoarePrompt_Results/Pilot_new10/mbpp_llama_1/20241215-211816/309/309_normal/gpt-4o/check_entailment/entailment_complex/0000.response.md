Correctness: **False** 

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to check whether all the characters in a given string are the same or not. However, the program returns True for an empty string, which is not in line with the problem description.

The problem description implies that the function should return True only if all characters in the string are the same, and False otherwise. But the program returns True for an empty string, which does not have any characters to compare.

For example, if the input string is '', the program will return True, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The correct output for an empty string should be False, as there are no characters to compare.

The function should be modified to return False for an empty string, or the problem description should be updated to include the case of an empty string. 

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if not s:
        return False
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char!= first_char:
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected function will return False for an empty string, and True only if all characters in the string are the same.
