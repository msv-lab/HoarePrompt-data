#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a string, and s is not empty
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string where all characters are the same, `first_char` is the character that all characters in `s` are equal to, and if the loop completes without returning `False`, `char` is equal to `first_char` and is the last character of `s`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if the string is empty or all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. It assumes the input is a string and does not handle potential exceptions.
