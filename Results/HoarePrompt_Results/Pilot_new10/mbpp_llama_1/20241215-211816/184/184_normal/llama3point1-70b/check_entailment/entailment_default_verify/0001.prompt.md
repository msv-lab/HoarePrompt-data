You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to filter odd numbers from a given list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the numbers for which `num % 2!= 0`, which is the condition for a number to be odd.

This function correctly handles various potential cases:
1. **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function will return an empty list `[]`, which is the expected output since there are no odd numbers to filter.
2. **List with Only Even Numbers**: If the input list contains only even numbers, the function will correctly return an empty list, as there are no odd numbers to include.
3. **List with Only Odd Numbers**: Conversely, if the input list contains only odd numbers, the function will return the original list, as all numbers are odd and should be included in the output.
4. **List with Mixed Numbers**: For a list containing both even and odd numbers, the function will correctly filter out the even numbers, returning a list that includes only the odd numbers.

Given the provided function and considering the various potential cases, it appears to correctly implement the described functionality without any discernible edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, returns a list of odd integers from the input list, and handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only even numbers by returning an empty list, but may raise errors or behave unexpectedly with non-integer values or None input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
