You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. If a number `num` is odd (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`), it is included in the output list.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns an empty list, as expected.
- Lists with only even numbers: `func_1([2, 4, 6])` returns an empty list, as expected.
- Lists with only odd numbers: `func_1([1, 3, 5])` returns the list `[1, 3, 5]`, as expected.
- Lists with a mix of even and odd numbers: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns the list `[1, 3, 5]`, as expected.
- Lists with negative numbers: `func_1([-1, -2, -3])` returns the list `[-1, -3]`, as expected.
- Lists with floating-point numbers: `func_1([1.5, 2.5, 3.5])` returns the list `[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]`, as expected.

The function does not handle non-numeric inputs, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. If the problem description were to include non-numeric inputs, the function would need to be modified to handle such cases. However, based on the provided problem description and the code, the function works correctly for all potential cases involving numeric inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd integers from the 'nums' list


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
