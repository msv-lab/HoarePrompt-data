Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle every potential case as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` does not check if the input is a list or if the list elements are integers. If the input is `None` or a non-list, or if the list contains non-integer values, the function may raise errors or behave unexpectedly.

For example, if the input is `None`, the function will raise a `TypeError` because it tries to iterate over `None`. Similarly, if the list contains non-integer values, such as strings or floats, the function may also raise errors or return incorrect results.

To fix this, the function should add input validation to ensure that it only accepts lists of integers and handles non-integer values and `None` input correctly. 

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle these cases:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not isinstance(nums, list):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a list")
    return [num for num in nums if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2!= 0]
```

This modified function checks if the input is a list and only includes integer values in the output list. If the input is not a list, it raises a `ValueError`.
