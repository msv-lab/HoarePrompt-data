To understand the functionality of the given function `func_1`, let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step.

1. **Function Parameters and Return Type**: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` as its parameter. It returns a list of integers.

2. **Functionality Based on Annotations**: The annotations suggest that the function filters the input list `nums` to return a new list containing only the odd integers from `nums`.

3. **Code Analysis**: The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the numbers `num` from `nums` where `num % 2!= 0`. This condition (`num % 2!= 0`) is true for odd numbers because the remainder of dividing an odd number by 2 is not 0.

4. **Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - **Empty List**: If `nums` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list because there are no numbers to filter.
   - **List with No Odd Numbers**: If `nums` contains only even numbers, the function will return an empty list.
   - **List with Non-Integer Values**: Although the annotations specify that `nums` is a list of integers, the code will still execute if `nums` contains non-integer values. For non-integer values, the condition `num % 2!= 0` might behave unexpectedly or raise an error, depending on the type of non-integer value. For example, if `num` is a float, the condition will work as expected, returning True for odd floats (like 3.0) and False for even floats (like 4.0), but the result might not be practically useful in this context. If `num` is not a number (e.g., a string, boolean), attempting to use the modulus operator (`%`) will raise a TypeError.
   - **Null or None Input**: The function does not explicitly handle the case where `nums` is `None`. Passing `None` to the function will result in a TypeError when the function attempts to iterate over `nums`.

5. **Conclusion on Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list. It handles potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only even numbers by returning an empty list. However, the function may not behave as expected or may raise errors if the input list contains non-integer values or if the input is `None`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, returns a list of odd integers from the input list, and handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only even numbers by returning an empty list, but may raise errors or behave unexpectedly with non-integer values or None input. **
