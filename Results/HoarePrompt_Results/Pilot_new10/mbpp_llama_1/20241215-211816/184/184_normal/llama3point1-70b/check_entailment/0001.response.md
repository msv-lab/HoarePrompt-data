Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to filter odd numbers from a given list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the numbers for which `num % 2!= 0`, which is the condition for a number to be odd.

This function correctly handles various potential cases:
1. **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list `[]`, the function will return an empty list `[]`, which is the expected output since there are no odd numbers to filter.
2. **List with Only Even Numbers**: If the input list contains only even numbers, the function will correctly return an empty list, as there are no odd numbers to include.
3. **List with Only Odd Numbers**: Conversely, if the input list contains only odd numbers, the function will return the original list, as all numbers are odd and should be included in the output.
4. **List with Mixed Numbers**: For a list containing both even and odd numbers, the function will correctly filter out the even numbers, returning a list that includes only the odd numbers.

Given the provided function and considering the various potential cases, it appears to correctly implement the described functionality without any discernible edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
