The original assessment states that the program is correct, and based on the provided code and problem description, this assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers using a list comprehension and the modulo operator. 

However, the output hints mention that the function may raise a TypeError if the input list contains non-integer values. This is a potential issue that was not considered in the original assessment. But since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this issue does not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem description.

The reason why the original assessment is accurate is that the program correctly solves the problem as stated. The problem description asks for a function to filter odd numbers, and the program does exactly that. The program's correctness is further demonstrated by the provided assertions, which show that the function works correctly for various test cases.

Final: **True**
