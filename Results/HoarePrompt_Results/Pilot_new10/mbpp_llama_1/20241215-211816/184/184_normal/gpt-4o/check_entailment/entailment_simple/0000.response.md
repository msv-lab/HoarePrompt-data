Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns a list of odd integers from `nums`.

Here's why the program is correct:

- The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the input list `nums`.
- For each number, it checks the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is true if the number is odd (since an odd number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2).
- If the condition is true, the number is included in the output list; otherwise, it is skipped.
- The function returns the resulting list of odd numbers.

This implementation correctly filters out even numbers and returns a list of only the odd numbers from the input list, which aligns with the problem description.

For example, given the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the function correctly returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are the odd numbers in the input list.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input scenarios. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the implementation, the program is correct.
