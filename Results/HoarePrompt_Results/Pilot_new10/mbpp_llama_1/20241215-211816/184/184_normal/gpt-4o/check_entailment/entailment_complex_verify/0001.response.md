The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is correct, and upon reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, this assessment appears to be accurate.

The function is designed to filter out odd numbers from a list of integers, and it correctly does so by utilizing a list comprehension with the condition `num % 2!= 0`. This condition accurately identifies odd numbers, as a number is odd if and only if it leaves a remainder when divided by 2.

The provided assertions demonstrate that the function correctly handles various test cases, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers.

The annotated version of the code also confirms that the function returns a list of odd integers from the input list `nums`, which aligns with the problem description.

The annotation notes that the function "may raise a TypeError if the input list contains non-integer values," but since we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the information available, the original assessment that the function is correct appears to be accurate.

Final: **True**
