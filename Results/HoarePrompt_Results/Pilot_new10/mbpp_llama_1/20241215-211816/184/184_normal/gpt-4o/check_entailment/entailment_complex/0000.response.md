Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that by using a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers from the input list `nums` that satisfy the condition `num % 2!= 0`, which is true for odd numbers.

The function handles various cases as demonstrated by the assertions:

1. It filters odd numbers from a list of mixed integers.
2. It filters odd numbers from a list that starts with even numbers.
3. It filters odd numbers from a list that contains a mix of odd and even numbers in any order.

Additionally, the function implicitly handles the case of an empty list by returning an empty list, as the list comprehension will simply return an empty list if the input list is empty.

The only potential issue mentioned in the annotations is that the function may raise a TypeError if the input list contains non-integer values. However, the problem description does not explicitly require the function to handle non-integer values, and the function's behavior is well-defined for lists of integers, which is the specified input type.

Therefore, the program is correct because it consistently filters odd numbers from lists of integers as required by the problem description.
