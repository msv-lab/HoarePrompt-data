Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input list contains non-integer values. According to the output hints, it may raise a TypeError in this case. The problem description does not mention this edge case, and the code should ideally handle it by either filtering out non-integer values or raising a meaningful error. For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, '3', 4, 5]`, the code will raise a TypeError when it tries to calculate `'3' % 2`. To make the code correct, it should add a check to handle non-integer values, such as filtering them out or raising a ValueError with a meaningful message. 

Here is an example of how the code can be modified to handle this case:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2!= 0]
```

This modified code will filter out non-integer values from the input list and only return the odd integers.
