To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial conditions.

Given:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`.
- `i` is greater than 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

However, the code snippet does not specify the value of `j`. For the purpose of analysis, we will assume that `j` is an index that has been previously defined and is less than `i`, given the context that `dp[i]` is being compared and potentially updated with `dp[j] + 1`. This kind of operation is typical in dynamic programming problems where the value at a current position is updated based on previous positions.

The impact of the code on the program is the potential update of `dp[i]`. The value of `dp[i]` will be set to the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This implies that if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the current `dp[i]`, then `dp[i]` will be increased by at least 1 (or more, depending on the difference between `dp[j]` and `dp[i]`).

Given the initial conditions:
- The sorted list `nums` and its properties remain unchanged as the code snippet does not modify `nums`.
- The length and initial contents of `dp` remain unchanged, but the value at index `i` may be updated.
- The value of `i` remains the same as the code does not modify it.

Since `i` is greater than 1, and assuming `j` is a valid index less than `i`, we can conclude that `dp[i]` will hold the maximum value it can achieve based on the comparison with `dp[j] + 1`. Without the exact value of `j`, we can't determine the exact value of `dp[i]`, but we know it is updated to be at least as large as `dp[j] + 1` if that value is larger than its current value.

Thus, the output state reflects the update of `dp[i]` and maintains the initial conditions for `nums` and `i`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, `i` is greater than 1**.
