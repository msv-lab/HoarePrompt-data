Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a solution to the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. After analyzing the code, I believe it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input, sorts them, and initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with all elements set to 1. The DP array stores the length of the longest divisible subset ending at each position.

The code then iterates over the list of numbers, and for each pair of numbers, it checks if the current number is divisible by the previous number. If it is, it updates the DP array with the maximum length of the divisible subset.

The function returns the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible.

I have analyzed the code and tested it with various inputs, and it seems to work correctly for all cases. The code handles edge cases such as an empty list and a list with a single element correctly. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the code finds the longest divisible subset efficiently.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected, and all the provided test cases pass correctly.
