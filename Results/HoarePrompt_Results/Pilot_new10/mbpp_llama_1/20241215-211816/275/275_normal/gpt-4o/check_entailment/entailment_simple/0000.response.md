Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem description asks to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
2. The program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. It first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order.
3. It then creates a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors for `nums[i]`.
4. The program iterates over the list of numbers, and for each number `nums[i]`, it checks all previous numbers `nums[j]` to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, it updates `dp[i]` with the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
5. Finally, the program returns the maximum value in the `dp` table, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list.

This approach ensures that the program finds the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible. The use of dynamic programming allows the program to efficiently explore all possible subsets and find the largest one that meets the condition.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For example, the test `assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4` shows that the program correctly finds the largest subset `[1, 3, 6, 18]` where every pair is divisible.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the problem description because it uses a sound dynamic programming approach to find the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible.
