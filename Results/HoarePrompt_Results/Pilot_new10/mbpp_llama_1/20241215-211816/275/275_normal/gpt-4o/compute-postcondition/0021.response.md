Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and has at least one more element than the previous `nums`. The current value of `nums` has a length greater than the previous `nums`. `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`. `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`, `j` is 0.***
