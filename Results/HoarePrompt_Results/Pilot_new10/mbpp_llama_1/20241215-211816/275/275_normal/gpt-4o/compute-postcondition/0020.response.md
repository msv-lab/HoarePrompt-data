The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, this update reflects the possibility of extending the chain of divisors ending at `nums[j]` by appending `nums[i]`. 

Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`, and `j` is 0, after the execution, `dp[i]` will be either its previous value or `dp[j] + 1`, whichever is larger. The other elements of `nums` and `dp`, as well as the values of `i` and `j`, are not directly affected by this operation. However, the relation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` (where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`) and the fact that `nums` has at least one more element than the previous `nums` and its current length is greater than the previous `nums`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and has at least one more element than the previous `nums`. The current value of `nums` has a length greater than the previous `nums`. `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, with `dp[i]` being the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`. `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`, `j` is 0. The current value of `nums` at index `i` is divisible by the current value of `nums` at index `j`.**
