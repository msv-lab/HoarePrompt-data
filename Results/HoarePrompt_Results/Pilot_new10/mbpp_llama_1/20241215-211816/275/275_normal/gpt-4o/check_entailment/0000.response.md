Correctness: **True**.

The provided code correctly finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. It uses dynamic programming to achieve this. 

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, since an empty list has no subsets.

2. The list `nums` is then sorted in ascending order. This is done to ensure that for every pair of numbers in the list, the smaller number comes first.

3. A list `dp` is created, where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest subset that ends with `nums[i]`. The list `dp` is initialized with all elements set to 1, since a single number is always a subset of size 1.

4. The function then iterates over the list `nums`. For each number `nums[i]`, it checks all previous numbers `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it means that `nums[i]` can be appended to the subset that ends with `nums[j]`. In this case, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j]` plus 1.

5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the size of the largest subset that meets the condition.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. The use of dynamic programming ensures that the code has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the code, as it returns the expected results for different input cases. 

Therefore, the code is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
