According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range of `i`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again for the next `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be greater than 1 because `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `i-1`. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, `i` is greater than 1**
