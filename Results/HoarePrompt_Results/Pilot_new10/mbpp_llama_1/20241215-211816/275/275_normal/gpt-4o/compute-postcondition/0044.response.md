The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns either 0 or the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list `nums`. The function first checks if the list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order and initializes a list `dp` with the same length as `nums`, where each element is set to 1. Then, it iterates over the list `nums` and for each number, it checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any of them. If it is, it updates the corresponding element in `dp` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of the previous number's divisor chain length plus 1. Finally, it returns the maximum value in `dp`, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list `nums`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and returns 0 if the list is empty, or the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list, where a chain of divisors is defined as a sequence of numbers where each number is divisible by the previous number in the sequence **
