According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and has at least one more element than the previous `nums`. The current value of `nums` has a length greater than the previous `nums`. `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`. `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`, `j` is 1**
