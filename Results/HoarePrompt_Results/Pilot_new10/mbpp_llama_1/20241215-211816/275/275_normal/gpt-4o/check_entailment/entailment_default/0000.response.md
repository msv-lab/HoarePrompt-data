Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the list. A chain of divisors is defined as a sequence of numbers where each number is divisible by the previous number in the sequence. 

The code first checks if the input list is empty and returns 0 if it is. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order. It uses dynamic programming to find the longest chain of divisors. For each number in the list, it checks all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any of them. If it is, it updates the length of the longest chain of divisors for the current number.

The output hints agree with the code and help prove that the code is correct. The hints state that the function returns the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list, which is exactly what the code does.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code. For example, in the test case `assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4`, the longest chain of divisors is (1, 3, 6, 18), which has a length of 4, and the function correctly returns 4. 

Overall, the code seems to be correct and should work for every potential case as described in the problem description.
