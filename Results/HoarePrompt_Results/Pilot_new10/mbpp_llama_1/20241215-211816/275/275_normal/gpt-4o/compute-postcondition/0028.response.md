To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```
From the output states, we can see that:

* `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and has at least one more element than the previous `nums`.
* `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`.
* If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.
* `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables will be:

* `nums` will still be a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and has at least one more element than the original `nums`.
* `dp` will contain the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`. For each `nums[i]`, `dp[i]` will be the maximum length of the chain of divisors that can be formed using the numbers in `nums` that are less than or equal to `nums[i]`.
* `i` will be equal to the length of the current `nums` minus 1, since the loop iterates over the range of `i`, which is the length of the previous `nums`.
* If the loop does not execute (i.e., the original `nums` has only one element), `dp` will contain the original values, and `i` will be 0.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and has at least one more element than the original `nums`. `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, where `dp[i]` is the maximum length of the chain of divisors that can be formed using the numbers in `nums` that are less than or equal to `nums[i]`. `i` is equal to the length of the current `nums` minus 1.**
