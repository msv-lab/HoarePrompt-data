According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` equals the length of `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `nums`, so `i` should be increased is not possible because it is already at the end, but we can think about what the state should be for the next iteration if it were to happen. 
Since `i` is the length of `nums` and we are thinking about the next iteration, `i` should be the length of `nums` minus one for the loop to execute one more time before this state, but since `i` equals the length of `nums`, we should think about what should be the state before this state for the loop to execute one more time, so `i` should be the length of `nums` minus one. 
Also, if `i` is the length of `nums` minus one, the `nums` list must have at least the length of `nums` elements for `i` to be the length of `nums` minus one.
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty and must have at least the length of the previous `nums` + 1 elements, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, `i` equals the length of the previous `nums`**
