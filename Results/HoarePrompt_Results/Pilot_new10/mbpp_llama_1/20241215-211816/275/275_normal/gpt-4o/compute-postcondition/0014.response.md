To determine the impact of the code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` on the program, let's consider the initial state and how this line of code affects the variables involved.

Given:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`.
- `i` is greater than 2.

The line of code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. However, the value of `j` is not specified in the given initial state or code snippet, so we will consider the general case where `j` could be any valid index related to `i` or `nums`.

The updated value of `dp[i]` depends on the comparison between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. If `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the current `dp[i]`, then `dp[i]` will be updated to `dp[j] + 1`; otherwise, its value remains unchanged.

Since `nums` is sorted in ascending order and is not empty, and without knowing the exact relationship or values within `dp` or how `i` and `j` relate to each other or to `nums`, we can't determine an exact new value for `dp[i]`. However, we can say that the update operation does not change the fact that `nums` is a sorted list of integers or that `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`. The value of `i` being greater than 2 also remains unchanged as `i` is not modified in the given code.

Therefore, considering all the information provided and the operation performed, the output state includes the updated value of `dp[i]`, which is now the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, while the other conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, `i` is greater than 2.**
