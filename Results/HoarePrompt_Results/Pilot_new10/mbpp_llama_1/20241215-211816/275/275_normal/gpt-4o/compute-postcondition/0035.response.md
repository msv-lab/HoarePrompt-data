To calculate the result, we first note that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `i` is greater than 1, and `j` is 0. The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp` reflects the chains of divisors up to the current `i`, this update means that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then the maximum chain length at `i` is updated if a longer chain is found through `j`.

Given the initial state conditions, especially the condition regarding divisibility and the update of `dp[i]`, we consider the scenario where `nums[i]` is indeed divisible by `nums[j]`. The update `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` means that `dp[i]` will take on the value of `dp[j] + 1` if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the current `dp[i]`. This indicates an extension of the divisor chain by one more element, from `j` to `i`, because `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

The output state, considering the given initial conditions and the code's effect, is as follows:

- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.
- `i` remains greater than 1.
- `j` remains 0.
- `dp[i]` is updated to reflect the maximum chain of divisors, which is now `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, essentially `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` and this new value is greater than the previous `dp[i]`.

Considering all information:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, reflecting the updated chain of divisors if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
