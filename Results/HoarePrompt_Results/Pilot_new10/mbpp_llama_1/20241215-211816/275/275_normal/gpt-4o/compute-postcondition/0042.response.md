To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors for `nums[i]`.

The code snippet is `return max(dp)`. This means the program will return the maximum value found in the `dp` list.

Given that `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, the maximum value in `dp` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in `nums`.

Therefore, the program returns the length of the longest chain of divisors found in the list `nums`, which is the maximum value in the `dp` list.

Output State: **The program returns the length of the longest chain of divisors among all numbers in the sorted list 'nums'.**
