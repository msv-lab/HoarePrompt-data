Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, `i` is greater than 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is equal to 2 and all other elements in `dp` are equal to 1. Otherwise, the state of `dp` remains unchanged with all elements equal to 1.***
