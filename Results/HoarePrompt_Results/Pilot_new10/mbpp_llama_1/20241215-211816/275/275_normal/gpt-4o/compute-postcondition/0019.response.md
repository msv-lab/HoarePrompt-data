Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and has at least one more element than the previous `nums`. The current value of `nums` has a length greater than the previous `nums`. `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`. `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`, `j` is 0. The current value of `nums` at index `i` is divisible by the current value of `nums` at index `j`, meaning `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`.**
