The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `dp[i]` initially equals 1 and all elements in `dp` are initially 1, and considering that `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`, the update to `dp[i]` will be `dp[j] + 1`, which is 2, because `dp[j]` is initially 1. This is under the assumption that `j` is the index of the divisor of `nums[i]` and `j < i` since `nums` is sorted in ascending order and `i > 0`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with `dp[i]` equal to 2 and all other elements equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0**
