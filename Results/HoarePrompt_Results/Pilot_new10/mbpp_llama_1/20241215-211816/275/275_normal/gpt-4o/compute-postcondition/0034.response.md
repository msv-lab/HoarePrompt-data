To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`. This indicates that the loop iterates over all indices from 0 up to but not including `i`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp` reflects the chains of divisors up to the current `i` with `dp[i]` being the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1 because the loop's range is defined by `i`. This change in `i` potentially allows `j` to take on a new value within the range of `i`. Since `j` is now in its next iteration, it starts from 0 again for the new `i`.

Given that `i` increases by 1:
- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.
- `i` is now greater than its previous value (so if it was greater than 0, it's now greater than 1).
- `j` resets to 0 for the next iteration of the outer loop (not the `for j in range(i):` loop itself, but considering the context that we're analyzing the state transition).
- The condition regarding `dp` and the divisibility of `nums[i]` by `nums[j]` still holds, but now it's considered for the new `i` and the range of possible `j` values up to the new `i`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp` reflects the chains of divisors up to the current `i` with `dp[i]` being the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
