To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state provides that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 6 elements, `i` is equal to the new length of `nums` and is greater than 1, and `dp` has a length equal to the new length of `nums`. The code snippet given is `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. 

However, the given code snippet seems incomplete as it doesn't specify the value or range of `j`. For the purpose of this analysis, we'll assume `j` is an index that has been defined and is within the valid range for `dp` and `nums`.

Given this, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This implies that the value of `dp[i]` could either remain the same (if `dp[i]` is already greater than or equal to `dp[j] + 1`) or increase by at least 1 (if `dp[j] + 1` is greater than the current `dp[i]`).

The states of `nums` and the fact that `i` equals the new length of `nums` and is greater than 1 are not affected by the code. The length and the sorted nature of `nums` remain unchanged, as does the value of `i`. The `dp` array's length also remains the same, but the value at index `i` may have changed.

Therefore, considering the assumption about `j` and the operation performed, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 6 elements, `i` is equal to the new length of `nums` and is greater than 1, `dp` has a length equal to the new length of `nums`, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 6 elements, `i` is equal to the new length of `nums` and is greater than 1, `dp` has a length equal to the new length of `nums`, and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
