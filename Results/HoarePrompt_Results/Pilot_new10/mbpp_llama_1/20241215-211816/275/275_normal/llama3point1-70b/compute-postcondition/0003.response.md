The code `nums.sort()` sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. The initial state is that `nums` is a list of integers and is not empty. 

After executing the code, the list `nums` will be sorted in ascending order. The fact that `nums` is a list of integers and is not empty remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty**
