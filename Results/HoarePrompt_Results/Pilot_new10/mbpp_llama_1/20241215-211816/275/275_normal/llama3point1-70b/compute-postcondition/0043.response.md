The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the function returns either 0 or the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in the list `nums`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return either 0 or the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in `nums`.
