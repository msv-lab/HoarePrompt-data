To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
```
State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements.
- `i` is equal to the original length of `nums` and is greater than 0.
- `dp` has a length equal to the length of `nums` where if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for any `j` ranging from `i-1` down to 0, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged.
- `j` has ranged from `i-1` down to 0.

To execute the loop one more time, the loop variable `j` should be able to take on a new value within the range defined by `range(i)`. However, since `j` has already ranged from `i-1` down to 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1, allowing `j` to take on a new value that was previously out of range.

Considering the relationship between `i` and the length of `nums`, if `i` increases by 1, the length of `nums` should also increase by 1 to maintain the condition that `i` is equal to the original length of `nums`. This implies that `nums` should have at least 5 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

The value of `dp` will also need to be updated to reflect the new length of `nums`. Specifically, `dp` should now have a length equal to the new length of `nums`, which is `i + 1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 5 elements, `i` is equal to the new length of `nums` and is greater than 0, `dp` has a length equal to the new length of `nums`, `j` will range from `i-1` down to 0**
