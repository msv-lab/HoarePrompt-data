According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute because the loop starts from index 1. Since `nums` is already stated to be not empty, we need to ensure it has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute. The state of `dp` is also given but it does not affect the loop's execution condition directly. Before the loop starts, `i` should be at the starting point of the loop, which is 1, considering the loop's range is from 1 to the length of `nums`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1, `i` is 1**
