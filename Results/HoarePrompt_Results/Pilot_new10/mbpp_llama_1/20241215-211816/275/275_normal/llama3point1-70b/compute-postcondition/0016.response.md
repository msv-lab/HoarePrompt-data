To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given loop code and the patterns observed from the output states after executing the loop a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```
From the output states provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
2. `i` increments by 1 after each iteration of the outer loop (not shown in the provided code snippet, but implied from the context of the problem).
3. `j` takes values from 0 to `i-1` in each iteration of the inner loop.
4. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude that:

* `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements (as given in the initial state).
* `i` will be equal to the length of `nums` minus 1 (since the loop iterates over the indices of `nums`).
* `dp` will contain the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for each element in `nums`. Specifically, `dp[i]` will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.**
