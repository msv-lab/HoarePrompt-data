To determine the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables and their initial states. 

- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.

The code snippet provided is `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. 

Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, this translates to `dp[2] = max(dp[2], dp[0] + 1)`. 

Without knowing the initial values of `dp[2]` and `dp[0]`, we cannot determine the exact value that `dp[2]` will be assigned after the execution. However, we can infer that `dp[2]` will be the maximum between its current value and `dp[0] + 1`. 

Since `nums` and the values of `i` and `j` do not directly influence the calculation of `dp[2]` in this specific line of code, and assuming `dp` is a list or array where `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` refer to elements at indices `i` and `j` respectively, the states of `nums`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, after executing the given code:

- `nums` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` remains 0.
- `dp[2]` is updated to be the maximum between its previous value and `dp[0] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `dp[2]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0] + 1`.**
