To determine the output state, we first examine the initial state and the given code. The initial state specifies that `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1. The code snippet is `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, we substitute these values into the code to understand its impact. This results in `dp[2] = max(dp[2], dp[1] + 1)`. 

The list `dp` is not directly described in the initial state, but based on the operation, it seems `dp` is a list or array where each index corresponds to some value derived from `nums`. The operation `dp[2] = max(dp[2], dp[1] + 1)` implies that `dp[2]` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[1]` plus one.

Since the specific values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot calculate an exact numerical value for `dp[2]` after the operation. However, we can say that `dp[2]` will be either its original value (if it was already greater than `dp[1] + 1`) or `dp[1] + 1` (if `dp[1] + 1` is greater than the original value of `dp[2]`).

The states of `nums`, `i`, and `j` are not altered by the given code snippet, as it only modifies the `dp` list. Therefore, `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` remains 2, and `j` remains 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp[2]` is the maximum of its original value and `dp[1] + 1`.**
