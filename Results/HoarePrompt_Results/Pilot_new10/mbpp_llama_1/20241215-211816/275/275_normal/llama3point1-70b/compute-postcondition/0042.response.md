To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

The initial state provides us with:
- `nums`: a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `dp`: a list of the same length as `nums`, where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`.

The code snippet is simply `return max(dp)`. This means the program will return the maximum value found in the `dp` list.

Given that `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, the maximum value in `dp` would be the longest length of such a subsequence found among all the numbers in `nums`.

Therefore, the program returns the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in the sorted list `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in the list `nums`.**
