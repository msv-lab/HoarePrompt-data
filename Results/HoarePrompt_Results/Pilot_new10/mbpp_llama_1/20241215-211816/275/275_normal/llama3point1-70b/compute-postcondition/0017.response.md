According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1 (since the loop range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including the length of `nums`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be equal to the length of `nums`, but since the loop only goes up to the length of `nums` minus 1, this condition cannot be met with the current length of `nums`. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `nums` must be increased by at least 1 so that the new `i` (which is the old length of `nums`) is less than the new length of `nums` minus 1. Therefore, `nums` must have at least one more element, making `i` less than the new length of `nums` minus 1, `dp` must also have one more element to match the length of `nums`, and since `i` is the index, it should be incremented to point to the next position. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1 (considering the original length of `nums`), `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and has at least one more element**
