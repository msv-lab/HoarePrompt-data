To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 0.
- The state of `dp` depends on whether `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, but since we're looking at the state adjustment for the next iteration of the loop, the current state of `dp` is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`. This means `j` will take values from 0 up to but not including `i`. Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `j` has already taken the value 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must increase so that `j` can take another value within the range defined by `i`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented because the loop condition depends on `j` ranging from 0 to `i-1`.
- Since `i` is incremented, `j` will start from 0 again in the next iteration of the outer loop (not shown), considering the incremented value of `i`.
- `nums` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to make sense in the context of incrementing `i` and having `j` range over values less than `i`.
- The state of `dp` will be updated based on the new values of `i` and `j` according to the logic inside the loop body, which is not provided. However, for the purpose of the loop condition, the focus is on `i` and the range it defines for `j`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
