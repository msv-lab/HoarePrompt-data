According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to the original length of `nums` minus 1, `dp[i]` is the maximum length of the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, and `j` is `i-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. However, since `i` is already at the last index of `nums`, the loop cannot execute again with the current `nums`. But if we consider the state for the loop to potentially execute again, `i` would be equal to the original length of `nums`, and since the loop starts from 1, `i` would need to be less than the length of `nums` for the loop to execute. This implies that `nums` would need to have at least one more element for `i` to be within the loop's range. Also, `j` would be equal to the new `i` minus 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is equal to the original length of `nums`, `dp` has a length equal to the length of `nums` with `dp[i-1]` being the maximum length of the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i-1]`, and `j` is `i-1`**
