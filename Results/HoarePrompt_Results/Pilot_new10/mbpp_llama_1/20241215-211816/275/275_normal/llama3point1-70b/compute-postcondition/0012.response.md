Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 0. If `nums[2]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, then `dp[2]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[0] + 1`. If `nums[2]` is not divisible by `nums[0]`, then the state remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code***
