To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the original program, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the program.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that adds a given tuple to a given list. The result should be a list that includes all elements from the original list followed by the elements of the tuple.

2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
   ```
   This function takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple into a list, and then concatenates this list with the original list using the `+` operator.

3. **Original Assessment**: There is no original assessment provided, so we proceed with the analysis based on the problem description and the code.

4. **Annotated Version**:
   The annotated version provides insight into the state of the program before the function call and after the function execution. It confirms that the function takes a list and a tuple, converts the tuple to a list, and then returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the tuple converted to a list.

Given this information, the program's behavior aligns with the problem description. It correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list. The function returns a new list without modifying the original list, which is a desirable behavior in many contexts for maintaining data integrity and predictability.

The original assessment was "None," implying there was no initial judgment on the program's correctness. Based on the analysis, the program is indeed correct according to the provided problem description and the annotations.

**Reason for the Final Assessment**:
- The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
- It handles the input types (list and tuple) as expected and converts the tuple to a list to facilitate concatenation.
- The annotated version confirms the expected behavior and state transitions within the program.

**Final: True**
