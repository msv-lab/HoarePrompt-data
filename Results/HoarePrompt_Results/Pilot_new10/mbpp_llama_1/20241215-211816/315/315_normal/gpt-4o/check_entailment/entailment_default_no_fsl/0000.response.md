Correctness: **True**

The code provided is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the tuple converted to a list.

Here's why the code works:

1. The function takes two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `tpl` (a tuple).
2. The expression `list(tpl)` converts the tuple `tpl` to a list.
3. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the input list `lst` and the converted list from `tpl`.
4. The resulting list is then returned by the function.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs. The output hints also confirm that the function's behavior matches its expected output.

There are no obvious edge cases that would cause the function to fail, such as handling empty lists or tuples, or lists/tuples containing different data types. The function's implementation is straightforward and robust, making it correct for all potential cases.
