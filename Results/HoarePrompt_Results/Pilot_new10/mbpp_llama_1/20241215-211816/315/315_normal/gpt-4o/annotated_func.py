#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns a list that is the concatenation of list 'lst' and tuple 'tpl' converted to a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list and a tuple, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the tuple converted to a list
