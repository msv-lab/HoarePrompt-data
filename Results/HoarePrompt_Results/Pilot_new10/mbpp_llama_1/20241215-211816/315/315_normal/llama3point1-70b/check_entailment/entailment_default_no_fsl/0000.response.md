Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description because it does not actually add the tuple to the list, but instead converts the tuple to a list and concatenates the two lists, returning a new list. This is not the same as adding the tuple to the list as a single element.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]` and the input tuple is `(4, 5)`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, whereas the correct output should be `[1, 2, 3, (4, 5)]`. The correct implementation should use the `append` method to add the tuple to the list as a single element, like this: `input_list.append(input_tuple)` and then return the modified list. However, since the function is supposed to return a new list and not modify the original list, the correct implementation should create a copy of the original list and then append the tuple to the copy, like this: `new_list = input_list.copy()` and then `new_list.append(input_tuple)` and finally `return new_list`. 

Here's how the correct function should look like:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    new_list = input_list.copy()
    new_list.append(input_tuple)
    return new_list
```

This function will return a new list where the input tuple is added as a single element, as required by the problem description.
