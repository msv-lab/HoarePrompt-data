The problem description asks to write a function to add the given tuple to the given list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an `input_list` and an `input_tuple` as parameters and returns a new list that is the combination of the elements in the `input_list` and the `input_tuple`. 

The original assessment is `None`, indicating that no initial assessment of the program's correctness was provided.

The output hints suggest that the function should accept a list and a tuple as parameters and return a new list that combines the elements of the input list and the input tuple.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the function `func_1` is correctly implemented. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `input_list` and the `list(input_tuple)`, which effectively adds the elements of the tuple to the list.

The reason why I believe the original assessment is not accurate is that it was `None`, indicating a lack of assessment. However, based on the code and the output hints, I can make a determination about the correctness of the program.

The provided code correctly implements the required functionality, and the output hints suggest that the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
