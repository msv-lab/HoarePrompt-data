Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it returns a new list that combines the original list and the tuple, rather than adding the tuple to the original list. 

The problem description asks to "add the given tuple to the given list", which implies that the original list should be modified to include the tuple. However, the program returns a new list without modifying the original list.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not follow the problem description:

```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
input_tuple = (4, 5, 6)

result = func_1(input_list, input_tuple)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(input_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3] (the original list is not modified)
```

To meet the problem description, the program should modify the original list by appending the tuple to it, like this:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

Or, if the intention is to flatten the tuple into the list, the program should extend the original list with the tuple elements, like this:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.extend(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
