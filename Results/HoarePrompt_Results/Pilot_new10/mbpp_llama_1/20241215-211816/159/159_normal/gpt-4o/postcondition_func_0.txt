The function calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height, returning the result of the formula `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`, without validating that the inputs are non-negative real numbers, thus potentially returning incorrect volumes for negative inputs or throwing errors for non-numeric inputs.
