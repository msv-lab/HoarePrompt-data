Correctness: **False**

The code provided calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height, using the formula `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`. However, the function does not validate that the inputs are non-negative real numbers. If a negative number is passed as the radius or height, the function will return an incorrect volume, as the volume of a cone cannot be negative. For instance, if the function is called with `func_1(-5, 12)`, it will return a negative value, which is invalid. Additionally, if a non-numeric input is passed, the function will throw an error. The function should include input validation to ensure that the inputs are valid and handle cases where the inputs are not valid.
