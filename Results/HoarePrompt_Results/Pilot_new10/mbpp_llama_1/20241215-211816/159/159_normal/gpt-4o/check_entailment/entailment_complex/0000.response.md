Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height using the formula `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`. This formula is consistent with the mathematical definition of the volume of a cone. 

The function does not include any input validation to ensure that the radius and height are non-negative real numbers. However, the problem description does not explicitly require input validation. It only states that the function should calculate the volume of a cone, which the function does correctly.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function returns the correct results for different inputs, which further supports the conclusion that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

It's worth noting that the program could be improved by adding input validation to handle cases where the radius or height is negative or not a real number. However, based on the provided problem description, the program is considered correct.
