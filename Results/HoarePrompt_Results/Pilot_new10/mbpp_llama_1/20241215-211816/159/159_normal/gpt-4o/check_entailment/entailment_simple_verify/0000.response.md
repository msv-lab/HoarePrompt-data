The problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a cone. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone using the formula `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`. The annotated version of the code states that the program returns the volume of a cone, which is a non-negative real number calculated as `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`, where `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment of "None" implies that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. However, upon reviewing the code and the annotations, it appears that the program is indeed correct.

The formula used in the `func_1` function is the correct formula for the volume of a cone. The annotations also confirm that the program returns a non-negative real number, which is consistent with the expected output.

The assertions at the beginning of the code provide test cases for the `func_1` function, and the use of `math.isclose` suggests that the author is aware of the potential for floating-point precision errors.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
