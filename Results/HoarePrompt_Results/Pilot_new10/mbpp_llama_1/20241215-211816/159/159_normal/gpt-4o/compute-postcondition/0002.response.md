To determine the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze the provided annotated code and return postconditions.

1. **Parameters and Return Value**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are described as non-negative real numbers. It returns a single value, which is the calculated volume of a cone.

2. **Calculation**: The volume of the cone is calculated using the formula `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`. This is a direct implementation of the formula for the volume of a cone, where `pi` is a mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, `radius` is the radius of the cone's base, and `height` is the height of the cone.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
    - **Negative Input**: The annotations specify that `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. However, the code does not explicitly check for negative inputs. If negative values are passed to the function, it will still perform the calculation, potentially leading to an incorrect result in the context of geometric volumes (since negative dimensions do not make sense for physical objects like cones). The function will return a negative volume if either the radius or height is negative, which could be considered an error in the context of calculating volumes of physical objects.
    - **Zero Input**: If either `radius` or `height` is zero, the function will return a volume of zero, which is mathematically correct since a cone with zero radius or zero height has no volume.
    - **Non-numeric Input**: The code does not check if the inputs are numeric. If non-numeric inputs are provided, the function will throw an error when attempting to perform mathematical operations on them.

4. **Functionality Summary**: The function calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height using the formula `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`. It does not validate the inputs to ensure they are non-negative or numeric, which could lead to incorrect results or errors for certain inputs.

Functionality: ** The function calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height, returning the result of the formula `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`, without validating that the inputs are non-negative real numbers, thus potentially returning incorrect volumes for negative inputs or throwing errors for non-numeric inputs. **
