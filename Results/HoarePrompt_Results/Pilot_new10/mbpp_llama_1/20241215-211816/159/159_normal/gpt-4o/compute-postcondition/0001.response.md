The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the volume of a cone, calculated as 1/3 * pi * `radius`^2 * `height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of a cone based on these input values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, which are non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume of a cone calculated as 1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height.**
