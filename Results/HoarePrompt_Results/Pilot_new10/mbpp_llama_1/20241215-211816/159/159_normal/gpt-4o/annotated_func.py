#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cone, which is a non-negative real number calculated as 1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height, returning the result of the formula `1/3 * pi * radius^2 * height`, without validating that the inputs are non-negative real numbers, thus potentially returning incorrect volumes for negative inputs or throwing errors for non-numeric inputs.
