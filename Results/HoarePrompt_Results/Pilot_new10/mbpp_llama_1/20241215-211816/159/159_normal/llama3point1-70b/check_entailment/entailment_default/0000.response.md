Correctness: **False**

The code does not validate if the inputs are non-negative real numbers, which can lead to incorrect results or errors for invalid inputs. For example, if the input radius or height is a negative number, the function will still return a result, which is not a valid volume for a cone. Additionally, if the input radius or height is not a number (e.g., a string or a list), the function will throw an error. 

The formula used in the function `1/3 * π * radius² * height` is correct for calculating the volume of a cone, but the lack of input validation makes the function incorrect for every potential case. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

To fix this issue, the function should include input validation to ensure that the inputs are non-negative real numbers before calculating the volume.
