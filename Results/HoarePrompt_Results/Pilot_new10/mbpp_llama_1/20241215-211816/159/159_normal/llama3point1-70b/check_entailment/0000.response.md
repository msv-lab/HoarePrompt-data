Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cone is \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The program correctly implements this formula using the `math.pi` constant for pi and the given input parameters `radius` and `height`.

The code does not handle potential edge cases where the inputs might be invalid (e.g., negative values for radius or height, or non-numeric inputs), but based on the strict interpretation of the problem description provided, which asks to verify if the program calculates the volume of a cone correctly without specifying any constraints on the inputs, the program is correct for all positive numeric inputs of radius and height.

In a real-world application, it would be beneficial to add error checking to handle such edge cases, ensuring the function behaves as expected for a broader range of inputs. However, given the problem description and focusing solely on the mathematical correctness of calculating the volume of a cone with provided valid inputs, the program functions correctly.
