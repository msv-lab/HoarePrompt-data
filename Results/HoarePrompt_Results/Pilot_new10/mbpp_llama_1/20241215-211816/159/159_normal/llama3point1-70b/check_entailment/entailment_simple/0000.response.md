To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to check if it accurately calculates the volume of a cone as per the provided problem description.

The problem description asks for a function to find the volume of a cone, which is a non-negative real number calculated as 1/3 * π * radius² * height, where radius and height are non-negative real numbers.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes `radius` and `height` as input and returns the calculated volume using the formula `1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height`. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The formula used in the program matches the one specified in the problem description: 1/3 * π * radius² * height.
2. The program uses the `math.pi` constant for π, ensuring a precise value.
3. The function multiplies `radius` by itself to calculate radius², aligning with the formula.
4. The function correctly multiplies the result by `height` and the fraction 1/3 (represented as 1.0 / 3 to ensure floating-point division).
5. The function returns the calculated volume, which will be a non-negative real number given that radius and height are non-negative real numbers.

Given these points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, it correctly calculates the volume of a cone for any non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height`.

Correctness: **True**
