Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not handle non-integer values in the list correctly, as hinted in the output hints. For example, if the input list contains a string or a float, the modulus operator (`%`) will either throw a `TypeError` or return an incorrect result, respectively. 

Consider the following example: 
```python
numbers = [1, 2, '3', 4.5, 6]
```
In this case, the function will throw a `TypeError` when it tries to calculate `'3' % 2` or `4.5 % 2`.

Another issue is that the function does not check if the input is a list. If the input is not a list, the function will throw a `TypeError`. For example:
```python
numbers = '123'
```
In this case, the function will throw a `TypeError` when it tries to iterate over the string as if it were a list.

To fix these issues, the function should include error checking to ensure that the input is a list of integers. Here is a possible corrected version:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not isinstance(numbers, list):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a list")
    return [num for num in numbers if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2 == 0]
```
This version of the function checks if the input is a list and raises a `ValueError` if it is not. It also checks if each element of the list is an integer before trying to calculate its remainder modulo 2.
