Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(numbers)` uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from the input list `numbers`. It correctly checks if a number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`), which returns `True` if the number is even and `False` otherwise.

The function handles various potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty list: If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list, which is the expected output.
* List with only even numbers: If the input list contains only even numbers, the function returns the entire list.
* List with only odd numbers: If the input list contains only odd numbers, the function returns an empty list.
* List with both even and odd numbers: If the input list contains a mix of even and odd numbers, the function returns a list of only the even numbers.

The function also handles non-integer inputs correctly, as it will raise a `TypeError` if the input list contains non-integer values.

Since I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the given problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
