Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Although the code correctly identifies and returns even numbers from a list of integers, it does not handle cases where the input is not a list or where the list contains non-integer values. 

For instance, if the input is not a list (e.g., a string, integer, or float), the function will throw an error because it expects an iterable. Similarly, if the list contains non-integer values (e.g., strings, floats), the function may either throw an error when trying to perform the modulo operation (`num % 2`) or behave unexpectedly if the non-integer value can be coerced into an integer but doesn't make sense in the context of the problem (e.g., trying to determine if a string is even).

Here is an example where the function does not work as expected:
- Input: `func_1("123")` - This will throw an error because the input is a string, not a list.
- Input: `func_1([1, "two", 3])` - This will throw an error when trying to apply `num % 2` to the string "two".

To make the code correct for every potential case, it should include input validation to ensure that the input is a list and that all elements in the list are integers.
