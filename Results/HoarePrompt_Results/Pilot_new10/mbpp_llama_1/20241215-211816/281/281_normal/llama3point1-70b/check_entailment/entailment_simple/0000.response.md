Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`.
2. For each number, it checks the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which is the standard way to determine if a number is even (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0).
3. If the condition is true, the number is included in the output list; otherwise, it is skipped.
4. The resulting list of even numbers is then returned by the function.

This implementation correctly meets the problem description for every potential case:

* It correctly identifies and returns even numbers from the input list.
* It handles both positive and negative even numbers, as well as zero.
* It works for lists of any size, including empty lists.
* It does not modify the original input list, but instead returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

Overall, the program is correct and fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description.
