The original assessment is None, which means there is no existing evaluation of the program's correctness. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from the input list, which aligns with the problem description.

The output hints provide additional information about the function's behavior, including its assumption that the input list only contains integers and does not handle non-integer values or null inputs explicitly. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the output hints do not reveal any inaccuracies in the original assessment.

The code provides unit tests that demonstrate its correctness for various input scenarios. The function correctly identifies even numbers in the input list and returns them in a new list.

Final: **True**
