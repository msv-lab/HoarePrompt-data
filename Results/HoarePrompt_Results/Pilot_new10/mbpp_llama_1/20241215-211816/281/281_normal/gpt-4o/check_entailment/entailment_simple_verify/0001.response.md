To assess the correctness of the provided Python function, let's break down the information given:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
2. **Original Assessment**: There is no original assessment provided, so we start with a blank slate.
3. **Provided Code**:
   ```
   def func_1(numbers):
       return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
   ```
   This code uses list comprehension to generate a list of numbers from the input list `numbers` where each number is even (i.e., the remainder of the division by 2 is 0).

4. **Annotated Code**:
   The annotated version of the code includes comments that describe the state of the program:
   - Before the function call, `numbers` is a list of integers.
   - The function returns a list of even integers from the `numbers` list.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the code appears to accurately implement a function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The use of `num % 2 == 0` as the condition for including a number in the output list is correct for identifying even numbers.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment by clarifying the expected input (a list of integers) and the output (a list of even integers from the input list).

**Reasoning**:
- The code correctly filters the input list to include only even numbers.
- The annotated code provides a clear description of the expected input and output, which matches the problem description.
- The absence of an original assessment means we have no prior evaluation to contradict or support, leaving us to judge the code based solely on its implementation and the annotations provided.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function correctly identifies and returns even numbers from a given list of numbers. 

Final: **True**
