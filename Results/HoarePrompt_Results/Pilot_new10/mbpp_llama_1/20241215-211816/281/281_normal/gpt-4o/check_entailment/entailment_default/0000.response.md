Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses list comprehension to filter out the even numbers by checking if each number `num` in the input list `numbers` satisfies the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This condition is true for even numbers because the remainder of an even number divided by 2 is 0.

The function correctly handles various cases as demonstrated by the provided assertions:

- It filters out even numbers from a mixed list of integers.
- It handles lists with multiple even numbers, including zero.
- It correctly identifies even numbers in a list that contains both even and odd integers.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, stating that it returns a new list containing the even integers from the input list. If the input list is empty or contains no even integers, the function correctly returns an empty list, as demonstrated by the fact that it does not explicitly handle these cases but its logic naturally leads to the correct outcome.

Although the function does not explicitly handle non-integer values or null inputs, and the output hints mention this as a potential source of errors, the problem description and the assertions provided focus on the functionality with lists of integers. For the specified problem description, the code works correctly for every potential case involving lists of integers.
