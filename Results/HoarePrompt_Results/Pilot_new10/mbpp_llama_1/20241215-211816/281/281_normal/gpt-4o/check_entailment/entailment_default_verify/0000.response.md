The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial assessment was made. Based on the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the code is correct. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a new list containing the even integers from the input list, and returns an empty list if the input list is empty or contains no even integers.

The code uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers, which is a concise and efficient way to achieve this task. The condition `num % 2 == 0` correctly identifies even numbers, and the list comprehension returns a new list containing only the numbers that satisfy this condition.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
