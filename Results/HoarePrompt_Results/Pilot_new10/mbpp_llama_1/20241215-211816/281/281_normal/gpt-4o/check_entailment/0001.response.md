Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). If this condition is true, the number is included in the output list.

The code correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `[2, 4]`.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it correctly returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it correctly returns `[8, 12]`.

Upon analyzing the code, there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail for any potential input. It correctly identifies even numbers based on the modulo operation, which is a standard and reliable method for determining evenness in mathematics and programming.

Therefore, the function appears to be correct and will work as expected for any list of numbers.
