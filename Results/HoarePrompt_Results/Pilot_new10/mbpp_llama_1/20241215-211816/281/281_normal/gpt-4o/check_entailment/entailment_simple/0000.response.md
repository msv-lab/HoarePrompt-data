Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the function described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of even numbers from the input list.

Here's why it works:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`.
2. For each number, it checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If the remainder of the division of `num` by 2 is 0, then the number is even.
3. If a number is even, it is included in the output list.
4. The function returns the list of even numbers.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input scenarios. The function correctly identifies even numbers in the input lists and returns them in a new list.

There are no apparent cases where the program would not follow the problem description. The function handles both positive and negative even numbers (not shown in the unit tests), as well as zero, which is an even number. The modulo operator works correctly for all integer inputs, ensuring that the function accurately identifies even numbers in the input list.

In summary, the program correctly implements the function described in the problem description, and the provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
