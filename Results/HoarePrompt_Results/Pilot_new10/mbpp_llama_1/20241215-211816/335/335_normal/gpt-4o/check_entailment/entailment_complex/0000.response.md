Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It finds the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and returns None if there is no match.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, which are the strings to search in and the substring to search for, respectively.
2. It uses the `find` method to find the starting position of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, `find` returns -1, and the function returns None.
3. If `sub_string` is found, the function calculates the ending position by adding the length of `sub_string` to the starting position.
4. The function returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position.
5. The unit tests provided ensure that the function behaves correctly in different scenarios, such as when the substring is found at the beginning, middle, or end of the string, and when it is not found at all.

The program always does what the problem description says because it:

* Correctly handles the case where the substring is not found by returning None.
* Correctly finds the starting position of the substring using the `find` method.
* Correctly calculates the ending position of the substring by adding its length to the starting position.
* Correctly returns the substring, its starting position, and its ending position as a tuple.

Overall, the program is well-structured, easy to understand, and correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description.
