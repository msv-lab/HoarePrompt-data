Based on the problem description, the original assessment of "None" seems to indicate that the original assessors did not provide any feedback on the program's correctness. 

Upon reviewing the provided code and the annotated version, it appears that the function is designed to find the first occurrence of a substring within a string and return the substring, its starting index, and the index of its last character.

The annotated code suggests that the function behaves as intended, returning `None` when the substring is not found and providing the correct indices when it is found.

However, the problem description asks for the "occurrence and position of the substrings within a string," which could be interpreted as asking for all occurrences of the substring, not just the first one. The provided code only finds the first occurrence.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate in the sense that it does not provide any feedback, and the code does not fully meet the problem description if we interpret it as requiring all occurrences of the substring.

The final assessment is that the program does not fully meet the problem description, assuming the description implies finding all occurrences of the substring.

Final: **False**
