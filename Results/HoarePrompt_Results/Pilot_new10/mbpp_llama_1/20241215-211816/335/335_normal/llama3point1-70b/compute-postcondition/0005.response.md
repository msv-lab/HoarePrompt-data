To find the output state, let's consider the information given and the return statement.

- `string` is a string.
- `substring` is a string found within `string`.
- `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.
- `end` is `start + len(substring)`, which means it's the index right after the last character of the `substring` in `string`.
- The return statement is `return substring, start, end - 1`.

Given this, the program returns:
- `substring`: This is the string that was found within `string`.
- `start`: This is the starting index of `substring` in `string`.
- `end - 1`: Since `end` is the index right after the last character of `substring`, `end - 1` would be the index of the last character of `substring` in `string`.

Therefore, considering the provided information:
Output State: **The program returns the substring found in the string, the starting index of this substring, and the index of the last character of the substring.**
