Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` effectively finds the occurrence and position of the first substring within the given string. It uses the built-in `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring. If the substring is not found, `find` returns -1, and the function returns `None`. 

When the substring is found, it calculates the end index by adding the length of the substring to the start index and then subtracts 1 because the end index in Python is typically exclusive.

The function appears to handle all potential cases correctly:

1. It returns `None` if the substring is not found in the string.
2. It correctly identifies the start and end indices of the substring when it is found.
3. The end index calculation correctly accounts for the length of the substring, ensuring it points to the last character of the matched substring, not beyond it.

For example, if you call `func_1("Hello, World!", "World")`, it will return `('World', 7, 11)`, which correctly indicates the substring "World" and its start and end indices within the string.

Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement for all potential cases, its correctness is confirmed.
