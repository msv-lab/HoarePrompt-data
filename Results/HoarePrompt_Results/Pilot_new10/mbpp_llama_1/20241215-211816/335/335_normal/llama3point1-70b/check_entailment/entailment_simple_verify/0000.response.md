The original assessment is "None", which implies a lack of judgment on the program's correctness. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a string and a substring as input, finds the first occurrence of the substring in the string, and returns a tuple containing the found substring, its starting index, and its ending index.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program works as expected. It correctly handles the case when the substring is not found in the string (returning `None`) and provides the correct information when the substring is found.

However, it's worth noting that the function only finds the first occurrence of the substring. If there are multiple occurrences, the function will only return the first one. The problem description does not specify whether the function should find all occurrences or only the first one, but based on the provided code, it seems that the intention is to find only the first occurrence.

Therefore, assuming that the intention is to find only the first occurrence, the original assessment can be updated to reflect that the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
