The original assessment is None, which implies a lack of evaluation or conclusion about the program's correctness. 

Upon reviewing the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the program is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns `None` if the `substring` is not found in the `string`. If the `substring` is found, it returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its starting index in the `string`, and the index of its last character in the `string`.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior, including its handling of edge cases such as empty strings. According to the annotations, the function returns `None` for an empty `substring` in a non-empty `string` and a tuple with an empty string, start index 0, and end index -1 if both inputs are empty strings.

Based on the problem description and the annotated code, it seems that the program behaves as expected. The function correctly identifies the occurrence and position of the substring within the string and handles edge cases appropriately.

The original assessment of None does not provide any information about the program's correctness. However, after reviewing the code and annotations, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
