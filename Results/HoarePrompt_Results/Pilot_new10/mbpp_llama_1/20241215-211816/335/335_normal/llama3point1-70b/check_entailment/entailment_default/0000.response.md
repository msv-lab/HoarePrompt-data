Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. It finds the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string and returns None if there is no match. The function uses the `find()` method to get the starting index of the substring, and then calculates the ending index by adding the length of the substring to the starting index. 

The output hints agree with the code, mentioning that it returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting index, and the index of its last character if the substring is found. It also mentions that the function returns None if the substring is not found, handles empty strings, and assumes inputs are strings without performing input validation.

One potential issue is the lack of input validation, as the output hints mention. However, this does not necessarily mean the code does not work correctly for the cases described in the problem description. The problem description does not explicitly mention handling non-string inputs, so the code's behavior in these cases is not specified.

The code handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the substring is not found (returns None), and when the substring is empty (returns None for a non-empty string, and a tuple with an empty string, start index 0, and end index -1 for an empty string).

Overall, the code seems to work correctly for all the cases described in the problem description, and there are no apparent examples where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
