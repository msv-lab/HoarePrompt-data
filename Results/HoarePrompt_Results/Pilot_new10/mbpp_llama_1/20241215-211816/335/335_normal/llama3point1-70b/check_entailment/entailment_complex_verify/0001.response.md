The original assessment is "None", which implies that it is incomplete or missing. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the annotated version of the code suggests that the function is implemented correctly. It returns the occurrence and position of the substring within the string, and returns None if there is no match.

The annotated version provides a clear understanding of the function's behavior, including its handling of empty strings and its assumption that inputs are strings. The function's implementation aligns with the problem description, and there are no obvious errors or omissions.

The reason the original assessment is not accurate is that it does not provide any evaluation of the program's correctness. The annotated version, on the other hand, provides a detailed explanation of the function's behavior and suggests that it is implemented correctly.

Based on the information available, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
