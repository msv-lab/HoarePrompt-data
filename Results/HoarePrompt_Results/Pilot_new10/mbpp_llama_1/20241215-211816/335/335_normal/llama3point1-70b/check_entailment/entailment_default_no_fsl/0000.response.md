Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description's requirements. It takes two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`. If `substring` is found, it returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its starting index in `string`, and the index of its last character in `string`.

The function uses the built-in `find` method of Python strings, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value. If the specified value is not found, it returns -1. This aligns perfectly with the problem description's requirements.

The function handles edge cases as expected. For example, if both `string` and `substring` are empty strings, it returns a tuple with an empty string, start index 0, and end index -1, which is consistent with the output hints.

Additionally, the function returns `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`, which meets the problem description's requirements. It also correctly handles cases where `substring` is found at the beginning or end of `string`, as well as cases where `substring` appears multiple times in `string` (although it only returns the first occurrence).

The output hints suggest that the function may exhibit unexpected behavior with non-string inputs, but this is not a requirement specified in the problem description. The problem description assumes that the inputs are strings, and the function is designed accordingly.

In conclusion, based on the provided code and output hints, the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description's requirements for every potential case.
