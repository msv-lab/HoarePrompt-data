To determine the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`, both of which are expected to be strings.

2. **Return Values**: 
   - If the `substring` is not found in the `string`, the function returns `None`.
   - If the `substring` is found in the `string`, the function returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its starting index in the `string`, and the index of the last character of the `substring`.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - The annotations and return postconditions cover the basic functionality but do not explicitly mention what happens if the input parameters are not strings. However, based on the code, it's clear that the function will still attempt to execute, potentially leading to errors if the inputs are not strings.
   - There's no mention of handling cases where the input `string` or `substring` is empty. The code will handle these cases: an empty `substring` will always be "found" at index 0, and an empty `string` will result in `None` being returned if the `substring` is not empty, or a tuple with an empty string, start index 0, and end index -1 if the `substring` is also empty.
   - The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs to ensure they are indeed strings. It assumes the inputs will always be strings, which could lead to unexpected behavior if they are not.

4. **Actual Functionality Based on the Code**:
   - The function searches for the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.
   - If `substring` is found, it returns the `substring`, its start index, and the index of its last character in `string`.
   - If `substring` is not found, it returns `None`.
   - The function does not validate the type of its inputs, so it may behave unexpectedly with non-string inputs.

Considering all potential cases and the actual code functionality, the summary should reflect what the code does, including any edge cases or missing logic not explicitly covered by the annotations or return postconditions.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and returns `None` if `substring` is not found in `string`. If `substring` is found, it returns a tuple containing the `substring`, its starting index in `string`, and the index of its last character in `string`. The function assumes inputs are strings and does not perform input validation, which may lead to unexpected behavior with non-string inputs. It handles empty strings by returning `None` for an empty `substring` in a non-empty `string`, and a tuple with an empty string, start index 0, and end index -1 if both inputs are empty strings. **
