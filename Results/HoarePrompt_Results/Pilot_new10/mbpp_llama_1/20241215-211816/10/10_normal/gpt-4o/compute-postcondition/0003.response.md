The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. All three parameters are positive numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the volume, which is calculated as 0.5 times the product of `base`, `height`, and `length`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive numbers `base`, `height`, and `length`, and return their volume, calculated as 0.5 times the product of these three values.
Functionality: **The function accepts three positive parameters base, height, and length, and returns their volume, calculated as 0.5 times the product of these three values.**
