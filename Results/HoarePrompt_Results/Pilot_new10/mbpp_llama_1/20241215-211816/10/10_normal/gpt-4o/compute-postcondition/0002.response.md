The `volume` variable is calculated as 0.5 * `base` * `height` * `length`. We have the following information about these variables: `base` is a positive number, `height` is a positive number, and `length` is a positive number.

Output State: **The program returns the volume which is 0.5 times the product of a positive base, a positive height, and a positive length**
