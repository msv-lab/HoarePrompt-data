Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is 0.5 times the base times the height times the length, which is exactly what the function `func_1` implements. 

The function takes three parameters, `base`, `height`, and `length`, and returns their volume. The calculation is performed in two steps: first, the area of the base is calculated as 0.5 times the base times the height, and then the volume is calculated as the base area times the length.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for various input values. 

The program assumes that the input values for `base`, `height`, and `length` are positive numbers, which is a valid assumption given the context of the problem. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is only applicable when all three dimensions are positive. 

In conclusion, the program correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
