Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is 0.5 times the base times the height times the length, which is implemented in the function as `base_area = 0.5 * base * height` and then `volume = base_area * length`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) cover different input cases and verify that the function returns the expected results. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the function would produce incorrect results. 

The output hints suggest that the function does not perform validation or error handling for non-positive input values, but this does not necessarily make the function incorrect. It simply means that the function assumes that the inputs will always be valid (positive numbers). 

Since the function correctly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism and passes the provided unit tests, it can be concluded that the function is correct for all potential cases where the inputs are positive numbers.
