The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. According to the annotations, these parameters are positive numbers. The function calculates the `base_area` as 0.5 times the product of `base` and `height`, and then calculates the `volume` as the product of `base_area` and `length`. The function returns the calculated `volume`.

However, upon examining the code, it appears that the function does not include any error checking or handling for potential edge cases, such as negative or zero values for `base`, `height`, or `length`. The code simply calculates and returns the `volume` based on the provided formula, regardless of the input values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters `base`, `height`, and `length`, and returns their volume, calculated as 0.5 times the product of these three values, without any validation or error handling for non-positive input values. **
