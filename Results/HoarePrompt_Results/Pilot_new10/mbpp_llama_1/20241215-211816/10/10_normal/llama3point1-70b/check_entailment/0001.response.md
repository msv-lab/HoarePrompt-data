Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is (base area) * (length), and the base area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2. 

Given this, the function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly implements this formula as `b * h / 2 * l`, where `b` is the base length of the triangular face, `h` is the height of the triangular face, and `l` is the length of the prism.

This function should work correctly for all valid inputs (i.e., positive numbers for `b`, `h`, and `l`), and it correctly handles the mathematical formula for the volume of a triangular prism. 

For example, if you call `func_1(2, 3, 4)`, it will return `12.0`, which is the correct volume of a triangular prism with a base length of 2, a height of 3, and a length of 4. 

Without any further information or potential edge cases that the function does not handle, such as negative numbers or non-numeric inputs, the function appears to be correct based on the provided problem description.
