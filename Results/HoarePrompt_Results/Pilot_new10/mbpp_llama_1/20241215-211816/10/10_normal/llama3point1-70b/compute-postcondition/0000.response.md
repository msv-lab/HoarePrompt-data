To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given formula: `return b * h / 2 * l`. 

Here, `b` represents the base length of the triangular prism, `h` is the height of the triangular base, and `l` is the length of the prism. All these values are non-negative numbers.

The formula `b * h / 2` calculates the area of the triangular base, since the area of a triangle is given by `(base * height) / 2`. Then, this area is multiplied by `l`, the length of the prism, to calculate the volume of the triangular prism.

Given that `b`, `h`, and `l` are non-negative numbers, the result of `b * h / 2 * l` will be the volume of the triangular prism, which is also a non-negative number.

Output State: **The program returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is the product of the area of the triangular base and the length of the prism, where the area of the base is calculated as (base length * height) / 2 and base length, height, and length are non-negative numbers.**
