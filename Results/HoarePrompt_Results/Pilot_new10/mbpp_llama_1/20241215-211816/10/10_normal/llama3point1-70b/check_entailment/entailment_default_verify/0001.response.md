Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I can assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the volume of a triangular prism. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula `b * h / 2 * l`, where `b` is the base length, `h` is the height, and `l` is the length.

The output hints state that the function accepts three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l` and returns their product divided by 2, which corresponds to the volume of a triangular prism if `b`, `h`, and `l` represent non-negative base length, height, and length respectively. However, it does not validate the non-negativity of the inputs and will return a value for any real numbers `b`, `h`, and `l`, including negative numbers and zero.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the program is correct in terms of calculating the volume of a triangular prism for valid inputs. The formula used is correct, and the function returns the expected result.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment of "None" is not applicable, as we have enough information to assess the correctness of the program. The output hints provide additional information that helps us understand the functionality of the program, and based on this information, I conclude that the program is correct for valid inputs.

Final: **True**
