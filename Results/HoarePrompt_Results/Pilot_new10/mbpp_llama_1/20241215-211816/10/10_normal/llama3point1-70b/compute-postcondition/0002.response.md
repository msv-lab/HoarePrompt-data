The function func_1 accepts three parameters: b (base length of the triangular prism), h (height of the triangular base), and l (length of the prism). According to the annotated code and return postconditions, the function calculates the volume of the triangular prism as 0.5 * b * h * l. 

Looking at the code, it directly returns the product of b, h, and l divided by 2, which matches the formula for the volume of a triangular prism. However, the code does not explicitly check if the inputs b, h, and l are non-negative as stated in the annotations. 

In case any of b, h, or l are negative, the function will still return a value, which might not be a valid volume in the context of the problem. Also, if any of b, h, or l are zero, the function will return zero, which corresponds to a degenerate case where the volume of the prism is zero.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters b, h, and l, and returns their product divided by 2, which corresponds to the volume of a triangular prism if b, h, and l represent non-negative base length, height, and length respectively; however, it does not validate the non-negativity of the inputs and will return a value for any real numbers b, h, and l, including negative numbers and zero. **
