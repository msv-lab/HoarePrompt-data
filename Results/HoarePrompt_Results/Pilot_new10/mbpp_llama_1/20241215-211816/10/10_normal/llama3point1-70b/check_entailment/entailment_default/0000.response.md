Correctness: **False**

The code provided calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula `b * h / 2 * l`, where `b` is the base length, `h` is the height, and `l` is the length. However, it does not validate the inputs, which means it will return a value for any real numbers `b`, `h`, and `l`, including negative numbers and zero. 

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input values are negative, for example, `func_1(-2, 3, 4)`. The function will return a value, but a triangular prism with a negative base length is not a valid geometric shape. Similarly, if the inputs are zero, the function will return zero, but a triangular prism with a zero base length, height, or length is also not a valid geometric shape.

The output hints agree with the code and they help prove that the code is incorrect. They state that the function will return a value for any real numbers `b`, `h`, and `l`, without any validation, which is a clear indication of the code's incorrectness. 

To fix the code, input validation should be added to ensure that `b`, `h`, and `l` are non-negative numbers. Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    if b < 0 or h < 0 or l < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input values must be non-negative")
    return b * h / 2 * l
```
