Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly based on its formula, which is `(base * height) / 2 * length`. However, the function lacks input validation, which means it does not check if the provided parameters `b`, `h`, and `l` are non-negative. 

For instance, if you pass in negative values for any of these parameters, the function will still return a result, which may not be meaningful in the context of calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The volume of a triangular prism cannot be negative, and having a base, height, or length of zero also does not make sense in this context, as it would not define a prism (it would either have no area or no length, thus no volume).

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case, as it does not handle invalid inputs (like negative numbers or zero for `b`, `h`, or `l`) and does not check if the inputs are non-negative numbers, which is a crucial condition for calculating the volume of a triangular prism.
