Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is None, which means we don't have any prior judgment about the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insights into the program's behavior and its expected outcomes. It explains that the function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` for which the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number has a length of `n`. This description matches the problem description.

Upon analyzing the annotated code, we can see that it correctly implements the required functionality. The function uses a while loop to generate triangular numbers and checks if the string representation of the current triangular number has a length of `n`. If it does, the function returns the current value of `k`. The loop will continue indefinitely until it finds a match, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, and `assert func_1(4) == 45`, also support the correctness of the program. These tests verify that the function returns the expected values for different inputs, which aligns with the problem description and the annotated code.

The only potential issue is that the function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs explicitly. However, as mentioned in the problem description and the annotated code, it is assumed that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this does not affect the correctness of the program within the specified constraints.

In conclusion, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the original assessment (None) implies that we did not have prior knowledge about the program's correctness. However, after analyzing the code and its annotations, we can determine that the program is correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
