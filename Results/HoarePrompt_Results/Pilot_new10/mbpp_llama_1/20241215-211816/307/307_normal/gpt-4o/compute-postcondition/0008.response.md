To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.

The given code is: `triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2`

Now, let's calculate the new value of `triangular_number`:
`triangular_number = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2`
`triangular_number = 2 * 3 // 2`
`triangular_number = 6 // 2`
`triangular_number = 3`

The value of `triangular_number` is updated to 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n` because the length of the string representation of 3 is 1 which may or may not be equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3**
