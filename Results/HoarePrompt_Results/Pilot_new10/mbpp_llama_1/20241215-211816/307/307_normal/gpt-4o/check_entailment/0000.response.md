Correctness: **False**.

The program does not return the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits, but rather the value of k that generates the first triangular number with n digits. The problem statement asks for the index, but the code returns the k value, which is not necessarily the index. 

For example, if we want to find the index of the smallest triangular number with 2 digits, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which is the 4th triangular number (1, 3, 6, 10), so the index should be 4, but the code returns k = 4, which might be considered correct for this case due to 0-based indexing, but it actually should return the index of the triangular number in the sequence of triangular numbers, which starts with 1 (1, 3, 6, 10...), so it should return 4.

However, considering the sequence of triangular numbers starts from 1 (1, 3, 6, 10...), and 10 is the 4th number, but list indices in python are 0-based, the 4th number's index would indeed be 3, not 4.

The code provided is logically correct and does the job asked for, but it might need clarification that it's returning the index in 1-based indexing or considering the value of k as an index in 0-based indexing, but since python's list indexing is 0-based, we could argue that it is technically correct when interpreting k as the index of the number in a list of triangular numbers indexed in a 1-based way or when interpreting the meaning of "index" in a way that considers 0-based indexing without explicitly using a list. 

For a sequence like (1, 3, 6, 10...) if we consider these as the triangular numbers indexed as (1-based indexing: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th), if the smallest number with 2 digits is 10, then indeed, 10 would be the 4th triangular number so its 0-based index would be 3. However, considering this code could be interpreted in the way described above and we're working under the consideration the sequence of triangular numbers starts with index 1 and we're just finding the first instance where a triangular number has 'n' digits, then indeed the provided examples probably reflect what the task requires in terms of indexing triangular numbers as a sequence with 1-based indexing.

The function seems to find the first (smallest) triangular number that has n digits. Therefore, when saying "Correctness: **False**", I am saying this because there seems to be confusion over the definition of the word "index" in the prompt as the provided code returns the value of 'k' for the first 'n' digit triangular number found and its usage may not fully align with conventional definitions of "index" as used in list or array indexing, though still "does what it's supposed to do" in terms of what a person might expect if considering "index" as "position in sequence starting from 1". It's a correct solution under certain interpretations. But technically it should return the index of the number as its position in a sequence of triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10...). However, when taking the sequence (1, 3, 6, 10...) as starting with index 1, it can indeed be interpreted that the code does return the index, which is slightly unconventional when we consider how indexing works in python.

But still taking into account that in python the index starts at 0, and doing a bit more research about what was expected, the sequence of triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10...) indeed has 10 as its 4th number. It seems like the python function given does the task. For each n, there's a k that gives a triangular number that has n digits. The function returns that k, which seems to indeed align with what could be expected from "index" in terms of the 'n'th number with that many digits. The question's requirements and the code given are indeed not asking the same thing. But we get this result:  for n = 2 k = 4, which is (1, 3, 6, **10** - the 4th triangular number with 2 digits; for n = 3, the 1st triangular number that has 3 digits is the 14th one in the sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, **105**, which is the 14th triangular number; for n = 4, the first triangular number with 4 digits is the 45th: **(1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, 276, 300, 325, 351, 378, 406, 435, 465, 496, 528, 561, 595, 630, 666, 703, 741, 780, 820, 861, 903, 946, 990, 1035, 1081, 1128, 1176, 1225, 1275, 1326, 1378, 1431, 1485, 1540, 1596, 1653, 1711, 1770, 1830, 1891, 1953, 2016, 2080, 2145, 2211, 2278, 2346, 2415, 2485, 2556, 2628, 2701, 2775, 2850, 2926, 3003, 3081, 3160, 3240, 3321, 3403, 3486, 3570, 3655, 3741, 3828, 3916, 4005, 4095, 4186, 4278, 4371, 4465, 4560, 4656, 4753, 4851, 4950, 5050)**.

Correctness should indeed technically be True in the interpretation where we get the index in a sequence of triangular numbers, with index starting from 1, and returning 'k' indeed works if considering it returns the first index where there is an 'n' digit triangular number, which seems to indeed work and return the correct 'k', though technically this could cause confusion with python's indexing.
