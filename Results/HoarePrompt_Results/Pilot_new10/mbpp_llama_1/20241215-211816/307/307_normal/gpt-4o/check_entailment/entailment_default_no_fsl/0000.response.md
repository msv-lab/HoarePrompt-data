Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle non-positive integers or non-integers explicitly. The problem description does not explicitly state that the input `n` must be a positive integer, but the provided unit tests suggest this assumption. However, the code will enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results if `n` is not a positive integer. 

For example, if `n` is 0 or a negative number, the function will not be able to find a triangular number with `n` digits, because there is no triangular number with 0 or a negative number of digits. Similarly, if `n` is a non-integer, the function will also not be able to find a triangular number with `n` digits, because the number of digits in a number is always an integer.

To handle these edge cases correctly, the code should explicitly check the type and value of `n` and raise an error or return a special value if `n` is not a positive integer. 

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to handle these edge cases:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1
```
