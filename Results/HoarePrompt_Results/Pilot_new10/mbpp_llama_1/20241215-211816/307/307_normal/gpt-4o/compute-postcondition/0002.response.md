The value of `triangular_number` is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 1, we can substitute this value into the formula to get `triangular_number = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `triangular_number` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1**
