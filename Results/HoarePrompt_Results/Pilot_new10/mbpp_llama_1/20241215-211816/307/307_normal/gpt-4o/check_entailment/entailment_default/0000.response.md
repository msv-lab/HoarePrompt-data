Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle non-positive integers or non-integers explicitly. It assumes that the input `n` will always be a positive integer. However, if `n` is a non-positive integer or a non-integer, the function may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

For example, if `n` is 0, the function will never find a triangular number with 0 digits and will enter an infinite loop. Similarly, if `n` is a negative number or a non-integer, the function will not produce the correct result.

Additionally, the function returns the index `k` of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, not the triangular number itself. However, this is a matter of interpretation and may be what the problem description intended.

A more robust version of the function would include input validation to handle non-positive integers and non-integers explicitly. For example:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1
```
