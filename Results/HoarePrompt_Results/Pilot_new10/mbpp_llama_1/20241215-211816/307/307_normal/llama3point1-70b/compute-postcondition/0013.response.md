To find the output state, we first need to evaluate the expression `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` given that `idx` is 3.

The calculation is as follows: 
`idx * (idx + 1) // 2` = `3 * (3 + 1) // 2` = `3 * 4 // 2` = `12 // 2` = `6`.

Therefore, `triangular_num` is assigned the value `6`.

The states of the other variables, `n` and `idx`, are not affected by this operation. 

So, `n` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `idx` remains 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 6**
