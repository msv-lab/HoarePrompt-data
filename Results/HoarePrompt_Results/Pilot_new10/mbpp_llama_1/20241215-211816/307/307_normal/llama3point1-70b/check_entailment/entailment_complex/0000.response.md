Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. 

Here's why it works:

1. The function `func_1(n)` starts with an index `idx` of 1, which corresponds to the first triangular number (1).
2. It enters a loop where it calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
3. It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`.
4. If it is, the function returns the current `idx`, which is the smallest index that satisfies the condition.
5. If not, it increments `idx` by 1 and repeats the loop.

This process ensures that the function returns the smallest index `idx` such that the `idx`-th triangular number has a length of at least `n` digits.

The key insight here is that the formula for the `idx`-th triangular number is `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, which is an increasing function of `idx`. This means that as `idx` increases, the triangular number also increases, and thus the length of its string representation will eventually reach or exceed `n` digits.

Since the function uses a loop that increments `idx` indefinitely, it will eventually find the smallest `idx` that satisfies the condition, as long as `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
