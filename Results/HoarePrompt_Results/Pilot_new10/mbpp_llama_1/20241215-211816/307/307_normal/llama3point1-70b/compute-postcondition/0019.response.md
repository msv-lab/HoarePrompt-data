To understand the functionality of the given function `func_1(n)`, let's break down what the code does step by step, keeping in mind the potential edge cases and any discrepancies between the code and the annotations.

1. **Function Parameters and Return Value**: The function `func_1(n)` accepts one parameter `n`, which, according to the annotations, is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The function returns an integer value `idx`.

2. **Loop Logic**: Inside the function, there's a while loop that runs indefinitely until it encounters a return statement. Within the loop:
   - It calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
   - It checks if the length of the string representation of the calculated triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If the condition is met, it returns the current value of `idx`.
   - If not, it increments `idx` by 1 and continues the loop.

3. **Return Conditions**: The function returns `idx` as soon as it finds a triangular number whose string representation has a length of at least `n`. This implies that the function is searching for the smallest `idx` that satisfies this condition.

4. **Annotations vs. Code**: The annotations suggest that the function returns one of the values 1, 2, or 3. However, the code does not impose such a restriction. It dynamically calculates and returns the smallest `idx` based on the input `n`, without any predefined limits on `idx` other than it being a positive integer.

5. **Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or is less than 1, as the annotations imply these are the only valid inputs. However, the code itself does not enforce this; it will simply not return for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs because the loop condition and return logic are based on the properties of triangular numbers and string lengths.
   - For very large `n`, the function may take a long time to return or could potentially run into memory issues, though the latter is unlikely given the nature of the calculation.

Given these observations, the functionality of `func_1(n)` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest index `idx` such that the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number has a length of at least `n`. The function dynamically calculates this index without any predefined upper limit. **
