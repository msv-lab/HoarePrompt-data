The code calculates the value of `triangular_num` based on the current value of `idx`. Since `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is calculated as `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which equals `1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1**
