Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. Here's why:

- The function `func_1(n)` starts with `idx = 1`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number (1).
- It enters a loop that calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- The length of the string representation of this triangular number is compared to `n`.
- If the length is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` or more digits.
- The loop increments `idx` by 1 in each iteration, effectively checking each triangular number in ascending order.
- This process guarantees that the function will find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, because it checks each triangular number in order and returns the first one that meets the condition.

For example, if `n = 3`, the function will return the index of the smallest triangular number with at least 3 digits. The first few triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55,... The first one with at least 3 digits is 100, which is the 14th triangular number (since 1 + 2 +... + 14 = 105, and 1 + 2 +... + 13 = 91). The function will correctly return `idx = 14` in this case.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it is correct for all positive integer values of `n`.
