Given the initial state: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 1, `triangular_num` is 1, and the current value of `triangular_num` has a string representation with a length greater than or equal to `n`. 

When the code `return idx` is executed, it simply returns the value of `idx`. Since `idx` is 1, this value is returned as is.

Output State: **The program returns 1**
