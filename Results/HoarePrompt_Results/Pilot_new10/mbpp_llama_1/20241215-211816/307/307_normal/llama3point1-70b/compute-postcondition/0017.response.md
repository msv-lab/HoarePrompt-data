To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. The loop continues indefinitely until it encounters a `return` statement.
2. Inside the loop, the variable `triangular_num` is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, which represents the `idx`-th triangular number.
3. The loop checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. If this condition is true, the function returns the current value of `idx`.
4. If the condition is false, `idx` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe the following patterns:

- `idx` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop returns `idx` when the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- If the loop returns, it means that the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`.

Considering these patterns, we can conclude that the loop will continue until it finds a triangular number whose string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`. At this point, the function will return the index of this triangular number.

The output state after all iterations of the loop have executed can be described as follows:

- The function returns the smallest `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`.
- The value of `idx` after the loop is the same as the returned value, which is the index of the first triangular number whose string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

Output State: **The function returns the smallest `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is greater than or equal to the original value of `n`. The value of `idx` is the same as the returned value. The original value of `n` remains unchanged.**
