According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement. Since the loop body is omitted, we can't determine if there's a `break` statement inside. However, given that it's a `while True` loop, we can conclude that the loop can certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 3**
