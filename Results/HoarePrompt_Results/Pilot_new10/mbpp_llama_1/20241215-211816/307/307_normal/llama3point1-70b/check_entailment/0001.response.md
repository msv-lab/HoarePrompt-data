Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and works as expected for every potential case. It correctly calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.

Here's why:

- The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of digits.
- It initializes a variable `idx` to 1, which will be used to calculate the triangular numbers.
- The function enters a while loop, where it calculates the `triangular_num` using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- It checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns the current value of `idx`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.
- If not, it increments `idx` by 1 and repeats the loop.

This algorithm ensures that it finds the smallest triangular number with n digits, because it checks every triangular number in ascending order and stops as soon as it finds one with n digits.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. It handles all possible inputs, including edge cases like n = 1, and it always returns the correct index. Therefore, the program is correct.
