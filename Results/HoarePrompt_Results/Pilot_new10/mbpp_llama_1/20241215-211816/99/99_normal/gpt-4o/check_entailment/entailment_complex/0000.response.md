Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string, and the provided Python function does exactly that.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

* The function uses 0-based indexing, which means the first character of the string is at index 0 (even), the second character is at index 1 (odd), and so on.
* The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string, and includes only the characters at even indices (i.e., where `i % 2 == 0`).
* The `join` method is used to concatenate the characters at even indices into a single string, which is then returned by the function.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different input strings.

One potential issue is that the function does not explicitly check if the input is a string, and may raise an error if the input is not a string or is `None`. However, this is not explicitly forbidden by the problem description, and the function's behavior is well-defined for string inputs. 

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the annotated program, the program is correct.
