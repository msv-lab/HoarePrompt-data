Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly remove characters with odd index values from a given string. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the input string `s`, selecting characters at even indices (`i % 2 == 0`). These characters are then joined together to form the output string.

The code handles strings of any length, including empty strings, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests (`assert` statements). The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function returns a string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices.

The use of 0-based indexing is also correct, as Python uses 0-based indexing by default. The code does not have any explicit error handling for non-string inputs or `None` inputs, but this is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the problem description. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code appears to be correct.
