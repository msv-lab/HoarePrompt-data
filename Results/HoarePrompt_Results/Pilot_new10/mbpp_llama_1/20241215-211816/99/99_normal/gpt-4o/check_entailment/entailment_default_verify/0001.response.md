Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment seems to be missing. However, the code itself seems to correctly implement the described functionality.

The function `func_1` iterates over the string `s` and returns a new string consisting of characters at even indices (0-based indexing). The provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various inputs.

The output hints also suggest that the function behaves as expected for strings of any length, including empty strings. However, it may raise errors for non-string inputs or if the input is `None`, which is not a concern given the assumption that the input will be a valid string.

Given this information, the code appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
