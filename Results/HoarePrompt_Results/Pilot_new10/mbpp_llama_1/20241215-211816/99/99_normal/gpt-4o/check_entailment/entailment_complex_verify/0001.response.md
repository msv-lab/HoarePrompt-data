To determine the correctness of the program, we first analyze the problem description, which requires writing a Python function to remove characters with odd index values from a given string. The original assessment is "None", indicating no prior evaluation of the program's correctness.

The provided code defines a function `func_1(s)` that uses list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the input string `s`. It selects characters at even indices (since indexing in Python is 0-based, `i % 2 == 0` corresponds to even indices) and joins them into a new string, effectively removing characters at odd indices.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insights into the program's behavior, including its handling of strings of any length and the potential for errors if the input is not a string or is `None`. However, the problem statement assumes valid input (a non-empty string), so these edge cases do not directly impact the assessment of correctness regarding the specific task.

Considering the problem description and the functionality of the provided code, the code accurately implements the requested functionality. It correctly removes characters at odd indices from the input string, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

The original assessment being "None" implies a lack of initial evaluation. However, based on the analysis, the code correctly achieves its intended purpose as defined by the problem statement.

Given the information and analysis, the program is correct according to the problem description. 

Final: **True**
