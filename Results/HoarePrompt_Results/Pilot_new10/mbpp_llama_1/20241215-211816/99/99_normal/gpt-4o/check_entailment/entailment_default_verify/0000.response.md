The problem description asks for a Python function to remove characters at odd index values from a given string. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses list comprehension to iterate over the input string `s` and returns a new string consisting of characters at even indices. 

The original assessment is None, indicating no initial judgment on the program's correctness.

The output hints suggest that the function correctly handles strings of any length, including empty strings, and returns a string with characters at even indices.

Upon reviewing the code and output hints, it appears that the function behaves as intended based on the problem description. The code iterates over the string using a 0-based index and includes characters at even indices in the resulting string, effectively removing characters at odd indices.

Therefore, the original assessment of None can be updated to reflect the program's correctness. The function correctly implements the required functionality, and the output hints support this conclusion.

Final: **True**
