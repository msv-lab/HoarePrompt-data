To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to understand the problem description and the code provided.

The problem description asks to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string. In Python, strings are 0-indexed, meaning the first character is at index 0 (even), the second character is at index 1 (odd), and so on.

The provided code defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string consisting of characters at even indices from `s`. The code uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over the string `s` with a step of 2, starting from index 0. This effectively selects characters at indices 0, 2, 4, 6,..., which are the even indices.

Considering the problem description and the code:

- The problem asks to remove characters at odd indices, which means keeping characters at even indices. This is exactly what the code does by iterating over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0.
- Since Python uses 0-based indexing, the first character (at index 0) is considered even, and the code correctly includes it in the output.
- By skipping over characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5,...), the code effectively removes them from the output string.

Therefore, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The reason for this correctness is that the code accurately implements the required operation of removing characters at odd indices from a given string by only selecting characters at even indices, thus adhering to the problem description.
