Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(s)`, correctly implements the problem description's requirement to remove characters at odd index values from a given string `s`. It uses a generator expression within the `join()` method to iterate over the string `s`, selecting characters at even indices (i.e., indices where `i % 2 == 0`), and returns a new string consisting of these characters.

The function handles all potential cases, including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings of varying lengths. For instance:
- For an empty string `""`, the function correctly returns `""`.
- For a single-character string `"a"`, the function correctly returns `"a"` since the single character is at an even index (0).
- For a string of varying lengths, such as `"abcdef"`, the function correctly returns `"ace"`, which consists of characters at even indices (0, 2, 4).

The output hints provide a description of the code's functionality that aligns with the observed behavior, confirming the program's correctness for all potential cases mentioned. Since no case can be identified where the program does not meet the problem description's requirements, the correctness of the program is deemed to be **True**.
