The original assessment appears to be accurate. The provided Python program correctly implements a function to calculate the n'th Lucas number, which follows a modified Fibonacci-like sequence. The base cases are correctly handled, and the iterative approach ensures that the n'th Lucas number is calculated correctly for any non-negative integer `n`.

The output hints provided align with the problem description and the code functionality. They describe the function as accepting a non-negative integer `n` and returning the n'th term of a sequence where the 0th term is 2, the 1st term is 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding ones. This matches the behavior of the provided Python program.

There is no indication from the output hints or the problem description that the original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly calculates the Lucas numbers according to the given sequence definition, and the original assessment correctly identified the program as being correct for all potential cases.

Final: **True**
