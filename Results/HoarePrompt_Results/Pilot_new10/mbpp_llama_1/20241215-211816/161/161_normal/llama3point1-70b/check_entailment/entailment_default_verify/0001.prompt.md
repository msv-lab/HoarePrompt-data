You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(n)` to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with the first two numbers being 2 and 1, and each subsequent number being the sum of the previous two.

The function uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1` are correctly handled, returning 2 and 1 respectively.

For `n > 1`, the function uses a loop to iteratively calculate the Lucas numbers up to the n'th number. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n + 1` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value). In each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to `b` and `a + b` respectively, effectively calculating the next Lucas number.

The function finally returns the value of `b`, which is the n'th Lucas number.

After analyzing the code, it appears to be correct for all potential cases. It correctly handles the base cases, and the iterative approach ensures that the n'th Lucas number is calculated correctly for any positive integer `n`. 

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on a modified Fibonacci-like sequence where the 0th term is 2, the 1st term is 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding ones, thus returning 2 for `n = 0`, 1 for `n = 1`, and the `n`th term of this sequence for `n > 1`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
