The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The original assessment claims that the provided Python program correctly implements this function. 

However, the annotated version of the code reveals a crucial detail: it states that after the for loop, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number, and `b` is the nth Fibonacci number. This implies that the function is actually calculating Fibonacci numbers, not Lucas numbers. 

Lucas numbers are similar to Fibonacci numbers, but with the first two numbers being 2 and 1, and each subsequent number being the sum of the previous two. The Fibonacci sequence, on the other hand, starts with 0 and 1. 

The provided code correctly calculates the Lucas sequence, as the base cases are handled correctly (2 for n = 0, and 1 for n = 1), and the subsequent terms are calculated as the sum of the previous two terms. 

However, the annotations and the original assessment are inconsistent. The original assessment claims the program is correct for calculating Lucas numbers, which is true, but the annotations claim the program calculates Fibonacci numbers, which is false.

The reason for the discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the Lucas sequence and the Fibonacci sequence have similar recurrence relations, and the provided code can be easily adapted to calculate either sequence by changing the base cases. 

Given this information, it appears that the original assessment was accurate, as the program does correctly calculate the n'th Lucas number. The annotations, however, contain an error in their description of the program's functionality.

Final: **True**
