Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided implements a function to find the n'th Lucas number, which is a modified Fibonacci-like sequence where the 0th term is 2, the 1st term is 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding ones. 

Upon examining the code, we see that it correctly handles the base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, returning 2 and 1, respectively. For `n > 1`, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1) and then iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two Lucas numbers calculated so far. After the loop, `b` holds the `n`th Lucas number, which is then returned.

The output hints agree with the code, describing the function's behavior accurately. They specify that the function returns the 0th term (2) for `n = 0`, the 1st term (1) for `n = 1`, and the `n`th term of the sequence for `n > 1`, which is exactly what the provided code does.

Given the implementation, there are no visible cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The logic for calculating the n'th Lucas number is correctly implemented, covering all non-negative integers `n`. 

Therefore, the code correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case.
