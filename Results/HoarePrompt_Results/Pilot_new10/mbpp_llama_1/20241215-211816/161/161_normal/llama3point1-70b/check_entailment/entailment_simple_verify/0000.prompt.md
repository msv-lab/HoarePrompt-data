You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the Lucas sequence, which is a sequence of integers similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The program correctly handles the base cases where n is 0 or 1, and for n greater than 1, it uses a loop to calculate the nth Lucas number.

The program's logic is sound and it handles all potential cases. It does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle. The loop iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), and in each iteration, it updates the values of a and b to the next two numbers in the sequence. Finally, it returns the nth Lucas number, which is the value of b after the loop.

For example, if n is 5, the program will calculate the Lucas sequence as follows:

- a = 2, b = 1 (initial values)
- a = 1, b = 3 (after first iteration)
- a = 3, b = 4 (after second iteration)
- a = 4, b = 7 (after third iteration)
- a = 7, b = 11 (after fourth iteration)

So, the 5th Lucas number is 11, which is the correct result.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number, `b` is the nth Fibonacci number
            return b
            #The program returns the nth Fibonacci number


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
