Correctness: **True**

The provided code is a solution to find the n'th Lucas number, and it appears to be correct. 

The Lucas sequence is a series of numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The Lucas sequence is defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The given function `func_1(n)` matches this definition. It starts with the base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, and then uses a loop to calculate the `n`-th Lucas number for `n > 1`. 

The provided unit tests `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7` agree with the Lucas sequence:
- L(9) = 76
- L(4) = 7
- L(3) = 4

The function also handles the edge cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1` correctly, as specified in the problem description.

Since the code matches the definition of the Lucas sequence, correctly handles the edge cases, and passes the provided unit tests, I conclude that it is correct.
