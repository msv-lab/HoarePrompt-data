The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and then adds the original value of `a` to the new value of `b`. Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4. After the swap, `a` becomes 4 and `b` becomes 3 + 4 = 7. 

The value of `n` is not affected by this code, so it remains a non-negative integer larger than 3.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 3, `a` is 4, `b` is 7**
