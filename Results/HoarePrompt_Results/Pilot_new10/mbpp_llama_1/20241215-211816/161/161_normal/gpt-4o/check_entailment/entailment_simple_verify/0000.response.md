The original assessment claims that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is indeed similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The function's logic aligns with this definition: it correctly handles the base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, and for `n > 1`, it iteratively calculates the n'th Lucas number.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment by detailing the state of the program at various stages, particularly after the loop that calculates the Lucas numbers. It correctly identifies that after the loop, `b` holds the nth Lucas number, given that `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1. This aligns with the definition and calculation method of Lucas numbers.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function for certain inputs, which further reinforces the original assessment.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, the annotated version, and the unit tests, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is inaccurate. The function correctly implements the Lucas sequence calculation for all non-negative integer inputs `n`, as described.

Final: **True**
