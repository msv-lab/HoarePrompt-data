You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The function uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. It handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively.
2. For `n > 1`, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1).
3. It then enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two Lucas numbers calculated so far.
4. After the loop finishes, `b` holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function works correctly for certain inputs. The function's logic is sound and correctly implements the Lucas sequence calculation. 

Therefore, based on the given code and problem description, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases, and no example can be found where the program does not work as expected.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where `n` equals 0 returns 2, `n` equals 1 returns 1, and for `n` larger than 1, it returns the nth number in the sequence

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
