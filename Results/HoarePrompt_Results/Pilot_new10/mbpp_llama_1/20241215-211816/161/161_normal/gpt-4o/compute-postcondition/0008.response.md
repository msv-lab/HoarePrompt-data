The code simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b` based on their previous values. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 1. The new value of `b` becomes the sum of the old `a` and the old `b`, which is 2 + 1 = 3.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
