Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to find the nth Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a sequence of numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. 

The function `func_1` provided seems to calculate the nth Fibonacci-like number correctly, but it does not actually calculate the nth Lucas number when n is greater than 1. The function is supposed to return the nth Lucas number, but it actually returns the (n+1)th Lucas number, because the loop in the function runs from 2 to n+1, effectively calculating the (n+1)th number in the sequence instead of the nth.

For example, `func_1(1)` returns 1 which is correct, but `func_1(2)` should return 3 (which is the 3rd Lucas number), but the function `func_1(2)` returns 4. This can be seen in the unit test `assert func_1(3) == 4`. 

A correct function to calculate the nth Lucas number should be:

```python
def lucas(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```
But with the loop running from 2 to n (not n+1) like this:
```python
def lucas(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b
```
