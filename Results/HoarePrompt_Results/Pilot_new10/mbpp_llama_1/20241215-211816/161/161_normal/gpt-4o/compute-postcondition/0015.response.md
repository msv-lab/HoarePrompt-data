The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. The function returns a value based on the value of `n`. 

Case_1: If the condition for this case is met, the function returns 2. 
Case_2: If the condition for this case is met, the function returns 1. 
Case_3: If the conditions for the previous cases are not met, and `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1, the function returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return a specific number based on the value of `n`, following the rules of a Fibonacci-like sequence with starting numbers 2 and 1 for `n` larger than 1, and predefined values for `n` equal to 0 and 1.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns `2` if n equals 0, `1` if n equals 1, and the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1 for n larger than 1.**
