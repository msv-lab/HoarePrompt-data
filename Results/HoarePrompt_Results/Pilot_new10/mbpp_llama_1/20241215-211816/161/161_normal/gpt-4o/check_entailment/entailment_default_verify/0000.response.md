The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The function's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the Lucas sequence calculation. The provided unit tests also confirm that the function works correctly for certain inputs.

The output hints further support this assessment by describing the function's behavior accurately. It accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1. This matches the expected behavior of calculating the n'th Lucas number.

Given the problem description and the code provided, the original assessment seems accurate. The function correctly handles the base cases and uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number for `n > 1`. The output hints and the unit tests support this conclusion.

Therefore, based on the given information, the program appears to correctly implement the calculation of the n'th Lucas number.

Final: **True**
