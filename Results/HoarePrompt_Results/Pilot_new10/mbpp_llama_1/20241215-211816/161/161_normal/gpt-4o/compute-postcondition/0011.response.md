According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 4. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used, but we can infer that it takes the values in the range. Since the loop has already executed at least once (with `_` being 2), for the loop to execute again, `_` would be 3 or more, but since we are only interested in the state at the start of the next iteration, we consider the next value `_` would take, which is not explicitly used but implies the progression of the loop. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the last value `_` took, which is 3 or more, so `n` must be greater than 3, but since `n` was already larger than 2, and the loop starts from 2, it means `n` needs to be at least 4 for the loop to execute with `_` being 3, and then 5 or more for it to execute again after that. Since we are looking at the state for the loop to execute one more time after the last iteration (where `_` would have been 3), `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to have executed with `_` as 3, and for it to execute again, `n` needs to be at least 5.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
