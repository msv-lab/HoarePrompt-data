According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since the loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive), for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is larger than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1, the condition that `n` must be at least 2 is already satisfied by the conditions that `n` is larger than 0 and `n` is not equal to 1, because the only other possible non-negative integer value of `n` that is larger than 0 and not equal to 1 is 2 or more.

The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used within the loop body, so we do not need to consider its value. However, the loop will start from 2, so after the first iteration, the value of `_` would be 2 if we were to use it.

The initial values of `a` and `b` are given but do not affect the execution of the loop directly. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
