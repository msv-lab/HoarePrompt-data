To solve this, let's first understand what a Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1 means. In a standard Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. However, in this case, we start with 2 and 1. So, the sequence would be 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, and so on.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci-like number, and `b` is the nth Fibonacci-like number in this sequence.

The sequence looks like this:
- 1st number: 2
- 2nd number: 1
- 3rd number: 2 + 1 = 3
- 4th number: 1 + 3 = 4
- 5th number: 3 + 4 = 7
- 6th number: 4 + 7 = 11
- 7th number: 7 + 11 = 18
- And so on.

Since `n` is larger than 1, `b` (the nth number) will always be a number in this sequence that is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from the third number (which is 3).

The program simply returns `b`, which is the nth Fibonacci-like number in the sequence starting with 2 and 1.

Output State: **The program returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where n is a non-negative integer larger than 1.**
