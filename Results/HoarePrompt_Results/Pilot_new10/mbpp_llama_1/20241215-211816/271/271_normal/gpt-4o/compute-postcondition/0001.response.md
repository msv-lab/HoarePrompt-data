The given code initializes an empty list `averages`. The initial state variables `tuples` and `num_elements` are not affected by this code. 

`averages` is now an empty list, `tuples` is still a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, and `num_elements` is still equal to the length of any inner tuple.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is an empty list**
