#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        
        averages.append(avg)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is a list containing the averages of elements at each position across all inner tuples, `i` is `num_elements - 1` if `num_elements` is greater than 0, otherwise, the loop does not execute and `averages` remains an empty list.
    return averages
    #The program returns a list of averages where each average corresponds to the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`, with the list having a length equal to `num_elements`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples with the same length and containing numbers, and returns a list of averages where each average is the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples. However, it does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty, or where inner tuples are of different lengths, or where inner tuples contain non-numeric values, potentially raising IndexError or TypeError in such scenarios.
