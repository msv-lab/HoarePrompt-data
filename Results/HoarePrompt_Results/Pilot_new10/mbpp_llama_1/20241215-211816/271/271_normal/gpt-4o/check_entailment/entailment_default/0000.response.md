Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty, or where inner tuples are of different lengths, or where inner tuples contain non-numeric values. For example, if the input is `func_1(())`, the code will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access `tuples[0]`. Similarly, if the input is `func_1(((1, 2, 3), (4, 5)))`, the code will also raise an `IndexError` because it assumes all inner tuples have the same length. Furthermore, if the input is `func_1(((1, 2, 'a'), (4, 5, 6)))`, the code will raise a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the average of non-numeric values. The code only works correctly when the input tuple is non-empty and contains inner tuples of the same length with numeric values. 

Therefore, since the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, Correctness is **False**.
