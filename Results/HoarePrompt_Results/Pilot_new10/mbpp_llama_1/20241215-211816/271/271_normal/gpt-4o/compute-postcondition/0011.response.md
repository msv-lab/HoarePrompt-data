The code updates the `elements_at_position` list by selecting the elements at index `i` from each inner tuple in `tuples`. 

Given that `i` is 2, this means it will select the third elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`. 

Since `num_elements` is greater than 2 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, all inner tuples have at least 3 elements, so this operation is valid.

The value of `elements_at_position` is updated to be a list containing the third elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The initial `elements_at_position` was a list containing the third elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`, which is the same as its updated value, so the value of `elements_at_position` does not change in this case.

However, this is not always the case and depends on the initial value of `i`. 

In the general case, `elements_at_position` will be updated to be a list containing the `i-th` elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 2 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is a list, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the elements at the current position `i` in all inner tuples in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum` of the third elements of all inner tuples divided by `len(tuples)`**
