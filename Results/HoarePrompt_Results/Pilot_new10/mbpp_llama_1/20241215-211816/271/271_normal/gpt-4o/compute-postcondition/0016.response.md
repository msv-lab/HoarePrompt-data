The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of averages where each average corresponds to the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`.
