To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is a list comprehension that creates a new list `elements_at_position` containing the elements at the current position `i` from each inner tuple in `tuples`.

Given the initial state:
- `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
- `num_elements` is greater than 0 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple.
- `averages` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.

The list comprehension `[t[i] for t in tuples]` will iterate over each inner tuple `t` in `tuples` and extract the element at index `i`. Since `i` is 0, it will extract the first element from each inner tuple.

The resulting list `elements_at_position` will contain the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.

The states of `tuples`, `num_elements`, `averages`, and `i` are not changed by this operation. Only a new list `elements_at_position` is created.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
- `num_elements` is greater than 0 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple.
- `averages` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the elements at position `i` (which is 0) from each inner tuple in `tuples`, essentially the first elements of all inner tuples.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 0 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.**
