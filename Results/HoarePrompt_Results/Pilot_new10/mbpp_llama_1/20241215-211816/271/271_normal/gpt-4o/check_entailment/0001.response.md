Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

The program works as follows:

- It first determines the number of elements in each tuple by checking the length of the first tuple.
- It then iterates over each position in the tuples.
- For each position, it extracts the elements at that position from all tuples using a list comprehension.
- It calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the total number of tuples.
- Finally, it appends the calculated average to the `averages` list, which is returned as the result.

The program correctly handles the case where the tuples have the same length, which is a requirement according to the problem description. The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the program works correctly for different inputs.

There are no obvious edge cases that the program does not handle, such as handling tuples with different lengths (which is not a valid input according to the problem description), or handling tuples with non-numeric values (which would cause a TypeError when trying to calculate the sum).

Overall, based on the provided code and problem description, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
