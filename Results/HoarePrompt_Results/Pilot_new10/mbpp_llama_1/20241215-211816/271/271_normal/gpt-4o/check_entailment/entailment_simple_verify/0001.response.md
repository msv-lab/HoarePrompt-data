The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial opinion on the correctness of the program. 

The problem description asks for a function that calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in a tuple of tuples. 

Upon reviewing the provided code, it appears to correctly implement this functionality. The function `func_1` iterates over each position in the inner tuples, calculates the average of the values at that position across all tuples, and appends this average to the `averages` list.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the state of the program at different points, but it does not reveal any issues with the original code. The annotations are consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
