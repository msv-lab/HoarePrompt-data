The problem description asks for a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. 

The original assessment is None, which means there is no initial opinion on the program's correctness.

However, upon examining the provided code, we can see that it uses the `zip(*tuples)` expression to transpose the input tuples, effectively grouping corresponding values together. Then, it calculates the average of each group using `sum(val) / len(tuples)`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that this is indeed the program's behavior, and the returned list contains the averages of corresponding values from each tuple.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the program is correct.

The reason for this conclusion is that the program accurately implements the described functionality: it calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple and returns the results as a list.

Final: **True**
