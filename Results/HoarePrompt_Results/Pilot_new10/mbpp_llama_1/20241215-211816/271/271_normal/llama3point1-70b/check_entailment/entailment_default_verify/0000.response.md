The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

However, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, we can make an assessment of the program's correctness.

The code `def func_1(tuples): return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

The output hints mention that the function may raise exceptions for invalid inputs such as empty tuples, non-numeric values, or tuples of different lengths. However, since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Given that the code correctly implements the requested functionality and the output hints do not indicate any deviation from the expected behavior for valid inputs, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
