The function accepts a tuple of tuples with numbers of the same length, and returns a list of averages where each average corresponds to the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples, but it may raise exceptions for invalid inputs such as empty tuples, non-numeric values, or tuples of different lengths.
