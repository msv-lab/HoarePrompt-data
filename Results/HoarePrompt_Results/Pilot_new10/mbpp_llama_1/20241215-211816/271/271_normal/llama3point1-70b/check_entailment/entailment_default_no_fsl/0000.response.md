Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully align with the problem description for every potential case. The main issue with the given code is that it does not handle edge cases such as empty tuples, non-numeric values, or tuples of different lengths.

1. **Empty Tuples**: If an empty tuple is passed to the function, `zip(*tuples)` will return an empty list, and thus, the list comprehension will not raise any immediate errors because there will be no divisions by zero. However, the function does not explicitly handle this case, and depending on the context, the desired behavior might be to raise an exception or return a specific value.

2. **Non-Numeric Values**: The code does not check if the values in the tuples are numeric. If the tuples contain non-numeric values, a `TypeError` will be raised when the program tries to calculate the sum. The problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, but a robust solution would handle this scenario.

3. **Tuples of Different Lengths**: `zip(*tuples)` will stop at the end of the shortest input tuple, effectively ignoring any extra elements in longer tuples. This behavior might be unexpected and could lead to incorrect averages if the user is unaware of it.

For example, if we have `tuples = ((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, `zip(*tuples)` will return `[(1, 3), (2, 4)]`, ignoring the `5` in the second tuple.

To make the code correct for every potential case, additional error checking and handling should be implemented to manage these edge cases according to the expected behavior defined by the problem description.
