The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to compare it with the problem description and the output hints. The problem description asks for a function that splits a given list into two parts where the length of the first part is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. 

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple of two lists: `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`. This operation effectively splits the list into two parts at the index `L`.

The output hints describe the expected behavior of the function in various scenarios:
- If `L` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, the first list contains all elements of `lst` and the second list is empty.
- If `L` is 0, the first list is empty and the second list contains all elements of `lst`.
- If `lst` is empty, both lists in the tuple are empty.

Comparing the code with the output hints, we can see that the code behaves as expected in all these scenarios:
- If `L` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst[:L]` will return all elements of `lst` (because `lst[:len(lst)]` or `lst[:n]` where `n` is greater than `len(lst)` will just return the whole list), and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list (because `lst[n:]` where `n` is greater than or equal to `len(lst)` returns an empty list).
- If `L` is 0, `lst[:0]` will return an empty list, and `lst[0:]` will return all elements of `lst`.
- If `lst` is empty, `lst[:L]` will be an empty list regardless of `L`, and `lst[L:]` will also be an empty list because we're already at the end of the list.

Since the code behaves as described in the problem and the output hints, and it handles all the scenarios correctly according to these descriptions, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
