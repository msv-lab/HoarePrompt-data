Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and returns a tuple of two lists. The first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst` (`lst[:L]`), and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst` (`lst[L:]`).

This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to split the given list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- When `L` is 0, the first list is empty, and the second list contains all elements of `lst`.
- When `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first list contains all elements of `lst`, and the second list is empty.
- When `L` is between 0 and the length of `lst`, the first list contains the first `L` elements, and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The program's use of list slicing (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) ensures that the split is performed correctly and efficiently, without modifying the original list. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
