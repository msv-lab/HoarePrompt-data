Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the given integer L. The function `func_1(lst, L)` returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list includes the first L elements of the input list `lst`, and the second list includes the remaining elements of `lst`. 

The code handles various potential cases, including:

- When L is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, the first list contains all elements of `lst` and the second list is empty.
- When L is 0, the first list is empty and the second list contains all elements of `lst`.
- When `lst` is empty, both lists in the tuple are empty.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality and provide examples of different scenarios, but they do not reveal any missing logic or edge cases that the code fails to handle. Therefore, based on the given problem description and output hints, the code appears to work correctly for every potential case.
