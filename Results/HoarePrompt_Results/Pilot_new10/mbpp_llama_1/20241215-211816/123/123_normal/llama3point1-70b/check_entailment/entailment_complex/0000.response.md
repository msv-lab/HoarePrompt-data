Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and returns a tuple of two lists where the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst` and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

- When `L` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst[:L]` returns all elements of `lst` because Python's list slicing automatically stops at the end of the list if the specified end index is greater than the list length. In this case, `lst[L:]` returns an empty list because there are no remaining elements.

- When `L` is 0, `lst[:L]` returns an empty list because the slice starts at index 0 and ends at index 0, excluding any elements. In this case, `lst[L:]` returns all elements of `lst` because `L` is 0, so the slice starts at the beginning of the list.

- When `lst` is empty, both `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]` return empty lists because there are no elements to slice.

The program handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description, including edge cases like empty lists and `L` being greater than the list length. Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description requires.
