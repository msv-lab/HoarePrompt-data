You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: lst is a list and L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
```
def func_1(lst, L):
```
Output: To understand the impact of the code on the program, let's break down the given information and the code itself.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `lst` is a list.
   - `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`.
   
2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code `return lst[:L], lst[L:]` is splitting the list `lst` into two parts at the index `L`.
   - `lst[:L]` returns a slice of the list from the start up to, but not including, the element at index `L`.
   - `lst[L:]` returns a slice of the list from the element at index `L` to the end of the list.

Given that `L` can be any non-negative integer up to the length of `lst`, the slices returned can vary as follows:
- If `L = 0`, `lst[:L]` will be an empty list `[]`, and `lst[L:]` will be the entire list `lst`.
- If `L = len(lst)`, `lst[:L]` will be the entire list `lst`, and `lst[L:]` will be an empty list `[]`.
- For any `L` where `0 < L < len(lst)`, the list will be split into two non-empty parts at index `L`.

**Output State**: **The program returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.**

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
