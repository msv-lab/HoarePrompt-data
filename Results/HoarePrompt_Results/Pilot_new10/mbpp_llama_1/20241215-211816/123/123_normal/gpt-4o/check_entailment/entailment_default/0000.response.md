Correctness: **True**

The code provided, `def func_1(lst, L): return (lst[:L], lst[L:])`, accurately splits the input list into two parts at the specified index `L`. It returns these two parts as a tuple, with the first part containing elements from the start of the list up to but not including the element at the specified index `L`, and the second part containing elements from the specified index `L` to the end of the list.

The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function splits the input list into two parts at the specified index and returns these two parts in the manner described above. 

All provided assertions demonstrate the function's correct behavior for various input lists and split indices. For instance, `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3)` correctly returns `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`, and `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2)` correctly returns `(['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])`. These examples, along with the function's simple and straightforward implementation, suggest that the function behaves as intended for all potential cases.

Additionally, the code handles edge cases implicitly, such as when `L` is 0 (returning an empty list as the first part and the entire original list as the second part) or when `L` equals the length of the list (returning the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part), because Python's list slicing (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) naturally handles these cases.

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and examples, the function appears to work correctly for all potential cases, including edge cases.
