The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. `lst` is a list, and `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. After executing the function body, the function returns two lists. The first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and return two lists split from `lst` at index `L`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.**
