Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I have reviewed the accuracy of the original assessment.

The original assessment is "None", which implies a lack of judgment on the program's correctness.

Upon examining the code, it indeed seems to accomplish what the problem description asks for: it splits the input list into two parts at the specified index `L`. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple of two lists: the first `L` elements of `lst` and the remaining elements of `lst`.

The output hints further reinforce this understanding by explaining that the function splits the input list into two parts at the specified index and returns these two parts.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the program is correct.

Final: **True**
