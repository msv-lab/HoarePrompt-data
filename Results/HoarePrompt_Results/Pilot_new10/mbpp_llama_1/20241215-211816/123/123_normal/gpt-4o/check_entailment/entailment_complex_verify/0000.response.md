The original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial assessment provided. However, based on the problem description and the provided code, we can evaluate the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function that takes a list and an integer L as input and splits the list into two parts, where the first part has a length of L. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns two lists: `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`.

The annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the function's behavior, which matches the problem description. The function correctly splits the input list into two parts at the specified index L.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
