The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` as parameters, where `L` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. The function splits the input list `lst` into two parts at the index `L`. 

The code `return lst[:L], lst[L:]` is a list slicing operation that splits the list into two parts. `lst[:L]` returns a slice of the list from the start up to, but not including, the element at index `L`, and `lst[L:]` returns a slice of the list from the element at index `L` to the end of the list.

The function can handle various edge cases, including when `L = 0`, `L = len(lst)`, and `0 < L < len(lst)`. 

- If `L = 0`, the function returns an empty list `[]` and the entire list `lst`. 
- If `L = len(lst)`, the function returns the entire list `lst` and an empty list `[]`.
- For any `L` where `0 < L < len(lst)`, the function splits the list into two non-empty parts at index `L`.

The function returns two lists, with no error handling for cases where `L` is outside the specified range or where `lst` is not a list. However, according to the provided information, it is assumed that `L` is a non-negative integer and `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. The functionality of the function is to split the input list into two parts at the specified index `L` and return these two parts.

Functionality: ** The function splits the input list into two parts at the specified index and returns these two parts, with the first part containing elements from the start of the list up to but not including the element at the specified index, and the second part containing elements from the specified index to the end of the list. **
