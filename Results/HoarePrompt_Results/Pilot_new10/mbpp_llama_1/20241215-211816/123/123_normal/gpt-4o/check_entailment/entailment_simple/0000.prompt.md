You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3) == ([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2) == (['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])
assert func_1(['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], 4) == (['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
    #To understand the impact of the code on the program, let's break down the given information and the code itself.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `lst` is a list.
    #   - `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`.
    #   
    #2. **Code Analysis**:
    #   - The code `return lst[:L], lst[L:]` is splitting the list `lst` into two parts at the index `L`.
    #   - `lst[:L]` returns a slice of the list from the start up to, but not including, the element at index `L`.
    #   - `lst[L:]` returns a slice of the list from the element at index `L` to the end of the list.
    #
    #Given that `L` can be any non-negative integer up to the length of `lst`, the slices returned can vary as follows:
    #- If `L = 0`, `lst[:L]` will be an empty list `[]`, and `lst[L:]` will be the entire list `lst`.
    #- If `L = len(lst)`, `lst[:L]` will be the entire list `lst`, and `lst[L:]` will be an empty list `[]`.
    #- For any `L` where `0 < L < len(lst)`, the list will be split into two non-empty parts at index `L`.
    #
    #**Output State**: **The program returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.**

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
