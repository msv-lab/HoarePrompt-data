Correctness: **False**.

The code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. The problem description specifically asks for a function to convert a list to a tuple, implying that the input should be a list. However, the provided function `func_1` can take any iterable object (like strings, sets, etc.), convert it into a tuple, and return the resulting tuple. 

For example, if the input is a string 'hello', `func_1` will return `('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')`, which is not in line with the problem description that asks to convert a list to a tuple. 

Additionally, if the input is not an iterable object, the function will raise an error. For instance, if the input is an integer `5`, `func_1` will raise a TypeError because integers are not iterable.

To meet the requirements of the problem description, the function should check if the input is a list and, if not, either raise a specific error or return a specific value indicating that the input is not a list. 

Therefore, the current implementation does not correctly handle every potential case as per the problem description.
