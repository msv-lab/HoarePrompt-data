Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which converts an iterable (like a list) into a tuple.

Here's why the function works correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Type Conversion**: The `tuple()` function correctly converts a list of any size and containing any type of elements (integers, floats, strings, etc.) into a tuple.
2. **Handling Empty Lists**: Although not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, `func_1` also correctly handles an empty list `[]` by returning an empty tuple `()`.
3. **Handling Non-List Inputs**: If a non-list input is provided to `func_1`, it will still work as long as the input is an iterable (like a string, another tuple, etc.), because `tuple()` can convert any iterable into a tuple. However, if a non-iterable input (like an integer) is provided, the function will raise a `TypeError`. This behavior might or might not be considered correct based on the specific requirements of the problem description, but in the context of converting a list to a tuple, it is typically expected that the input will be a list or at least an iterable.
4. **Input Validation**: The function does not include any input validation to ensure that the input is indeed a list. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem, such validation might be necessary. However, based solely on the provided problem description ("Write a function to convert a list to a tuple"), the function behaves as expected for list inputs.

In summary, for the task of converting a list to a tuple as described, the function works correctly for all potential cases of list inputs, including lists of different lengths and containing different types of elements.
