Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple. The `tuple()` function in Python is used to convert an iterable (like a list) into a tuple. This function works correctly for all potential cases, as it handles lists of varying lengths and with different types of elements.

The unit tests provided also support this conclusion, as they demonstrate the function's ability to correctly convert lists of integers into tuples. Additionally, the function does not have any edge cases that would cause it to fail, such as handling empty lists or lists with non-integer elements.

To further verify the correctness of the function, we can consider the following test cases:
- An empty list: `func_1([])` should return `()`, which it does.
- A list with a single element: `func_1([5])` should return `(5,)`, which it does.
- A list with duplicate elements: `func_1([2, 2, 3])` should return `(2, 2, 3)`, which it does.
- A list with negative numbers: `func_1([-1, -2, -3])` should return `(-1, -2, -3)`, which it does.

In all these cases, the function works as expected, and therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
