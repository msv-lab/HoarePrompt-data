To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify that it indeed converts a list to a tuple as per the problem description.

The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert it into a tuple. This function call essentially creates a new tuple that contains all elements from the input list `lst`.

Let's examine the provided unit tests:

1. `assert func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]) == (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`
2. `assert func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]) == (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`
3. `assert func_1([58, 44, 56]) == (58, 44, 56)`

All these unit tests pass because the function correctly converts the input lists into tuples.

The reason why this program always does what the problem description says is that it utilizes the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which is specifically designed to convert iterable objects (like lists) into tuples. This function works for lists of any size and containing any type of elements, ensuring that every potential case is handled correctly.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program indeed meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
