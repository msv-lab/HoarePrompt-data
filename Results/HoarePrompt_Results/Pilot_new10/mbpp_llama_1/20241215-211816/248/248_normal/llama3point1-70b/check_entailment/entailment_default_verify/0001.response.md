To assess the correctness of the program based on the problem description and output hints provided, let's analyze the key components:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that converts a list into a tuple. This implies that the function should take a list as input and return a tuple that contains all elements from the input list.

2. **Program Provided**: The function `func_1(input_list)` does exactly that. It uses Python's built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input list into a tuple. This is a standard and correct way to perform such a conversion in Python.

3. **Original Assessment**: There is no original assessment provided, so we cannot evaluate its accuracy or relevance.

4. **Output Hints**: The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected based on the problem description. It states that the function accepts an input list and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list, effectively converting the input list into a tuple.

Based on the analysis above, the function `func_1` accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The output hints support this conclusion by describing the function's behavior as aligning with the task of converting a list to a tuple.

Therefore, considering the function does exactly what the problem asks for (converting a list to a tuple) and the output hints confirm this behavior without indicating any discrepancies, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
