To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's break down the provided information:

1. **Annotated Code**: The function takes an `input_list` and returns a tuple that contains all elements from the `input_list`. This is directly implemented in the line `return tuple(input_list)`, which explicitly converts the input list into a tuple and returns it.

2. **Return Postconditions**: The program returns a tuple containing all elements from the `input_list`. This matches the description in the annotated code.

Given this information, we can analyze the functionality:

- The function accepts a parameter `input_list`.
- It returns a tuple containing all elements from the `input_list`.

The code does exactly what the annotations and return postconditions describe. There are no apparent missing edge cases or functionality based on the provided code and descriptions. The conversion of a list to a tuple in Python includes all elements from the list, maintaining their order, which aligns with the described behavior.

However, potential edge cases to consider in a broader context (though not explicitly mentioned in the annotations or return postconditions) include:

- **Empty List**: If `input_list` is an empty list `[]`, the function will return an empty tuple `()`.
- **Non-List Input**: If `input_list` is not a list but another iterable (like a set, dictionary, or string), the function will still return a tuple containing all elements from the input, assuming the input is iterable. If the input is not iterable, a `TypeError` will be raised.
- **Nested Lists or Other Complex Structures**: If `input_list` contains nested lists or other complex structures, these will be converted to tuples in the same structure, meaning a list within the input list will become a tuple within the output tuple.

Given the straightforward nature of the provided code and descriptions, the primary functionality can be summarized without extensively detailing these edge cases, but acknowledging them provides a more comprehensive understanding of the function's behavior.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an input list and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list, effectively converting the input list into a tuple. **
