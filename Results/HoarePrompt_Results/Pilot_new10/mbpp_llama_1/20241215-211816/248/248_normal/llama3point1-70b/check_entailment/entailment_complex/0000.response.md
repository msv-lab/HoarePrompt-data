To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it in relation to the problem description provided.

The problem description asks for a function that converts a list to a tuple. The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes an input list (`input_list`) and returns a tuple created from this input list using the `tuple()` function.

Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function is designed to accept a list as input and return a tuple. This directly aligns with the problem description's requirement of converting a list to a tuple.

2. **Input Handling**: The function can handle any list as input. The problem description does not specify any constraints on the list (such as size, content type, etc.), and the provided function does not impose any either. It works with any list, converting it into a tuple.

3. **Output**: The function returns a tuple that contains all elements from the input list. This is exactly what the problem description requiresâ€”a conversion of the input list into a tuple, preserving all elements.

Given this analysis, it's clear that the program does exactly what the problem description asks for. It converts any input list into a tuple, including all elements from the list, without imposing any additional constraints or requirements not specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as it meets the problem description's requirements without exception.

Correctness: **True**
