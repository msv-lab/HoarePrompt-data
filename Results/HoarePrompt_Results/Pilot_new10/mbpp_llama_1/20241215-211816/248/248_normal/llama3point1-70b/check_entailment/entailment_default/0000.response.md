Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that accepts an input list and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list, effectively converting the input list into a tuple. This directly aligns with the problem description to convert a list to a tuple.

The output hints also confirm this functionality, stating that the function returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

Upon examining the code and considering various potential cases, it appears that the function will work correctly for all possible inputs. For instance:

- Empty lists: The function will correctly return an empty tuple.
- Lists containing a single element: The function will correctly return a tuple containing that single element.
- Lists containing multiple elements: The function will correctly return a tuple containing all the elements from the list.
- Lists containing different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats): The function will correctly return a tuple with the same data types.

Overall, the code seems to handle every potential case correctly, and there are no apparent examples where the program does not work as expected according to the description. Therefore, the code is considered correct.
