Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion of a list to a tuple as described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function takes an input parameter `input_list`, which is expected to be a list.
2. Inside the function, the `tuple()` function is used to convert the `input_list` into a tuple.
3. The resulting tuple is then returned by the function.

This implementation meets the requirements outlined in the problem description:

- It takes a list as input.
- It returns a tuple.
- The tuple contains all elements from the input list, as the `tuple()` function creates a tuple from all elements in the input iterable (in this case, `input_list`).

For any potential input list, this function will correctly convert it into a tuple and return it. There are no cases where it does not follow the problem description, as it directly addresses the requirement of converting a list into a tuple. 

Example use case:
```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3, "a", "b"]
result_tuple = func_1(input_list)
print(result_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b')
```
