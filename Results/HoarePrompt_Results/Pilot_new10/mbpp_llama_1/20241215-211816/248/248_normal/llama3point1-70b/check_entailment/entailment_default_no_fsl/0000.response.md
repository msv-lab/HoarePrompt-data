Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to convert a list into a tuple. It takes an input list, and using the built-in `tuple()` function, it converts the list into a tuple. This operation is straightforward and works for all potential cases, including empty lists and lists containing various data types (such as integers, floats, strings, etc.).

The provided code is concise and directly addresses the problem description. The `tuple()` function in Python is specifically designed to convert iterable objects (like lists) into tuples, which are immutable collections of objects. Since the code correctly utilizes this function, it achieves the desired conversion without any issues.

For example, calling `func_1([1, 2, 3])` would return `(1, 2, 3)`, and calling `func_1(["a", "b", "c"])` would return `('a', 'b', 'c')`. Even calling `func_1([])` correctly returns `()`, which is an empty tuple, demonstrating its ability to handle edge cases like empty lists.

Given the simplicity and directness of the solution, and considering that it handles the conversion correctly across different types of input lists, the code is correct and fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description.
