The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth. After executing the function body, the function returns `flat_list`, which is the flattened version of `nested_list`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and returns a flattened version of this list.**
