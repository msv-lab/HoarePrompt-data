Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` has been extended by `func_1(item)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the third item of `nested_list` as its last element.***
