Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a recursive function designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It correctly handles the base cases where the input list contains either integers or nested lists.

The function `func_1` works by iterating over each item in the input list `nested_list`. If an item is a list itself, the function calls itself with this sublist as the new input, effectively flattening it and extending the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list (i.e., it's a single element like an integer), it simply appends this element to the `flat_list`.

This approach ensures that all nested lists, regardless of their depth, are properly flattened and their elements are added to the `flat_list` in the correct order.

The program's correctness can be verified by examining the provided unit tests, which cover various scenarios, including:

1.  A nested list with mixed elements (integers and lists of integers).
2.  A list of lists where each sublist may contain one or more integers.
3.  A list of lists where the sublists are ordered consecutively without any non-list elements in between.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and is designed to recursively flatten lists to any depth, it should work correctly for any potential input that matches the problem description.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided test cases, the program is correct, and it will flatten any given nested list structure as expected.
