According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 1 item, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and `flat_list` is an empty list. For the loop to be executed, the `nested_list` must have at least 1 item and `item` must be the first item in the `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`**
