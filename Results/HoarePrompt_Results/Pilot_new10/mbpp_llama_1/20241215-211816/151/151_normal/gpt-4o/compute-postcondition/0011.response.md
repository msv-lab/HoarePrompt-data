According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 3 items, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 items and the `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`. 
State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`**
