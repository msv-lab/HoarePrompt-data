To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state is: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`. The code given is `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))`.

Given that `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`, and assuming `func_1` is a function designed to flatten or process the `item` (which could be an integer or a list itself), the `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(item)`. 

However, without knowing the exact nature or implementation of `func_1`, we can only assume its general purpose is to either flatten the `item` if it's a list or to process it in some way if it's an integer. 

Thus, the impact on `flat_list` is that it will contain additional elements, which are the result of applying `func_1` to `item`. The nature of these elements (whether they are integers, other lists, etc.) depends on what `func_1` does.

Considering the initial state and the effect of the code:
- `nested_list` remains unchanged because the operation is on `flat_list` and involves extending it based on `item`, which is derived from `nested_list` but does not modify it.
- `item` remains the third item in `nested_list`, as the code does not alter `nested_list` or redefine `item`.
- `flat_list` is modified by extending it with the result of `func_1(item)`, meaning its contents are increased by the output of `func_1` operating on `item`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the lack of specifics about `func_1`, is that `nested_list` still contains at least 3 items with `item` being the third one, and `flat_list` has been extended by the result of applying `func_1` to `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`, and `flat_list` has been extended by `func_1(item)`.**
