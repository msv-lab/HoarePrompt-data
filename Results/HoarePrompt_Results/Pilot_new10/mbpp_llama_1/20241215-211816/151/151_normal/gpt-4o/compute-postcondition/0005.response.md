To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we need to consider the initial state and the impact of the code on the variables involved.

Given the initial state:
- `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 1 item.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`.
- `item` is not a list.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
flat_list.append(item)
```

This code appends the value of `item` to the end of `flat_list`. Since `item` is not a list and is the first item in `nested_list`, and given that `flat_list` is initially empty, after execution:

- `nested_list` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it directly.
- `flat_list` is no longer empty; it now contains the value of `item`.
- The nature and value of `item` remain the same; it is still the first item of `nested_list` and is not a list.

Therefore, considering the initial conditions and the effect of the code:
- `nested_list` is still a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, with at least one item, and `item` is its first element which is not a list.
- `flat_list` now contains one element, which is the value of `item`.
- `item` remains the first item in `nested_list` and is not a list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists with at least one item, `flat_list` contains one element which is the value of `item`, and `item` is the first item in `nested_list` and is not a list.**
