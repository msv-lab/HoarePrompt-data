Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the `nested_list`. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` contains its original elements plus the result of `func_1(item)`. If `item` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains its previous value with `item` appended to the end.***
