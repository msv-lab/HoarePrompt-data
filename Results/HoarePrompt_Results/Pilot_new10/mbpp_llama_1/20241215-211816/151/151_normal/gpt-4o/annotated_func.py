#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and `flat_list` contains the flattened version of `nested_list`.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list, which contains the flattened version of nested_list, a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and returns a flattened version of this list. It handles lists containing non-integer and non-list elements, but may throw an error if the input is not a list.
