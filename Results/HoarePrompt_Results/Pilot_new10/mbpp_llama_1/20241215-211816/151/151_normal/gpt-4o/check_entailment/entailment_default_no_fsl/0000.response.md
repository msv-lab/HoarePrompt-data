Correctness: **True**

The given code defines a function `func_1` that is designed to flatten a nested list structure. The function recursively iterates over each item in the input list. If an item is itself a list, the function calls itself with this sublist, effectively flattening it and adding its elements to the `flat_list`. If an item is not a list, it is simply appended to the `flat_list`.

The code handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and correctly flattens them. It also handles cases where the input list contains both integers and other lists, or where the lists are nested to varying depths.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's ability to handle a variety of cases, including deeply nested lists and lists containing a mix of integers and sublists. The function's recursive nature ensures that it can handle lists of any depth, and the `isinstance` check ensures that it correctly distinguishes between list and non-list elements.

One potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that the function might throw an error if the input is not a list. However, this behavior is not necessarily incorrect, as the problem description does not specify how the function should behave in such cases. If the requirement were that the function should gracefully handle non-list inputs, then additional error checking would be needed. But based on the information given and the definition of the problem, the code is correct for every potential case that the problem description covers.
