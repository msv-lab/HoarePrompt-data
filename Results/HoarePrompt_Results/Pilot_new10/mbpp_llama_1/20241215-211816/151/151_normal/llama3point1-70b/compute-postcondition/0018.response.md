To analyze the functionality of the given function `func_1`, let's break down what the function does step by step.

1. **Function Accepts**: The function accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can contain integers and/or other lists.

2. **Function Operation**: It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements of `nested_list`. It then iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, the function calls itself recursively with `i` as the argument and extends `flat_list` with the returned flattened list. If `i` is not a list, it appends `i` to `flat_list`.

3. **Return Postconditions**: After iterating over all elements in `nested_list`, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains the flattened elements of the original `nested_list`.

Given this analysis, the function's purpose is to take a list that can contain integers and/or nested lists of integers and return a new list where all integers are at the top level, effectively "flattening" the input list.

**Edge Cases Considered**:
- **Empty List**: If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list, as there are no elements to flatten.
- **Single-Level List**: If `nested_list` contains only integers (no nested lists), the function returns a copy of `nested_list`, as there's nothing to flatten.
- **Nested Lists**: The function correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, recursively flattening them.
- **Non-List Elements**: If `nested_list` contains elements that are neither lists nor integers, the function will treat them as non-list elements and append them to `flat_list` as is.

**Missing Logic or Potential Issues**:
- **Type Handling**: The function does not check the type of non-list elements. If `nested_list` contains non-integer, non-list elements (e.g., strings, floats), they will be included in `flat_list` without any issues but might not be what the user expects if they're looking strictly for integers.
- **Recursion Depth**: For very deeply nested lists, the function could potentially hit Python's recursion limit, leading to a RecursionError.

Considering the actual code and potential edge cases, the functionality of the function is to flatten a list that may contain integers and/or other lists into a single-level list, handling lists of arbitrary depth and including all types of elements found in the original list, not just integers.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list that can contain integers and/or other lists, and returns a new list with all elements flattened to the top level, handling lists of arbitrary depth and including all types of elements found in the original list. **
