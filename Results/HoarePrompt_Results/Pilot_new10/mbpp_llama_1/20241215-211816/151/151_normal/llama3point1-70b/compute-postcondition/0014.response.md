Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains its original elements plus the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains its previous elements plus the value of `i` appended to it***
