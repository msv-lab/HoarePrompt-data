Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes a nested list structure as input, which can contain integers and/or other lists, and returns a new list with all elements flattened to the top level.

Here's why it works:

1. The function `func_1` is defined recursively, which allows it to handle lists of arbitrary depth.
2. In the `for` loop, the function iterates over each element `i` in the input list `nested_list`.
3. If `i` is a list itself, the function calls itself with `i` as the new input list, effectively flattening the nested list. The `extend` method is used to add the flattened elements to the `flat_list`.
4. If `i` is not a list (i.e., it's an integer or another type of element), it is simply appended to the `flat_list`.
5. After the `for` loop completes, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains all the elements from the original `nested_list` flattened to the top level.

This approach ensures that the function can handle lists of arbitrary depth and includes all types of elements found in the original list, as required by the problem description.

For example, if the input is `[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]]`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the flattened version of the input list.

Overall, the program is correct because it implements a recursive approach to flatten a nested list structure, which meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
