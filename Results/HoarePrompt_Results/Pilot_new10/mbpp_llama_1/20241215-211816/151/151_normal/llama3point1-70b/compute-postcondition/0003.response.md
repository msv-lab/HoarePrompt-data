To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given initial state and the Python code snippet provided. 

The initial state is: 
- `nested_list` is a list that must have at least one element.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- The first element `i` in `nested_list` is a list.
- `nested_list` has a list as its first element.

Given the code snippet: `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))`, we need to determine the impact of this code on the program's state.

The code calls a function `func_1(i)` with `i` as its argument, where `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is a list itself. The return value of `func_1(i)` is then used to extend `flat_list`.

Since the specifics of `func_1(i)` are not provided, we will assume it processes the list `i` in some manner and returns a list (or an iterable) as a result. 

Given this, the impact of the code on the program's state is:
- `flat_list` is no longer empty; it now contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.
- The values of `nested_list` and `i` are unchanged because the code does not modify them directly; it only uses `i` as an argument to `func_1`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, based on the initial state provided, is:
- `nested_list` is a list that must have at least one element, and its first element is a list.
- `flat_list` contains the result of `func_1(i)`, which are the elements returned by applying `func_1` to the first list element of `nested_list`.
- The first element `i` in `nested_list` is still a list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least one element where the first element is a list, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`, and `i` remains a list.**
