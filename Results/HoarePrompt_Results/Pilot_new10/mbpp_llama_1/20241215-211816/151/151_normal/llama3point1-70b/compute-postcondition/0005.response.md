The code `flat_list.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of `flat_list`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `nested_list` is a list that must have at least one element, 
- `flat_list` is an empty list, 
- `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, 
- the type of `i` is not a list.

After executing the code, `flat_list` will contain the first element of `nested_list`, which is `i`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least one element, `flat_list` is a list containing the first element of `nested_list` which is `i`, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`, and the type of `i` is not a list.**
