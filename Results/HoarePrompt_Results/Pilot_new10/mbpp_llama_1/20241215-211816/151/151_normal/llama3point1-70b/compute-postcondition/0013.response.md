To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given Python code and the initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `nested_list` is a list with at least three elements.
- `i` is the third element in `nested_list`.
- If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` will contain twice the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.
- If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` will contain two `i`s and the elements returned by `func_1(i)` if `i` was previously a list, otherwise `flat_list` will contain two `i`s.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.append(i)
```
This code appends the value of `i` to the end of `flat_list`.

Now, let's calculate the output state:

- The value of `i` is appended to `flat_list`.
- The type and value of `i` (whether it's a list or not) determine the initial elements of `flat_list`, but appending `i` to `flat_list` does not change the type or value of `i` itself.
- `nested_list` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
- Since we don't have the definition of `func_1(i)`, we can't determine the exact elements of `flat_list` if `i` is a list or was previously a list. However, we know that `i` is now appended to `flat_list`.

Thus, considering all the information:
- `nested_list` is still a list with at least three elements.
- `i` is still the third element in `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` now contains its previous elements (which depend on the type and previous value of `i` and the function `func_1(i)`) plus the current value of `i` appended to it.

Given these considerations, the output state is:
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `nested_list`, and `flat_list` contains its previous elements plus the value of `i` appended to it**.
