To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the program and the problem description step by step.

The problem description requires writing a Python function to check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.

The provided function, `func_1`, calculates the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` using the `^` operator. The bitwise XOR operation compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If the bits are the same, the corresponding result bit is set to 0. If the bits are different, the corresponding result bit is set to 1.

The function then converts the result of the XOR operation to a binary string using `bin()` and counts the number of '1' bits in this binary representation using `count('1')`. It returns `True` if the count of '1' bits is exactly 1 and `False` otherwise.

This approach aligns with the problem description because:

1. The bitwise XOR operation (`num1 ^ num2`) will result in a binary number where each '1' bit corresponds to a position where `num1` and `num2` differ.
2. By checking if the binary representation of the XOR result has exactly one '1' bit, the function effectively checks if `num1` and `num2` differ at one bit position only.

The function covers all necessary cases:
- When `num1` equals `num2`, the XOR operation results in 0, which in binary is '0', so the function returns `False` because there are no '1' bits.
- When the XOR operation results in a binary number with zero '1' bits, it means the numbers do not differ at any bit position (already covered by the equals case).
- When the XOR operation results in a binary number with more than one '1' bit, the function correctly returns `False` because the numbers differ at more than one bit position.
- When the XOR operation results in a binary number with exactly one '1' bit, the function correctly returns `True` because the numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

Therefore, the function does what the problem description asks for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
