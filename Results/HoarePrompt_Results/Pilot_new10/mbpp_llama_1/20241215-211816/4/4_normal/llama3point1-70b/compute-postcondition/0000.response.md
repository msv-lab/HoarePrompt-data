The expression `bin(num1 ^ num2)` calculates the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2`. The `count('1')` method then counts the number of '1' bits in this binary representation. The program returns `True` if this count is equal to 1 and `False` otherwise.

Output State: **The program returns True if the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one '1' bit, False otherwise**
