Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only by using bitwise operations. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. The function calculates the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` using the `^` operator. The XOR operation sets each bit to 1 if the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` are different.

2. The function then checks if the result of the XOR operation is not zero (`xor_result!= 0`). This is because if `a` and `b` are identical, their XOR result would be zero, indicating that they do not differ at any bit position.

3. Next, the function checks if the result of the XOR operation is a power of 2 (`xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`). This is because a number that is a power of 2 has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation (all other bits are 0). If the XOR result is a power of 2, it means that `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position.

The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, indicating that `a` and `b` differ at one bit position only. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness:

- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one bit position.
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because 15 (1111) and 8 (1000) differ at multiple bit positions.
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because 2 (10) and 3 (11) differ at one bit position.

After analyzing the function and the provided unit tests, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
