Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

To determine whether two numbers `a` and `b` differ at one bit position only, we can use the bitwise XOR operation (`^`). The XOR operation returns a result that has a bit set to 1 in each position where the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` are different.

The program calculates the XOR of `a` and `b` and stores the result in `xor_result`. It then checks two conditions:

1. `xor_result!= 0`: This ensures that `a` and `b` are not identical, because if they were identical, the XOR result would be 0.
2. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`: This checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2. A power of 2 in binary has exactly one bit set to 1 and all other bits set to 0. Subtracting 1 from a power of 2 flips all the bits to the right of the first 1, including the first 1. Therefore, a bitwise AND operation between a power of 2 and the number one less than it will always result in 0.

If both conditions are met, the program returns `True`, indicating that `a` and `b` differ at one bit position only. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one bit position.
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because 15 (1111) and 8 (1000) differ at more than one bit position.
- `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` because 2 (10) and 4 (100) differ at more than one bit position.
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because 2 (10) and 3 (11) differ at one bit position.
- `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` because 5 (101) and 1 (1) differ at one bit position.
- `func_1(1, 5)` returns `True` because 1 (1) and 5 (101) differ at one bit position.

The program correctly handles all cases and returns the expected result according to the problem description.
