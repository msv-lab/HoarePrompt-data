The function func_1 accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It then creates a complex number `complex_num` using these parts and returns its phase (angle) in radians, which is equivalent to the arctangent of `imag/real`.

However, upon examining the code, it's clear that it uses the `cmath.phase` function, which handles the calculation of the phase (angle) for all possible combinations of `real` and `imag`, including edge cases where `real` is 0 (which would otherwise result in a division by zero in the manual calculation of `imag/real`). The `cmath.phase` function correctly handles these cases and returns the appropriate phase value.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, creates a complex number from them, and returns its phase (angle) in radians, properly handling all possible cases, including those where `real` is 0. **
