Based on the provided problem description and the annotated program, the program is correct because it accurately calculates the angle of a complex number.

Here's why it is correct:

*   The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number.
*   The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two real numbers `real` and `imag` as input and creates a complex number using these values.
*   It then uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase (angle) of the complex number, which is equal to the arctangent of `imag/real`.
*   The `cmath.phase` function returns the angle in radians, which is a common and accepted representation of complex number angles.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

*   Complex numbers with a zero real part (i.e., `real = 0`), where the angle is either π/2 (for positive imaginary part) or -π/2 (for negative imaginary part).
*   Complex numbers with a zero imaginary part (i.e., `imag = 0`), where the angle is either 0 (for positive real part) or π (for negative real part).

However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle the case where both `real` and `imag` are zero. In this case, the angle is undefined in mathematics. But in Python, `cmath.phase(0)` returns 0, which could be considered a reasonable default value.

Overall, the program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description and correctly handles various edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
