Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number created from these two numbers. The `cmath.phase` function is used to calculate this angle.

The code seems to correctly follow the problem description for every potential case, including when `real` is 0. The `cmath.phase` function is designed to handle all possible cases, including complex numbers with zero real part.

In Python, the `cmath.phase` function returns the phase (angle) of a complex number in radians, in the range (-π, π]. This means it can correctly handle all quadrants and angles.

Additionally, the function should handle edge cases such as when both `real` and `imag` are 0 (in which case the angle is undefined, but `cmath.phase` will return 0), or when `real` is very large or very small (in which case the angle will be close to 0 or π, respectively).

Since the code correctly handles all these cases and agrees with the output hints, we can conclude that it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
