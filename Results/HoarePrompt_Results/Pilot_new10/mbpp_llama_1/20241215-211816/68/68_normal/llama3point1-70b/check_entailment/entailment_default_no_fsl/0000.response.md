Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements a function to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number. The function takes two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, creates a complex number from them using the `complex()` function, and then uses `cmath.phase()` to calculate the angle of the complex number in radians. 

This implementation handles all possible cases, including when `real` is 0, as `cmath.phase()` can correctly handle complex numbers with a real part of 0. The `cmath.phase()` function returns the angle in radians in the range [-π, π], which is a standard representation for the phase of a complex number.

Since the provided code correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases, including edge cases such as a real part of 0, it is considered correct. There are no apparent cases where the function would fail to produce the expected output based on the given problem description and the functionality of the `cmath.phase()` function.
