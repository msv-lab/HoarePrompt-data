Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. The `cmath.phase()` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the segment joining the origin to the complex number. The function takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are used to create a complex number.

The assertions provided in the code test the function with different complex numbers and verify that the returned angles are correct within a certain relative tolerance. 

The function works correctly for all potential cases. For example, it correctly handles complex numbers with zero real part (e.g., `0 + 1j`), complex numbers with zero imaginary part (e.g., `2 + 0j`), and complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts (e.g., `2 + 2j`).

In all cases, the `cmath.phase()` function returns the correct angle in radians, and the `func_1` function returns this angle without any modifications. Therefore, the program is correct, and the function works as expected according to the problem description. 

It's also worth noting that the function handles edge cases such as zero (which has an angle of 0), and negative numbers, as the `cmath.phase()` function returns the correct angles for these cases as well. 

So, after testing and analyzing the code, I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
