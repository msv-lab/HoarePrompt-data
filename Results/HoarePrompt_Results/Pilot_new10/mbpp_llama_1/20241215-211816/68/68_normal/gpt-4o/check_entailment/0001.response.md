Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns the angle of the complex number. The program uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the angle, which is a standard method for obtaining the phase angle of a complex number.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs, including complex numbers with non-zero real and imaginary parts, and complex numbers with a zero real part. The `math.isclose` function is used to account for floating-point precision errors.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, it appears that the program meets all the requirements and handles potential edge cases correctly. The `cmath.phase` function can handle complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts, as well as numbers with negative real or imaginary parts. Additionally, the function can handle inputs with very large or very small magnitudes.

Since no potential case has been found where the program does not work as expected, it can be concluded that the program is correct. The use of the `cmath.phase` function ensures that the program is likely to work correctly for all possible inputs, making it a reliable implementation of the problem description.
