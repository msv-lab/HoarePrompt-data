The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number, and the provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two real numbers `real` and `imag`, forms a complex number, and returns its phase (angle in radians) using the `cmath.phase` function.

The output hints indicate that the function should handle all cases, including the origin (0+0j), and return the angle in radians. 

The provided code seems to correctly implement this functionality. The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase (angle) of the complex number, and the code correctly handles the case where the complex number is at the origin.

The original assessment is "None", which implies that there was no initial evaluation of the code's correctness. 

However, based on the provided code and output hints, it appears that the function is correct and works as expected. The use of `cmath.phase` ensures that the function returns the correct angle for all complex numbers, including those at the origin.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
