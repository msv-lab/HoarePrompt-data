To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze its behavior in the context of the problem description, which asks for a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input and returns a new list. Here's the critical part of the function:

```python
return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
```

This line of code first concatenates `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a single list using the `+` operator. Then, it sorts this combined list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.

**Why the Program is Correct:**

1. **Concatenation**: The `+` operator correctly combines all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a single list, regardless of the types of elements they contain, as long as the elements are comparable (e.g., integers, strings).

2. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function sorts the combined list in ascending order. For integers, this means numerical order. For strings, this means lexicographical (alphabetical) order. The sorting is stable, meaning that when multiple records have the same key, their original order is preserved.

3. **General Applicability**: The function works for any lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` that contain elements of types that can be compared, including but not limited to integers and strings. This meets the problem description's requirement without imposing additional constraints.

4. **Handling Empty Lists**: The function correctly handles cases where any or all of the input lists are empty. In such cases, it simply returns a sorted list of the non-empty lists' elements, or an empty list if all input lists are empty.

5. **Error Handling**: While not explicitly stated in the problem description, it's worth noting that if the lists contain elements of different, incomparable types (e.g., both integers and strings), the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to sort them. This is because Python cannot compare different types directly in a sorting context without additional context or a custom sorting key.

Given the analysis above, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description for all potential cases where the input lists contain comparable elements.

Correctness: **True**
