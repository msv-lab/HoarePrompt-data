The original assessment is "None", which means that no initial evaluation of the program's correctness was provided.

Based on the problem description, the program is supposed to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists as input, concatenates them, and returns the sorted result.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function behaves as expected. It states that the function accepts three lists of comparable elements, concatenates them, sorts the resulting list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. This matches the problem description.

Therefore, based on the provided code and annotations, the program appears to be correct. The original assessment of "None" does not provide any information that contradicts this conclusion.

Final: **True**
