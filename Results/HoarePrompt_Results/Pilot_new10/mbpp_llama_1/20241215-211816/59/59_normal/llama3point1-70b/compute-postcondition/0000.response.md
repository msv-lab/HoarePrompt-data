To determine the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

The initial state mentions that `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings. 

The Python code snippet is `return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)`. This means the program will concatenate `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a single list and then sort this combined list in ascending order.

Given that the elements can be integers or strings, the sorting will be based on their natural ordering (for integers, this is numerical order; for strings, this is lexicographical order).

Output State: **The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from list1, list2, and list3, sorted in ascending order.**
