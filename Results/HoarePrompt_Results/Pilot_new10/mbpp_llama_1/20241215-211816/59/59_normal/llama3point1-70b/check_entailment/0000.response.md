Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` merges three lists into a single sorted list. It uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts the elements of a given iterable in a specific order - Ascending or Descending.

Here's why this function works as expected:

1.  The function takes three lists as input and concatenates them using the `+` operator.
2.  The `sorted` function is then used to sort the concatenated list in ascending order.
3.  The function returns the sorted list.

This approach works correctly for all possible cases, including:

*   Empty lists: The function can handle empty lists as input and will return an empty list if all three input lists are empty.
*   Lists with duplicate elements: The function will treat duplicate elements as separate elements and sort them accordingly.
*   Lists with negative numbers or floats: The function can handle lists containing negative numbers or floats and will sort them correctly.
*   Lists with different data types: However, if the lists contain different data types (e.g., integers and strings), the function may throw an error or produce unexpected results. But based on the problem description, it seems that the input lists are expected to contain comparable elements (e.g., numbers or strings).

Since the function works correctly for all potential cases and does not contain any syntax errors, the correctness of the function is **True**.
