Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` appears to be correct as it merges three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why:

- The function takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) as input.
- It concatenates these three lists into one using the `+` operator.
- Then, it sorts the combined list in ascending order using the built-in `sorted()` function.
- Finally, it returns the sorted list.

This approach covers all potential cases, including:
- Empty lists: If any of the input lists are empty, the function will still work correctly, as empty lists do not affect the sorting of the combined list.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The `sorted()` function will correctly handle lists with duplicate elements, as it is a stable sort and will maintain the relative order of equal elements.
- Lists with negative numbers or floating-point numbers: The function will also correctly handle lists containing negative numbers or floating-point numbers, as the `sorted()` function can handle these types of numbers.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases and edge cases, and it produces the expected output according to the problem description, it is considered correct.
