The original assessment is None, indicating that no initial evaluation was made. However, based on the problem description and the provided code, we can assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists as input, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and sorts the resulting list in ascending order using the `sorted` function.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, sorting the concatenated list in ascending order and raising a `TypeError` if the input lists contain non-comparable elements.

Considering the problem description and the code, it appears that the function is correctly implemented. The use of the `sorted` function ensures that the resulting list is sorted in ascending order, and the concatenation of the input lists using the `+` operator is a straightforward and efficient way to merge them.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
