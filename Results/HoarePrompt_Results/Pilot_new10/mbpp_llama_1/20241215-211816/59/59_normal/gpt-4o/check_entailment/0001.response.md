Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list using the `+` operator, and then sorts the combined list using the built-in `sorted` function.

The program handles various test cases correctly, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with different lengths. The `sorted` function is a stable sort, meaning that it maintains the relative order of equal elements, which is important in this case since the problem description does not specify how to handle duplicate elements.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the following cases:

- Lists with positive and negative numbers
- Lists with duplicate elements
- Lists with different lengths
- Lists with zero or empty lists as input

The program's simplicity and the use of built-in Python functions make it robust and efficient. The `sorted` function has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the total number of elements in the three input lists, which is suitable for most use cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
