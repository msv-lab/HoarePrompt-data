Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It first combines the input lists into one list using the `+` operator and then sorts the combined list using the built-in `sorted` function. The function returns the sorted list, which contains all elements from the input lists in ascending order.

The function assumes that the elements in the input lists can be compared with each other, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. The function also ignores empty input lists, as the `+` operator will simply omit them from the combined list.

The provided output hints and examples demonstrate the function's correctness. The function handles various input lists with different lengths and element values, and it correctly returns the sorted combined list in each case.

The function's correctness is further supported by the fact that it uses the built-in `sorted` function, which is a stable and efficient sorting algorithm in Python. This ensures that the function will produce the correct sorted output for any input lists, as long as the elements can be compared with each other.

Overall, based on the provided problem description, output hints, and examples, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements. It handles various input cases and produces the expected sorted output, making it a correct solution to the problem.
