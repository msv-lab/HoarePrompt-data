Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function takes three lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` as input.
2. It combines these lists into a single list `combined_list` using the `+` operator.
3. It sorts the `combined_list` in ascending order using the built-in `sorted()` function.
4. It returns the sorted list.

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Lists of different lengths
* Lists containing duplicate elements
* Lists containing elements of different data types (as long as they can be compared for sorting)

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness by checking its output for various input scenarios.

In summary, the program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality, merging three lists into a single sorted list, as specified in the problem description.
