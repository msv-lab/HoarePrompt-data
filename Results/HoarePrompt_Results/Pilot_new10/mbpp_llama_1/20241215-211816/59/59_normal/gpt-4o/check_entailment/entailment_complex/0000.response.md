The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to merge three lists into a single sorted list. To determine its correctness, we need to compare its functionality against the specified problem description.

The problem description asks for a function that merges three lists into one sorted list. The function provided, `func_1`, does exactly this. Here's a breakdown of how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Merging Lists**: The function starts by combining the three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into one list named `combined_list`. This is achieved through the line `combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3`, which concatenates the elements of all three lists into a single list.

2. **Sorting the Combined List**: After merging the lists, the function sorts the `combined_list` in ascending order using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This step is directly addressing the problem's requirement for the output list to be sorted.

3. **Returning the Sorted List**: Finally, the function returns the sorted list. This return value meets the problem description's requirement for the function to output a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists.

The provided unit tests (assert statements) further validate the function's correctness by checking its output against expected results for different input scenarios. These tests cover various cases, including lists with duplicate elements and lists of differing lengths, and they all indicate that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

However, it's worth noting that the problem description does not specify how the function should handle cases where the elements are not comparable (e.g., mixing strings and integers) or where the inputs are not lists. The function, as it stands, will throw an error if it encounters such cases because it relies on the `sorted()` function, which requires all elements to be comparable, and it assumes that the inputs are indeed lists. Despite this, the function is correct within the scope of the provided problem description, assuming that all elements can be compared and that inputs are always lists.

**Correctness: True**

The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list, as specified by the problem description, under the assumption that all elements are comparable and inputs are lists.
