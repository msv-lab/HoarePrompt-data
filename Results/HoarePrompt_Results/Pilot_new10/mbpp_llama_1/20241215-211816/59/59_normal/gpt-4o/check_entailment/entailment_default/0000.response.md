Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` merges three input lists into a single sorted list. The code first combines the input lists using the `+` operator and stores the result in `combined_list`. Then, it sorts `combined_list` in ascending order using the built-in `sorted()` function and returns the sorted list.

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function correctly handles the merging and sorting of the input lists. The function also correctly ignores empty input lists, as demonstrated by the examples provided.

The examples provided in the problem description demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with different lengths. Additionally, the function correctly handles cases where the input lists contain a mix of small and large numbers.

There are no apparent cases where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly assumes that the elements in the input lists can be compared with each other, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem statement. 

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and examples, it appears that the function correctly implements the specified behavior and works as expected for all potential cases.
