Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it removes all lowercase characters, not just lowercase substrings. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings, which means removing contiguous sequences of lowercase characters as a whole, not individual lowercase characters.

For example, given the string "PYthON", the program should return "PYON" (removing the substring "th"), but the provided program will return "PYN" (removing all individual lowercase characters).

To meet the problem description, the function should iterate over the string and identify sequences of lowercase characters, then remove those sequences. The current implementation does not achieve this, as it simply filters out individual lowercase characters. 

Here is a simple example to demonstrate the difference:

Input: "AbcdEFgh"
Expected Output: "EF"
Actual Output: "AEF" 

The program fails to meet the problem description because it does not treat sequences of lowercase characters as a whole substring to be removed, but rather considers each character individually.
