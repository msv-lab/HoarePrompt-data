Correctness: **False**.

The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as it removes all lowercase characters from the string instead of removing lowercase substrings. It treats each character individually, checking if it's uppercase or not, and only keeps the uppercase characters. This approach does not consider sequences of lowercase characters as substrings to be removed but rather filters out individual lowercase characters.

For example, if the input string is "aBa", the function would return "B", which is correct. However, the issue here is with the interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings." In the context of strings and substring manipulation, one might expect the function to remove sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters. However, based on the unit tests provided, it seems the intention might indeed be to simply filter out all lowercase characters, not to remove substrings in the way that term might be understood in a more general context.

Given the unit tests and the simplistic nature of the function, it seems the function is intended to filter out all lowercase characters, not specifically to identify and remove lowercase substrings (which could be a more complex operation involving pattern recognition or at least a different approach to string manipulation). 

A true test of this function's correctness according to a stricter interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings" would involve inputs where the sequence of characters matters, such as "aBa" or similar. However, the provided unit tests suggest a simpler interpretation where any character that is lowercase should be removed, regardless of its position or the positions of other characters.

Therefore, if considering the task as removing any sequence of lowercase characters as substrings, the function does not correctly fulfill this task because it doesn't handle sequences; it treats each character individually. But based on the unit tests provided, which only check the filtering of individual lowercase characters, the function behaves as expected. If the intention was indeed to remove all lowercase characters, the function is correct according to the given assertions but incorrect if a more complex interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings" is considered.
