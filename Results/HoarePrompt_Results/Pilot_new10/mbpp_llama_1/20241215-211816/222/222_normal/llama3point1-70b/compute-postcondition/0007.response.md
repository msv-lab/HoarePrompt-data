Postcondition: ***`s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string `s`. If `char` is an uppercase letter, then `result` is a string that equals the first character of `s` (if it is uppercase) plus the second character of `s`, or just the second character of `s` if the first character is not uppercase. If `char` is not an uppercase letter, then `result` remains a string that is equal to the first character of the original string `s` if the first character is an uppercase letter, otherwise `result` remains an empty string.***
