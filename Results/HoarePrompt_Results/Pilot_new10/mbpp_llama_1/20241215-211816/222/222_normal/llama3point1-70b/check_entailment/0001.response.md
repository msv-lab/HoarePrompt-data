Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1(s)` is removing all lowercase characters from the string, not substrings. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The program should identify and remove sequences of lowercase characters, not individual characters.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program should return "HW" because "ello" and "orld" are lowercase substrings. However, the given program will return "HW" which is correct in this case, but it will not work correctly for all cases, like if the input string is "aAa" the program will return "A" which is correct but if the string is "aaAaa" the program will return "A" which is also correct. But the problem with the program is it is not handling the case correctly where the string contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and the task is to remove the lowercase substrings.

However a case that will not work as expected is when a string has both upper and lowercase characters like "AAaaBB", the function will return "AABB", in this case it's working as expected but it's removing individual characters not substrings. 

But the best example to show the program is not working is when the task is to remove the lowercase substrings from a given string like "AaaBbbC" in this case the program will return "ABC" which is correct but the program does not meet the requirements of the task because it removes individual characters, not substrings.

The correct way to solve this problem is to iterate through the string and check for sequences of lowercase characters, then remove those sequences. 

Here is a simple example of how it can be done:

```python
def remove_lowercase_substrings(s):
    result = ''
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i].islower():
            # find the end of the lowercase substring
            j = i + 1
            while j < len(s) and s[j].islower():
                j += 1
            # skip the lowercase substring
            i = j
        else:
            result += s[i]
            i += 1
    return result
```
