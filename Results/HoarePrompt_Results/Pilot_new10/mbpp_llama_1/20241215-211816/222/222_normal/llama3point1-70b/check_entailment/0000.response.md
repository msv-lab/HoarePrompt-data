Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1(s)` removes all lowercase characters from a given string `s`, leaving only the uppercase characters. However, according to the problem description, the task is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. 

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of this function is the string "AbcDE". The function `func_1(s)` will return "ADE", which is correct in removing the lowercase characters, but it does not specifically target substrings that are entirely lowercase. 

A more accurate interpretation of the task would involve identifying sequences of characters that are all lowercase and removing those sequences, rather than simply filtering out individual lowercase characters.

For instance, if the input string is "AbcDEfghIJ", the correct output according to the problem description should ideally be "ADEIJ" because "bc" and "fgh" are the substrings that are entirely lowercase and should be removed. However, the provided function will only remove individual lowercase characters, not sequences identified as substrings. 

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the described task for all potential cases, particularly those involving the distinction between individual characters and substrings.
