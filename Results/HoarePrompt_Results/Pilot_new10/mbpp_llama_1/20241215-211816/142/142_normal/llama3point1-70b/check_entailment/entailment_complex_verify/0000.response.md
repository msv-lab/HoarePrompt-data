Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(lst, element)` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. The use of the built-in Python function `all()` ensures that the function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable (the generator expression comparing each item to the element) are `True`, and `False` otherwise.

The annotated version of the code confirms this, stating that the function returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element`, or if `lst` is empty, and `False` otherwise. This matches the expected behavior of the function based on the problem description.

The original assessment also considers various edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with a single element, a list with multiple elements all equal to the given element, and a list with multiple elements some of which are not equal to the given element. The assessment concludes that the function behaves as expected in all these cases.

Therefore, I agree with the original assessment that the function is correct.

Final: **True**
