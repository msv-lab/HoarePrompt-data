Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and an `element` as input and returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element` or if `lst` is empty, and `False` otherwise. This functionality aligns perfectly with the problem description.

The function utilizes the `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if every item in the list is equal to the given element. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`. If the iterable is empty, `all()` returns `True`, which correctly handles the case of an empty list.

The output hints suggest that the function should return `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element` or if `lst` is empty, which is exactly what the provided code does. It does not miss any edge cases, including the empty list scenario, because the `all()` function's behavior with an empty iterable is to return `True`.

Given this analysis, the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for all potential cases, including empty lists and lists with varying numbers of elements, some or all of which may match the given element.
