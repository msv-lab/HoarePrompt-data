Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code uses the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding item in the list is equal to the element, and `False` otherwise.

The code correctly handles the case where the list is empty, as the `all` function returns `True` for an empty iterable.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the element or if the list is empty, and `False` otherwise.

There are no edge cases that the code does not handle correctly. For example:

- If the list contains only one item and it is equal to the element, the function returns `True`.
- If the list contains multiple items and all of them are equal to the element, the function returns `True`.
- If the list contains at least one item that is not equal to the element, the function returns `False`.
- If the list is empty, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
