The original assessment and the annotated version of the code both suggest that the function `func_1` correctly checks if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The function utilizes the built-in `all` function with a generator expression to compare each item in the list to the element. This approach ensures that the function returns `True` only if all items in the list are equal to the given element or if the list is empty, and `False` otherwise.

The reasoning behind the original assessment is sound, as it accurately describes how the `all` function and the generator expression work together to achieve the desired outcome. The annotated version of the code provides additional confirmation of the function's behavior, outlining the state of the program before the function call and the return conditions.

Given that the function handles various test cases correctly, including an empty list, a list with all items equal to the given element, and a list with not all items equal to the given element, and considering the assumption that the input will always be valid, the original assessment appears to be accurate.

The annotated version does not introduce any information that would contradict the original assessment. Instead, it reinforces the understanding of the function's behavior, confirming that it aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
