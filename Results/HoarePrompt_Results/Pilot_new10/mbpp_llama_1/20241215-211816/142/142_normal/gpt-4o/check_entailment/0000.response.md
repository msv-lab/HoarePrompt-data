Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The function iterates over each item in the list, and as soon as it finds an item that does not match the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any non-matching elements, it returns `True`.

This implementation correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here are a few key scenarios to consider:

1. **All elements match:** If every element in the list is equal to the given element, the function correctly returns `True`, as demonstrated in the provided unit test `assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True`.
2. **Not all elements match:** If any element in the list does not match the given element, the function correctly returns `False`, as shown in the unit tests `assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False` and `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False`.
3. **Empty list:** The function will also implicitly handle the case of an empty list, returning `True` because there are no elements to check against the given element. This behavior is consistent with the problem description.
4. **Null or None inputs:** While not explicitly tested, the function would likely throw an exception if `lst` is `None` or if `element` is `None` (depending on the type of `element` and how it's compared), which might be considered outside the scope of the problem description. However, this does not affect the correctness of the function for the cases specified.

Given these considerations, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the described behavior for all potential cases, and no counterexamples were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
