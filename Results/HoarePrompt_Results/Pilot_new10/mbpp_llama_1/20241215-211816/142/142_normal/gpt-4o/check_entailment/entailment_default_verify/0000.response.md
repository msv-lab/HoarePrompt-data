The original assessment is correct, and the output hints provided align with the expected behavior of the function as described in the problem. The key points to consider are:

1. The function correctly returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, as evidenced by the unit test `assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True`.
2. The function correctly returns `False` if not all items in the list are equal to the given element, as demonstrated by the unit tests `assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False` and `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False`.
3. The output hints indicate that the function should return `True` if the list is empty, which aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description and the provided code.

The provided function `func_1` accurately implements the described behavior, correctly handling the specified cases. The output hints confirm this assessment, as they do not introduce any contradiction or suggest scenarios where the function might not behave according to the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains unchanged.

Final: **True**
