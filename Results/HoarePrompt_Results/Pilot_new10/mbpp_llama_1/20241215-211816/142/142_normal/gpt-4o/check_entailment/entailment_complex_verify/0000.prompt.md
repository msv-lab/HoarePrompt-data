You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The function iterates over each item in the list, and as soon as it finds an item that does not match the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any non-matching elements, it returns `True`.

This implementation correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here are a few key scenarios to consider:

1. **All elements match:** If every element in the list is equal to the given element, the function correctly returns `True`, as demonstrated in the provided unit test `assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True`.
2. **Not all elements match:** If any element in the list does not match the given element, the function correctly returns `False`, as shown in the unit tests `assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False` and `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False`.
3. **Empty list:** The function will also implicitly handle the case of an empty list, returning `True` because there are no elements to check against the given element. This behavior is consistent with the problem description.
4. **Null or None inputs:** While not explicitly tested, the function would likely throw an exception if `lst` is `None` or if `element` is `None` (depending on the type of `element` and how it's compared), which might be considered outside the scope of the problem description. However, this does not affect the correctness of the function for the cases specified.

Given these considerations, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the described behavior for all potential cases, and no counterexamples were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared to the elements in the list.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list where either all items are equal to `element`, or the function has returned `False` due to an item not equal to `element`; if `lst` is empty, the function does not execute and implicitly moves on or returns an implicit value like `None`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all items in the list `lst` are equal to `element`, since the function has not returned False due to an item not equal to `element`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element` or if `lst` is empty, and returns `False` otherwise.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
