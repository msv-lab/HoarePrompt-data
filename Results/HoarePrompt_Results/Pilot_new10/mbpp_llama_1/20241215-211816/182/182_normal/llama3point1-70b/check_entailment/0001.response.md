Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Empty strings: The function will return an empty string for an empty string, which is the expected behavior.
* Single-character strings: The function will return the single character, which is the expected behavior.
* Multi-character strings: The function will return the last character of each string, which is the expected behavior.
* Tuples containing multiple strings: The function will return a list of the last characters of each string, which is the expected behavior.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles all types of input strings and returns the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
