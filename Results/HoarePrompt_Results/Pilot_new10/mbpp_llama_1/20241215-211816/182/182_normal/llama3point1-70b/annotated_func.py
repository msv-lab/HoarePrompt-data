#State of the program right berfore the function call: strings is a tuple of strings.
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
    #The program returns a list of last characters of all the strings in the tuple 'strings'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of sequences, returns a list of the last elements of each sequence in the tuple, handling empty sequences by adding an empty string (or the last element if the sequence is not a string) to the list, and returns an empty list if the input tuple is empty.
