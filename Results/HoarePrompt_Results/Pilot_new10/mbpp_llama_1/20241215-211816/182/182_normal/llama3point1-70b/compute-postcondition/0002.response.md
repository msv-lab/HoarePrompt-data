The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of strings as input. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character of each string using `s[-1]`. 

However, potential edge cases to consider include:
- An empty tuple: In this case, the function will return an empty list because there are no strings to extract characters from.
- A tuple containing empty strings: In this case, attempting to access the last character of an empty string will result in an empty string being added to the list, because `s[-1]` on an empty string does not raise an error but instead returns an empty string.
- A tuple containing non-string elements: The function does not check the type of elements in the tuple. If the tuple contains non-string elements, attempting to access the last character using `s[-1]` will still work for sequences like lists or tuples but may fail or behave unexpectedly for other types.

Considering these cases, the functionality of the function is to accept a tuple of strings (or other sequences), and return a list of the last elements of each sequence in the tuple. If a sequence is empty, an empty string (or the last element if the sequence is not a string) is added to the list. If the tuple is empty, an empty list is returned.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of sequences, returns a list of the last elements of each sequence in the tuple, handling empty sequences by adding an empty string (or the last element if the sequence is not a string) to the list, and returns an empty list if the input tuple is empty. **
