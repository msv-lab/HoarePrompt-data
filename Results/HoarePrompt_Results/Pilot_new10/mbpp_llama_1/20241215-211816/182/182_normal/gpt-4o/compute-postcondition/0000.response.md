To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is: `tup` is a tuple containing strings.

The code snippet is: `return [s[-1] for s in tup]`

This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup`. For each string, it extracts the last character using `s[-1]` and adds it to a new list.

Since `tup` is a tuple containing strings, and the code extracts the last character of each string, the resulting list will contain the last characters of all the strings in `tup`.

Output State: **The program returns a list containing the last characters of all the strings in the tuple `tup`.**
