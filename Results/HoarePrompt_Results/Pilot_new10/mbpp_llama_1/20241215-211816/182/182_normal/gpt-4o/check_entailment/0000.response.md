Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last element of the corresponding string in the input tuple. The function uses a list comprehension to achieve this.

Here's why I believe the code is correct:

* The function iterates over each string `s` in the input tuple `tup`.
* For each string `s`, it extracts the last character using `s[-1]`, which is a valid and efficient way to access the last element of a string in Python.
* The extracted characters are collected in a list using the list comprehension syntax, which is a concise and expressive way to create lists in Python.
* The function does not perform any error checking or handling, which might be a concern if the input tuple can contain non-string elements or empty strings. However, based on the provided problem description and examples, it appears that the input is expected to be a tuple of non-empty strings. If this assumption holds, the function should work correctly.

I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I consider the program to be correct.
