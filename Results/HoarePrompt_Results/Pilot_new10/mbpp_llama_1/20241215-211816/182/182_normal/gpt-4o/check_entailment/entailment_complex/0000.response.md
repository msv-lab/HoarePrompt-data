The program provided does indeed meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, with one minor exception that doesn't affect its correctness regarding the extraction of rear index elements. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last characters of each string in the tuple. This directly aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in a given tuple.

2. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` effectively iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and extracts the last character (`s[-1]`) of each string. If any string in the tuple is empty, attempting to access `s[-1]` would raise an `IndexError`, which is in line with the overall description of what the function does.

3. **Handling Empty Tuple**: If the tuple is empty, the list comprehension will simply return an empty list because there are no elements to iterate over, which again aligns with the specified behavior.

However, it's worth noting that the assertion `assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']` suggests an expectation that doesn't match the function's actual behavior, as the function should return `['a', 't', 'o']` but the test case seems to imply an incorrect expected output. This discrepancy doesn't change the fact that the function as described does what the problem statement asks for, assuming the function's intention is correctly represented by its other assertions.

The minor exception or consideration is the handling of empty strings within the tuple. The documentation states that the function raises an `IndexError` if any string in the tuple is empty, which aligns with Python's behavior when trying to access an index of an empty sequence. This aspect of the function's behavior is not explicitly tested in the provided assertions but is an important consideration for its overall correctness.

Given the provided information and focusing strictly on whether the program does what the problem description asks, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
