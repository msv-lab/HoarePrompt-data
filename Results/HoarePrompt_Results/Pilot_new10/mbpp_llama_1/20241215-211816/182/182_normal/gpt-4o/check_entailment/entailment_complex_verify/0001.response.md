The original assessment states that the program is correct, and the annotated version of the code does not provide any information that contradicts this assessment. The annotated version explains the state of the program before the function call and the overall behavior of the function, which matches the original assessment.

The function `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in the tuple using the indexing syntax `s[-1]`, which is a valid approach in Python. The unit tests provided also support the conclusion that the function works as expected.

However, it is worth noting that the original assessment mentions that the function will return an empty string for an empty string input, which may or may not be the desired behavior. But since there are no unit tests provided for empty strings, and we assume that the input of the program will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
