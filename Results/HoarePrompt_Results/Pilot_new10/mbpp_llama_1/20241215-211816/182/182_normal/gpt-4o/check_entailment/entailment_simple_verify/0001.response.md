The original assessment correctly states that the program is correct. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding, as it describes the state of the program before the function call and the return value. The annotations are consistent with the problem description and the original assessment.

The original assessment also mentions that the function will return an empty string for an empty string input, which may or may not be the desired behavior. However, since the problem description does not specify what to do in this case, and the provided unit tests do not cover this scenario, it is reasonable to assume that the function behaves correctly for the given inputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
