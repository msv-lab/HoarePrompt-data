Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also suggest that the function works correctly for non-empty tuples containing non-empty strings. Additionally, the code handles the case of an empty tuple correctly, returning an empty list.

The output hints mention that the function raises an `IndexError` if any string in the tuple is empty. However, this behavior is not explicitly tested in the provided unit tests. Nevertheless, this behavior is indeed correct according to the hints, and the code would indeed raise an `IndexError` if it tried to access the last character of an empty string.

It's worth noting that the code is using a list comprehension to extract the last character of each string, which is a concise and efficient way to do so. The code does not have any obvious edge cases that are not handled correctly.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the code seems to be correct for every potential case, and the correctness is **True**.
