Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment seems accurate at first glance. The function `func_1` does extract the last character of each string in the given tuple, which aligns with the problem description. The unit tests provided also support this conclusion, showing that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

However, the output hints provide additional information about the expected behavior of the function, including its handling of empty strings and empty tuples. According to the output hints, the function should raise an `IndexError` if any string in the tuple is empty, but the provided code does not include any error handling for this case. Instead, it will simply return an empty string for an empty string input.

Given this discrepancy, the original assessment may not be entirely accurate. The function does not raise an `IndexError` for empty strings as the output hints suggest it should. However, considering the problem description and the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function does meet the primary requirement of extracting the last character of each string in the tuple.

The critical point of contention is the handling of empty strings, which is not explicitly addressed in the problem description but is mentioned in the output hints. The function behaves predictably for non-empty strings and returns an empty list for an empty tuple, aligning with the expected behavior for valid inputs.

Therefore, without explicit instructions on how to handle empty strings in the problem description, and given the assumption of valid input, the original assessment that the function is correct can still be defended. The function's behavior for empty strings (returning an empty string) might be seen as a reasonable interpretation of the problem, especially since it does not explicitly state what to do with empty strings.

However, strictly following the output hints' description, the function does not perfectly match the expected behavior, as it does not raise an `IndexError` for empty strings. 

Considering the emphasis on the problem description and the provided code's behavior for valid inputs, the final assessment leans towards the function being correct within the constraints provided, albeit with a note that its behavior for edge cases (like empty strings) might not fully align with all possible interpretations of the output hints.

Final: **True**
