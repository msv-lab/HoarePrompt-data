Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I have reviewed the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires a function to check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and checks if it exists in the set `months_with_30_days`, which contains the numbers of months that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11).

The original assessment states that the program is correct, and it provides valid reasons for this assessment. The assessment notes that the function correctly handles all 12 months of the year, returning `True` for months with 30 days and `False` for months with a different number of days.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function works as expected. The annotation states that the program returns `True` if the month is one of the months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), otherwise it returns `False`. This behavior is consistent with the problem description.

I have found no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly implements the required functionality, and the annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
