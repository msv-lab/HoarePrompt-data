Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully meet the problem description's requirements. The function only checks if the given month is April, June, September, or November, but it does not account for invalid inputs, such as months outside the range of 1 to 12 or non-integer inputs.

For example, if the input is `func_1(13)`, the function will return `False`, which technically meets the condition for that specific month, but it does not explicitly validate if the month is within the valid range. Moreover, if the input is a non-integer, such as `func_1(6.5)`, the function may raise an error or behave unexpectedly, which is not in line with the problem description.

Additionally, the problem description implies that the function should handle all potential cases, including edge cases, but the provided code does not include any input validation to ensure the month is within the valid range of 1 to 12 or that it's an integer. Therefore, the code does not work correctly for every potential case, making its correctness **False**. 

To improve the code, it should include input validation to check if the month is an integer within the range of 1 to 12 before checking if it has 30 days. This would ensure the function behaves as expected and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.
