Based on the provided information, the original assessment seems accurate. The program correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and checks if it exists in the set `months_with_30_days`, which contains the numbers of months that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11). 

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment. It states that the function returns `True` if the month is one of the months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), and `False` otherwise. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to check whether a given month number contains 30 days or not.

The assumption that the input will always be a valid month number between 1 and 12 is also reasonable, given the problem description. The unit tests provided also support this assessment, as they cover months with 30 days, months with 31 days, and February, which has 28 or 29 days.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
