Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. It defines a set `months_with_30_days` that includes the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November). The function then checks if the input `month` is in this set and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

This implementation meets the problem description because it correctly identifies the months with 30 days and returns the expected result for each month. The unit tests provided also support this, as they verify that the function returns `True` for June (month 6) and `False` for February (month 2) and December (month 12), which is consistent with the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, as it checks every month number from 1 to 12 and returns the expected result based on whether the month has 30 days or not. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
