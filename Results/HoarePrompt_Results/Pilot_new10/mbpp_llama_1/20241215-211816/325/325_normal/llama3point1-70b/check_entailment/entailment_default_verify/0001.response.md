The original assessment and the output hints both indicate that the program correctly identifies months with 30 days in the standard Gregorian calendar. The problem description asks to write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not, and the provided code does exactly that by returning `True` for months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and `False` for all other months.

The output hints summarize the code functionality accurately and do not provide any examples that contradict the original assessment. The code handles all potential cases as per the problem description, and since we assume that the input will be valid (a month number from 1 to 12), the program does not need to handle invalid inputs.

The original assessment is accurate because the code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The assessment provides a clear explanation of how the code works and why it meets the requirements.

Final: **True**
