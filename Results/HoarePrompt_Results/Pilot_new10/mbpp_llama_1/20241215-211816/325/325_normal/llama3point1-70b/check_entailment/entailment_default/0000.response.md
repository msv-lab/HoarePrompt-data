Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not by checking if the month is in the list `thirty_days_months`. The months in this list, April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), are the only months in the standard Gregorian calendar that have 30 days. 

The function handles all possible inputs from 1 to 12, which are the valid month numbers. For any input outside of the `thirty_days_months` list, the function correctly returns `False`, indicating the month has either 28/29 days (February) or 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December).

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, confirming that it identifies the months with 30 days as intended. Given that the function accurately reflects the standard Gregorian calendar's month lengths and handles all valid month inputs as specified, it meets the requirements described in the problem description.
