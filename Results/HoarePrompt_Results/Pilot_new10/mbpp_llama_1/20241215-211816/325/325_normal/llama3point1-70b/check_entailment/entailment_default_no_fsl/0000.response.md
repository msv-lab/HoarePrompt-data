Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number corresponds to a month with 30 days in the standard Gregorian calendar. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function uses a list `thirty_days_months` to store the month numbers of these months and then checks if the input month is in this list.

The output hints also confirm that the function works as expected, returning `True` for the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November) and `False` for the other months. 

Given the problem description and the provided code, it seems that the code correctly handles every potential case. It correctly identifies months with 30 days and returns `False` for months with 31 or fewer days (February has 28 or 29 days, depending on whether it's a leap year, and the other months have either 31 days or are already included in the list of months with 30 days). 

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, the code appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
