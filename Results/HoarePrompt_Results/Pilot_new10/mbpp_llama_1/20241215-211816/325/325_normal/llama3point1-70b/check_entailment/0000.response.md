Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct because it correctly identifies the months that have 30 days. The function `func_1(month)` checks if the given month number is in the list of months that have 30 days (`thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]`). This list includes the months of April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), which are the only months with 30 days in a non-leap year.

The function will return `True` for the month numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11, and `False` for the other month numbers. This is consistent with the problem description, which asks to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. 

All possible month numbers from 1 to 12 are handled correctly by this function, and there are no cases where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
