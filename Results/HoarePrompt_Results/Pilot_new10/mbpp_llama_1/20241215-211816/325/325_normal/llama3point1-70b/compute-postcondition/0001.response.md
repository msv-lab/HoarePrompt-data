To determine the output state, we need to consider the possible values of `month` and the list `thirty_days_months`. The `month` variable can be any integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive), and `thirty_days_months` is a list containing the months with 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

Given the code `return month in thirty_days_months`, the program checks if the value of `month` is present in the `thirty_days_months` list.

- If `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, then `month in thirty_days_months` will be `True` because these values are in the list.
- If `month` is any other value between 1 and 12 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), then `month in thirty_days_months` will be `False` because these values are not in the list.

Therefore, the program returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the `month` is one of the months with 30 days.

Output State: **The program returns True if the month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), and False otherwise.**
