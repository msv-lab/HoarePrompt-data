To assess the correctness of the program, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are represented as numbers from 1 to 12.

2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
```

3. **Original Assessment**: The assessment concludes that the program is correct because it accurately identifies months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) and returns `True` for these months, while returning `False` for months with 31 days and February (which has 28 or 29 days).

4. **Annotated Version**:
   - The function accepts an integer month and returns `True` if the month is April, June, September, or November, and `False` otherwise.
   - The state right before the function call assumes the input `month` is an integer such that `1 <= month <= 12`.
   - The function correctly identifies months with 30 days in the standard Gregorian calendar.

Given the information above, the original assessment seems accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The program correctly implements the logic to identify months with 30 days according to the Gregorian calendar, and the annotated version confirms this understanding by clarifying the function's behavior and input assumptions.

The reason the original assessment is accurate is that the program precisely matches the months with 30 days as per the problem description. The annotated version reinforces this by highlighting the function's intended behavior: to return `True` for months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) and `False` for all other months, which aligns with the expected outcome based on the standard Gregorian calendar.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original program, and the annotated version, the program is indeed correct in implementing the desired functionality.

Final: **True**
