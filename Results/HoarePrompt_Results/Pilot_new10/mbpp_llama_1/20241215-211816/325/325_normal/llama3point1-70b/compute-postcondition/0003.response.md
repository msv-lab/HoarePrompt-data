To determine the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's break down the provided information step by step:

1. **Parameters and Return Values**: The function `func_1` accepts one parameter, `month`, which is expected to be an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive. This range represents the 12 months of the year. The function returns a boolean value, `True` or `False`.

2. **Functionality Based on Annotations**: According to the annotations, the function returns `True` if the month has 30 days (April, June, September, November) and `False` otherwise.

3. **Actual Code Analysis**: Looking at the code, it defines a list `thirty_days_months` containing the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that correspond to April, June, September, and November, respectively. The function then checks if the input `month` is in this list and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

4. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**: 
    - The code does not explicitly handle cases where the input `month` is outside the range 1 to 12. However, based on the code's logic, if `month` is not in the list `thirty_days_months`, it will simply return `False`, which aligns with the expected behavior for months not having 30 days. 
    - There is no explicit handling for non-integer inputs or non-numeric inputs. However, since the function is defined to take an integer and the check is against a list of integers, non-integer inputs would result in a `False` return, assuming no other error handling is in place.
    - The function does not account for potential leap year rules or any calendar system variations that might affect the number of days in a month. However, based on the standard Gregorian calendar, the logic provided is correct for determining which months have 30 days.

5. **Conclusion**: The function `func_1` checks if a given month has 30 days and returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise, based on the standard Gregorian calendar's month lengths. It implicitly handles months with 31 days and February (which has 28 or 29 days) by returning `False` for these cases.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer month and returns True if the month is April, June, September, or November, and False otherwise, effectively identifying months with 30 days in the standard Gregorian calendar. **
