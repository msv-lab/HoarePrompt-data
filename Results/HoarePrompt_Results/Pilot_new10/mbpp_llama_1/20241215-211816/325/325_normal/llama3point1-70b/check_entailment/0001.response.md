Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function uses a list `thirty_days_months` to store the month numbers that have 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function then returns `True` if the given month is in this list and `False` otherwise.

This program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description. For months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), the function returns `True`. For months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and February (2), which has 28 or 29 days, the function returns `False`.

Since the program correctly handles all possible month numbers from 1 to 12, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
