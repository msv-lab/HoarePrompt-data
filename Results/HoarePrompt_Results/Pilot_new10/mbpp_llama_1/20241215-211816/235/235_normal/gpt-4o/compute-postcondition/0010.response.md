To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the provided information and the loop's behavior.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `n > 0`.
2. **Operations within the Loop**:
   - `total += n % 10`: This adds the last digit of `n` to `total`. The last digit of a number can be found by taking the remainder when the number is divided by 10 (`n % 10`).
   - `n //= 10`: This removes the last digit of `n` by performing integer division of `n` by 10.

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can infer the following patterns:

- After the first execution, `total` contains the last digit of the original `n`, and `n` is reduced to its integer part divided by 10.
- After the second execution, `total` seems to accumulate the last digits as `n` is reduced.
- The pattern suggests that `total` will accumulate all the digits of the original `n`, from the last digit to the first, as `n` is progressively reduced to 0.

Since the loop condition is `n > 0`, the loop will continue until `n` becomes 0. At each iteration, it adds the last digit of `n` to `total` and then removes this digit from `n`. This process accumulates all the digits of the original `n` in `total`.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed:

- `n` will be 0, because the loop continues until `n` is no longer greater than 0.
- `total` will be the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`.

This means that regardless of the initial value of `n`, the loop will execute until `n` is reduced to 0, accumulating the sum of its digits in `total`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `total` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`**
