To solve this, let's analyze the given Initial State and the code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is the original `n` without the last digit and must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to 2 times the last digit of the original `n`.

Given this, we can express `n` as `n = original_n // 10` and `total = 2 * (original_n % 10)`, where `//` denotes integer division (which removes the last digit) and `%` denotes the modulus operation (which gives the last digit).

The code snippet is:
```python
total += n % 10
```

Since `n` is `original_n` without the last digit, `n % 10` gives the last digit of `n`, which is the same as the last digit of `original_n` without considering the very last digit of `original_n`. However, this description is slightly misleading because after removing the last digit of `original_n` to get `n`, `n % 10` actually refers to the new "last digit" of the modified number `n`, not `original_n`.

But, since `n` is defined as `original_n` without its last digit, and given that `total` initially equals 2 times the last digit of `original_n`, when we do `total += n % 10`, we are essentially adding the last digit of `n` (which is the digit right before the last digit of `original_n`) to `total`.

Let's correct the understanding:
- The last digit of `original_n` is what was used to calculate `total` initially.
- `n % 10` refers to the last digit of `n`, which is the same as the second-to-last digit of `original_n`.

So, `total` after the operation becomes `2 * (last digit of original_n) + (second-to-last digit of original_n)`.

Output State: **`n` is the original `n` without the last digit and is greater than 0, `total` is equal to 2 times the last digit of the original `n` plus the last digit of `n` (which is the second-to-last digit of the original `n`)**.
