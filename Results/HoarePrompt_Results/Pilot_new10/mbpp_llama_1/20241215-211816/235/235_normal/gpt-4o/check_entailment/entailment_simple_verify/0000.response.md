The original assessment is "None", meaning there is no initial assessment to evaluate. However, based on the problem description and the provided code, we can assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior of the function. Specifically, it states that after the loop has been executed, `n` is 0 and `total` is the sum of all the digits of the original value of `n`.

The function uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `n` using the modulo operator (`n % 10`), add it to the `total`, and then remove the last digit from `n` using integer division (`n //= 10`). This process continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point `total` contains the sum of all the digits.

Based on the provided unit tests (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`), the function appears to be working correctly. For example, the sum of the digits of 345 is indeed 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, and the function returns the correct result.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe the program is correct.

Final: **True**
