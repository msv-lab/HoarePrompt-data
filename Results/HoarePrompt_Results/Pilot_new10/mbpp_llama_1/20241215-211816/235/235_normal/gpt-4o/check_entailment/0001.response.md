Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

* The function `func_1` initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits.
* The function uses a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. This ensures that all digits of the input number are processed.
* Inside the loop, the program calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 (`n % 10`), which gives the last digit of the number. This digit is added to `total`.
* After adding the last digit to `total`, the program performs integer division of `n` by 10 (`n //= 10`), effectively removing the last digit from the number.
* This process repeats until `n` becomes 0, at which point all digits have been processed, and `total` contains the sum of all digits.
* The function then returns `total`, which is the sum of the digits of the input number.

All the provided assertions (`assert func_1(345) == 12`, `assert func_1(12) == 3`, `assert func_1(97) == 16`) are also correct based on the calculation.

Since the code correctly handles the sum of digits for non-negative integers and there are no obvious edge cases that it doesn't handle, the program is considered correct.
