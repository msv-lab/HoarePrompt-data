The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the sum of its digits. The code uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the number `n` from right to left, adding the current digit to the `total` sum. Once all digits have been processed (i.e., `n` becomes 0), the function returns the `total` sum.

However, upon closer examination, it's clear that the annotations are incorrect in stating that the function returns 0. The actual code calculates the sum of the digits of the input number `n` and returns this sum.

Therefore, considering all potential cases, including edge cases where `n` is 0 (in which case the function returns 0) or where `n` has multiple digits, the functionality of the function is to calculate and return the sum of the digits of the input number `n`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. **
