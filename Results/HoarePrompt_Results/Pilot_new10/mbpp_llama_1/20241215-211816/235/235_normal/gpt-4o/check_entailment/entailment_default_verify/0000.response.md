The original assessment is None, which means it does not provide any information about the program's correctness. 

Let's evaluate the program based on the problem description and the output hints. The problem description asks for a function that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

The output hints state that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. This is consistent with the problem description.

The provided code uses a while loop to iterate over each digit of the input integer `n`. In each iteration, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`) to the total sum and then removes the last digit from `n` (using `n //= 10`). This process continues until `n` becomes 0.

The code handles the case when `n` is 0 correctly, as the while loop will not execute and the function will return 0.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the program seems to be correct. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer and handles the edge case when the input is 0.

Final: **True**
