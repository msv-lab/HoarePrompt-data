Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that: it takes a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string to be able to iterate over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up using the built-in `sum` function.

The function does what the problem description says for every potential case of a non-negative integer. For example, if `n = 123`, the function will correctly return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. If `n = 0`, it will return `0`, which is also correct because the sum of no digits (or the digit 0 in this context) is indeed 0.

The problem description does not specify what should happen if the input is not a non-negative integer, and the annotated part of the program mentions this limitation, indicating potential issues with error checking for negative integers, non-integers, or non-numeric inputs. However, the problem description strictly asks for the sum of digits of a non-negative integer, and the program correctly handles all cases within this defined input domain. Therefore, based on the given problem description, the program is correct.
