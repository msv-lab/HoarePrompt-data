#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of `n`, which is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, calculates the sum of its digits, and returns this sum as a non-negative integer. However, it does not include error checking for negative integers, non-integers, or non-numeric inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if such inputs are provided.
