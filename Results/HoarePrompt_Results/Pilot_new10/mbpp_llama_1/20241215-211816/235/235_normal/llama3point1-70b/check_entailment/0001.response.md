Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it meets the requirements stated in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.

Here's why the code is correct:

- The function converts the integer into a string using `str(n)`. This allows it to iterate over each character (digit) in the string.
- It then uses a generator expression `(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` to convert each character (digit) back into an integer and generate a sequence of these integers.
- Finally, it uses the built-in `sum` function to add up all the integers in the sequence, effectively calculating the sum of the digits.

The code handles non-negative integers as required, including single-digit numbers (e.g., `func_1(5)` returns `5`), multi-digit numbers (e.g., `func_1(123)` returns `1+2+3 = 6`), and zero (e.g., `func_1(0)` correctly returns `0` because the sum of no digits is zero).

Since all potential cases of non-negative integers are handled correctly by the function, and it accurately calculates the sum of the digits for any given non-negative integer, the program is considered correct.
