The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1` is correct and meets the requirements described in the problem. The function successfully finds the last position of an element in a sorted array by iterating through the array in reverse order and returning the index of the target element as soon as it is encountered.

The output hints provided also align with the original assessment, explaining that the function accepts a sorted list and an element, then returns the index of the element if found while iterating from the end towards the beginning, or -1 if not found.

Upon reviewing the problem description, the code, and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment is accurate. The function is designed to find the last occurrence of an element in a sorted array, and the provided implementation achieves this by searching from the end of the array towards the beginning.

One potential concern could be the assumption that the input array is sorted, as the function does not explicitly check for this condition. However, the problem statement specifies that the input array is sorted, and the output hints also assume valid input. Therefore, under the given assumptions, the function works correctly.

The unit tests (`assert` statements) provided further support the correctness of the function by demonstrating successful execution for various scenarios.

Based on this analysis, there is no indication that the original assessment is not accurate. The function's implementation aligns with the problem description and the output hints, and the provided unit tests pass successfully.

Final: **True**
