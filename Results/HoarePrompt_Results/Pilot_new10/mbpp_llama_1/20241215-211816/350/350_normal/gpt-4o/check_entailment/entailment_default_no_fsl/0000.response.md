Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it iterates through the sorted array from the end towards the beginning and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element `x` it encounters, which is the last position of `x` in the array. If `x` is not found, it returns -1, indicating that `x` was not found in the array or the array is empty. 

This approach satisfies the problem description for every potential case:

1. If `x` appears multiple times in the array, the code will return the index of the last occurrence of `x`.
2. If `x` appears only once in the array, the code will return the index of that single occurrence.
3. If `x` does not appear in the array, the code will return -1, correctly indicating that `x` was not found.
4. If the array is empty, the code will also return -1, because it does not find any occurrence of `x`.

The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the function for various scenarios. Therefore, the code meets the problem description and is correct for every potential case.
