Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. **Sorted Array**: The problem description states that the function should find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The provided unit tests and the state of the program before the function call confirm that the array is sorted.

2. **Last Position of an Element**: To find the last position of an element in a sorted array, the function iterates over the array in reverse order. It checks each element to see if it matches the target element `x`. If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index of that element.

3. **Handling Duplicate Elements**: The function correctly handles duplicate elements in the sorted array. By iterating over the array in reverse order, it ensures that the last occurrence of the target element `x` is found and returned.

4. **Handling Missing Elements**: If the target element `x` is not found in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`. This is handled by the `return -1` statement after the loop completes without finding a match.

5. **Empty Array Handling**: The function implicitly handles the case where the array is empty. In this scenario, the loop does not execute (since `len(arr)` would be `0`), and the function returns `-1`, indicating that the element was not found.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It efficiently finds the last position of an element in a sorted array, handles duplicate elements, and provides a clear indication when the element is not found or the array is empty.
