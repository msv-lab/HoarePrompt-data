Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function takes a sorted array `arr` and an element `x` as input and returns the last position of `x` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1.

Here's why the function meets the problem description:

1. **Correct iteration order**: The function iterates through the array from the end towards the beginning using a for loop with `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`. This ensures that the last occurrence of the element `x` is found first.

2. **Correct return value**: When the function finds the element `x`, it returns its index immediately, effectively giving the last position of `x` in the array.

3. **Handling of empty array**: Although not explicitly tested, the function handles the case of an empty array correctly. When `arr` is empty, `len(arr)` is 0, and the `range` function will not execute the loop, causing the function to return -1.

4. **Correct handling of element not found**: If the element `x` is not found in the array, the loop completes without finding it, and the function returns -1 as intended.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios, including when the element is present in the array and when it's not.

Overall, the function correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description and handles all potential cases.
