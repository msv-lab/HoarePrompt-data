The value of `i` is the last index of `arr`, and since `arr` is a sorted list with at least 1 element, `i` will be a non-negative integer. Given that the last element of `arr` is `x`, it implies that `x` is present in `arr` and is the last element.

Output State: **The program returns the last index of the sorted list `arr`, which corresponds to the index of the element `x` that is equal to the last element of `arr`.**
