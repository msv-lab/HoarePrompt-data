Correctness: **True**

The provided code is a Python function `func_1` that finds the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. The function iterates through the array from the end towards the beginning and returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` it encounters, which is the last position of `x` in the array.

The code correctly handles the following cases:

- When the element `x` is present in the array, the function returns its last position.
- When the element `x` is not present in the array, the function returns -1.
- When the array is empty, the function returns -1.

The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of its functionality. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function.

In general, the function works as expected and should handle all potential cases correctly. The reverse iteration through the array ensures that the last position of the element `x` is found, even if there are multiple occurrences of `x` in the array. Therefore, the correctness of the function is verified, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
