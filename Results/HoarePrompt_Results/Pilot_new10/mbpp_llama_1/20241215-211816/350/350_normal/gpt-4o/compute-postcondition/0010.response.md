To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider what happens when the loop completes its execution. The loop iterates over the array `arr` in reverse order, checking each element to see if it matches `x`. If a match is found, the function returns the index `i` of that element. 

The key observations from the provided output states after the loop executes a few times are:
- The loop requires `arr` to have at least as many elements as the number of times it executes for the given output states.
- The variable `i` takes on the value of the current index being examined, which starts at the last index of `arr` and moves backwards to the first index of `arr`.
- If the element at the current index `i` is equal to `x`, the program returns the index `i`, which means the loop terminates early.

Considering the loop code and these observations, after all iterations have finished (if the loop doesn't return early), `i` would have taken on the value of the first index of `arr` (which is 0) during the last iteration, because the loop iterates from the last index down to the first index (index 0).

However, there are two critical scenarios to consider:
1. **The loop completes without finding `x` in `arr`**: In this case, the function does not return any index (since there's no return statement outside the if condition), and `i` would have been set to -1 after the loop finishes (because the loop iterates from `len(arr) - 1` down to `-1`), indicating that `x` was not found in `arr`.
2. **The loop finds `x` in `arr` and returns its index**: In this scenario, the loop terminates early, and `i` (or more precisely, the returned value) holds the index of `x` in `arr`. 

Given the loop's logic and the initial state, if the loop executes at all, it's because `arr` is not empty. However, the final state of `i` can be deduced based on the loop's termination condition, which is either finding `x` in `arr` and returning its index or completing the loop without finding `x`, in which case the loop's natural completion doesn't explicitly set `i` to a specific value after the loop (in Python, `i` would retain its last value, which would be `-1` after the loop completes).

Considering the format and the requirements, the focus should be on the possible final states of the variables involved. Since the loop either finds `x` and returns (terminating early) or completes without finding `x`, we need to encapsulate these possibilities in the output state.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements, `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. If `x` is found in `arr`, the function returns its index; otherwise, the loop completes with `i` being `-1`, indicating `x` was not found. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute.**
