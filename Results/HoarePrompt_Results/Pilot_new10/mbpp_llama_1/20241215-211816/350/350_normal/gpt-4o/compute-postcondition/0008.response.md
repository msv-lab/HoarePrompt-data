To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. The initial state provides the following information:
- `arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements.
- `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`.
- `i` is the third last index of `arr`.

Given the code `return i`, we're returning the value of `i`, which is the third last index of `arr`. 

Since `arr` has at least 2 elements, and considering list indices in Python start at 0, the third last index (`i`) would be 2 less than the last index. If `arr` has exactly 2 elements, the last index is 1 (since indexing starts at 0), making the third last index not applicable in the traditional sense, but based on the given condition, `i` would still be a valid index in this context, referring to the first element (at index 0) when considering the "third last" in a list of two elements as a special case for explanation purposes. However, the precise definition of "third last" implies there should be at least three elements for `i` to be unambiguously the third last index.

For a list with `n` elements, the last index is `n-1`. Thus, the third last index `i` can be represented as `n-3`. 

The code simply returns `i`, which is the index of the third last element in `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the index of the third last element in the sorted list `arr`.**
