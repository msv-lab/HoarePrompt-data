According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `arr`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index of `arr`, the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`, and `arr` is a sorted list of elements that must not be empty. For the loop to execute again, `i` must decrease by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is the second last index of `arr`, and since `arr` is a sorted list that must not be empty, it must have at least 1 element. However, since `i` is now the second last index, `arr` must have at least 2 elements for `i` to be a valid index.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, `i` is the second last index of `arr`**
