To verify the correctness of the given Python function based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the function and the problem description step by step.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.

The provided function `func_1` iterates over the array in reverse order. When it encounters the target element, it immediately returns the index of that element. If the loop completes without finding the target element, the function returns -1.

Here's why this function meets the problem description:

1. **Sorted Array**: The function operates under the assumption that the input array is sorted. This is crucial because the algorithm works by starting from the end of the array and moving backwards. In a sorted array, if an element appears multiple times, all its occurrences will be adjacent or, at the very least, any occurrence of an element will be either after all previous occurrences of the same element or before all subsequent occurrences, ensuring that the first one encountered from the end is the last one.

2. **Finding the Last Position**: By iterating from the end of the array towards the beginning, the function ensures that the first occurrence of the target element it encounters is the last one in the array, meeting the requirement to find the last position of an element.

3. **Handling the Case Where the Target is Not Found**: If the target element is not present in the array, the function correctly returns -1 after checking all elements without finding a match. This handles both the case where the target is not present and the case where the input list is empty (since the loop simply won't execute in an empty list, and the function will return -1).

4. **Correctness for All Potential Cases**:
    - **Array with repeated elements**: The function will find the last occurrence of the target element.
    - **Array with single occurrence of the target element**: It will find and return the index of that single occurrence.
    - **Array without the target element**: It will correctly return -1.
    - **Empty array**: The function will return -1 as expected, since it doesn't find the target element.

Given this analysis, the function `func_1` indeed meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array, handles the case where the target element is not found, and works with empty arrays.

Correctness: **True**
