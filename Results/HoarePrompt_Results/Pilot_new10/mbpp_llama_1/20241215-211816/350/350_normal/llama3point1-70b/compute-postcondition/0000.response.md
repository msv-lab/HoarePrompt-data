According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a sorted list of elements and `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr` is not empty and `i` is the last index of `arr`. 
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements that must not be empty, `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, `i` is the last index of `arr`**
