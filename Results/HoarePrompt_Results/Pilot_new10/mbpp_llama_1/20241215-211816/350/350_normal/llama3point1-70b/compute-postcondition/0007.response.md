According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `arr`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second last index of `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1. Since `arr` has at least 2 elements and `i` is the second last index, decrementing `i` by 1 will make it the third last index if `arr` has at least 3 elements, or it will be the last index if `arr` has exactly 2 elements and then after decrement it will be -1 and loop will terminate. But for loop to execute we need `i` to be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `arr` must have at least 2 elements for `i` to be a valid index after decrementing, and after the last iteration `i` was the second last index so for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be the third last index of `arr` and since the loop is going in reverse, the new `i` must be less than the old `i` but greater than or equal to 0 so `i` must be decremented to the third last index if `arr` has at least 3 elements. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, and `i` is the third last index of `arr`**
