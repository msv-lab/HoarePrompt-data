Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a sorted array `arr` and a `target` element as input and returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1. 

The function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, checking each element against the `target`. As soon as it finds a match, it returns the index of that element, which will be the last occurrence of the `target` in the array.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function correctly handles the case where the target is not present or the list is empty. 

Since the array is sorted, the function will return the last index of the target element. This is because the last occurrence of the target element will be the last index where the target element is present in the array, as all elements after it will be either greater or equal to it.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]` and the target is `4`, the function will return `6`, which is the index of the last occurrence of `4` in the array.

The function also handles edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with a single element, correctly. If the target element is not present in the array, the function will return `-1`, indicating that the target element was not found. 

Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, it appears that the function correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases.
