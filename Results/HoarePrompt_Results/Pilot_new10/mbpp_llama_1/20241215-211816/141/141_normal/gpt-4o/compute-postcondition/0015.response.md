Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer with at least one digit, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` with at least three characters, `digit` is the third character in `digit_str`. If `digit` is already in `frequency`, then `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `frequency[digit]` is set to 1.***
