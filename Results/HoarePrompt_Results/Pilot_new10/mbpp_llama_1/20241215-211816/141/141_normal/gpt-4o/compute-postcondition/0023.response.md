Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary that must have at least two key-value pairs, `digit` is the next unique digit in `digit_str`, `count` is the frequency of `digit` in `digit_str`. If the frequency of `digit` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
