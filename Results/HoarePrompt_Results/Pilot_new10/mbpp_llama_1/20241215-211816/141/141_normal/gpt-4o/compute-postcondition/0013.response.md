The code increments the value of `frequency[digit]` by 1. `digit` is the third character in `digit_str`, which is a string representation of `n`. The states of `n` and `digit_str` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer with at least one digit, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` with at least three characters, `digit` is the third character in `digit_str`, `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1**
