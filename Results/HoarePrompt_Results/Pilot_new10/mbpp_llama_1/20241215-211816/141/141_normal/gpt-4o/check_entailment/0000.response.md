Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether the frequency of each digit in the given integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function works as follows:

1. It converts the integer to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. It uses a dictionary `frequency` to store the frequency of each digit in the integer.
3. It then iterates over the `frequency` dictionary and checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. If it finds a digit with a frequency greater than the digit, it immediately returns `False`.
4. If it checks all digits and does not find any with a frequency greater than the digit, it returns `True`.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

- It correctly handles integers with single-digit frequencies that are less than or equal to the digit.
- It correctly handles integers with single-digit frequencies that are greater than the digit.
- It correctly handles integers with multiple digits and their respective frequencies.
- It correctly handles edge cases such as integers with digits '0', where the frequency can be at most 0 (i.e., the digit '0' itself).

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also pass, further confirming the correctness of the function.

In conclusion, since the function handles all potential cases correctly and passes all provided unit tests, the program is correct.
