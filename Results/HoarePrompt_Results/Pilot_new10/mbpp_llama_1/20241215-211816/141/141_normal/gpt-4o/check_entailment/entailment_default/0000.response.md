Correctness: **True**

The code appears to be correct based on the given problem description and output hints. It properly handles the frequency of each digit in the input integer by converting it to a string, then iterating over the digits to count their occurrences. Finally, it checks if the count of each digit is less than or equal to its integer value and returns True if the condition is met; otherwise, it returns False.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1(1234)` returns True because the frequency of each digit (1, 2, 3, 4) is less than or equal to its value. Similarly, `func_1(51241)` returns False because the frequency of digit '1' is 2, which is greater than its value.

However, it is worth noting that the function may not handle edge cases such as negative integers or non-integer inputs correctly, as hinted in the output hints. But based on the problem description and provided unit tests, the function seems to work as expected for non-negative integers.

To further improve the function, you could consider adding input validation to handle such edge cases. For instance, you could raise a ValueError for negative integers or non-integer inputs. 

One example of how you can do this:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```
