To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

1. The loop iterates over each character `digit` in the string `str_n`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string representation of `n` with at least 2 characters, and `digit` is the second character in `str_n`.
3. For the loop to execute again, it must not have reached the end of the string `str_n` yet.

Given that `digit` is the second character in `str_n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `digit` should become the third character in `str_n`. Since `str_n` has at least 2 characters and the loop is iterating over its characters, for the loop to continue, `str_n` must have at least 3 characters.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `str_n`**
