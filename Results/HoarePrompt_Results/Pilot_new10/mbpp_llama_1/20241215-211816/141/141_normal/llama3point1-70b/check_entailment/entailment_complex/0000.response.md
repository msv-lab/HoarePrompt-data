To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step according to the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that takes an integer and checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

2. **Program Annotation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is defined to take a non-negative integer `n`.
   - It converts the integer `n` to its string representation `str_n`.
   - It then iterates over each digit in `str_n`.
   - For each digit, it checks if the count of the digit in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of the digit. If this condition is met, it immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any digit whose count exceeds its value, it returns `True`, indicating that the condition is met for all digits.

**Analysis**:

- The function correctly converts the integer into a string to easily iterate over each digit.
- It accurately counts the occurrences of each digit in the string representation of the number using `str_n.count(digit)`.
- It compares this count with the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`) and returns `False` as soon as it finds a digit that appears more times than its value, adhering to the problem description.
- If no such digit is found after checking all digits, it returns `True`, correctly indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to its value.

**Conclusion**:

Given the step-by-step analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks every digit in the integer to ensure its frequency does not exceed its value and returns the appropriate boolean result based on this condition.

Therefore, the program is correct as it meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
