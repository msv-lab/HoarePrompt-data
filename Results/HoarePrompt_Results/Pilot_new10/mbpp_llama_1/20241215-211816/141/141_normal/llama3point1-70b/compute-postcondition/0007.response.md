Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string representation of `n` with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in `str_n`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the program returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
