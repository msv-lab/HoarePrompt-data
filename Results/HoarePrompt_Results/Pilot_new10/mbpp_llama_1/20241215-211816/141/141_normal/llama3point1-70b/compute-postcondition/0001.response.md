According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `str_n`. If `str_n` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `str_n` is a string representation of `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` must be a string of digits. For the loop to execute, `str_n` must have at least 1 character (i.e., `n` must be greater than 0 or `str_n` must be '0') and `digit` is the first character in `str_n`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `str_n`**
