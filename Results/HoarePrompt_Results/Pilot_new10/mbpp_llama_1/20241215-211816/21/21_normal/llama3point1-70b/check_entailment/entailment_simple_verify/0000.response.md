The original assessment is "None", meaning there was no previous evaluation of the program's correctness. The problem description asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. 

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min` function. 

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function is called with a non-empty list of numbers and returns the smallest number in the list. 

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct. The `min` function is a built-in Python function that returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list), which matches the problem description. The annotated code's state before the function call and its return value also align with the expected behavior.

Therefore, given that the input is guaranteed to be a non-empty list of numbers, the program will correctly find and return the smallest number in the list.

Final: **True**
