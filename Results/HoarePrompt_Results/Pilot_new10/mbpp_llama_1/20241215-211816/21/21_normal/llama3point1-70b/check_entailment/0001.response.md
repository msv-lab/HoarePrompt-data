Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly finds the smallest number in a list. The built-in `min()` function in Python returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments. 

The function works as expected for lists containing positive and negative integers, as well as lists containing duplicate values. It will also work correctly for lists containing a single element, as the smallest number in a list with one element is that element itself.

For example, if you call `func_1([5, 2, 9, 1, 7])`, the function will return `1`, which is the smallest number in the list. 

This function assumes that the input list is non-empty. If the input list is empty, the `min()` function will raise a `ValueError` because it cannot find the smallest item in an empty list. However, since the problem description does not specify how the function should handle empty lists, and the function does correctly find the smallest number in non-empty lists, we can conclude that the function is correct for the specified task. 

No edge cases were found where the code did not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.
