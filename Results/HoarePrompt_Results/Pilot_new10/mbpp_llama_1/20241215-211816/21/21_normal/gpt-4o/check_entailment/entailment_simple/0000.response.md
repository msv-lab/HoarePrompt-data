Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description because it correctly finds the smallest number in a list of integers. The `min()` function in Python returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments. 

In the given function `func_1`, it takes a list `lst` as an argument and returns the smallest integer in the list using `min(lst)`. This matches the problem description, which asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- `assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1` checks if the function correctly identifies the smallest number in a list with multiple elements.
- `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1` checks if the function works when the smallest number is the first element in the list.
- `assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45` checks if the function works when the smallest number is also the first element in a list with larger numbers.

Since the function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function, which always returns the smallest item in a list, and the unit tests cover various scenarios, the program is correct according to the problem description.
