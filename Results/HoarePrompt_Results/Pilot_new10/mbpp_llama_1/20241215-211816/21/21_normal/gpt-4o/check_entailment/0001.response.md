Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This approach is straightforward and correct. The function does not contain any loops or conditional statements that could potentially lead to incorrect results, making it reliable for this specific task.

The function is also concise and easy to understand, which is a plus. It takes a list `lst` as input and returns the smallest element in the list. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1`, demonstrate that the function works as expected.

Since the `min` function in Python is a built-in function designed specifically to find the smallest item in an iterable (like a list), it correctly handles various cases, including lists with duplicate elements, lists with negative numbers, and lists with a single element. 

Therefore, without being able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is correct.
