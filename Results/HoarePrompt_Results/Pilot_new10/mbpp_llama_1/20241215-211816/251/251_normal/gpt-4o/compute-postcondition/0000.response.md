To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

The initial state is that `x` and `y` are real numbers. 

The code snippet is:
```python
r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
```
This line of code calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y` and assigns it to the variable `r`.

Given that `x` and `y` are real numbers, `x ** 2` and `y ** 2` will both be non-negative (or zero) because squaring a real number always results in a non-negative value. The sum of these squares, `x ** 2 + y ** 2`, will also be non-negative. 

The `math.sqrt` function then calculates the square root of this sum. Since the square root of a non-negative number is defined in the real numbers, `r` will be a non-negative real number.

Therefore, after executing this code, `x` and `y` remain real numbers, and `r` becomes a non-negative real number equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is a real number, `y` is a real number, `r` is a non-negative real number equal to `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`**
