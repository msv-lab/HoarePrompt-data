Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It accurately converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates, and returns a tuple containing the radius `r` and the angle `theta` in polar coordinates.

The program correctly calculates the radius using the Pythagorean theorem (`r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`) and the angle using the `math.atan2` function (`theta = math.atan2(y, x)`). The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error.

The program also handles negative values of `x` and `y` correctly, as the `math.atan2` function takes into account the sign of both `x` and `y` when calculating the angle.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the program for different input values.

After analyzing the program and considering different potential cases, I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
