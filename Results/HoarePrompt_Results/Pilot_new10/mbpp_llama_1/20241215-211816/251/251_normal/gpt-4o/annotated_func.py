#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, theta
    #The program returns `r`, the non-negative distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` in the Cartesian plane, and `theta`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`, where `r = math.sqrt(x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, calculates the non-negative distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`, and returns these values; however, it may produce incorrect results for invalid input values such as `NaN` or infinity, and it assumes that the input values are real numbers without performing any error checking.
