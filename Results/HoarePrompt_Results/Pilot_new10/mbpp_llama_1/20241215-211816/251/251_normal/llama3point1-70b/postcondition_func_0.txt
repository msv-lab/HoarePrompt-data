The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, calculates and returns the polar coordinates (`r`, `phi`) of the point (`x`, `y`), where `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin and `phi` is the angle from the positive x-axis in radians, handling edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN.
