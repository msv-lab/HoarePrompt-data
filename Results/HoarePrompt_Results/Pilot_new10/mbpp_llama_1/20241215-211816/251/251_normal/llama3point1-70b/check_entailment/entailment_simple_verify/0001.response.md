The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial assessment was provided. Based on the problem description, which asks for a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, and the provided code, the function `func_1` appears to be correctly implementing this conversion.

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program before the function call and the calculations performed within the function. It correctly states that `r` is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y` (which is the definition of the radial coordinate in polar coordinates) and `phi` is the arctangent of `y` divided by `x` (which is the definition of the angular coordinate in polar coordinates), both in radians.

The use of `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate `r` and `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate `phi` is also correct, as `math.hypot` computes the Euclidean norm (which is the square root of the sum of the squares) and `math.atan2` computes the arctangent of `y/x`, taking into account the quadrant of the point `(x, y)`.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
