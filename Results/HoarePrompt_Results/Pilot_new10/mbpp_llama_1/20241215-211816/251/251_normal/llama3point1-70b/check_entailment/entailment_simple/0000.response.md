To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify that it correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates for all possible input cases.

The problem description asks for a function that takes rectangular coordinates (x, y) and returns the corresponding polar coordinates (r, phi), where r is the radius (or distance from the origin) and phi is the angle in radians.

The provided function, `func_1(x, y)`, calculates `r` using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which is equivalent to the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y` (`sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`). This correctly computes the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), which is the definition of `r` in polar coordinates.

For `phi`, the function uses `math.atan2(y, x)`, which computes the arctangent of `y/x` in radians. The `math.atan2` function is specifically designed to handle the case where `x` is zero (to avoid division by zero) and also returns an angle in the correct quadrant based on the signs of `x` and `y`. This is in line with the definition of `phi` in polar coordinates, which is the angle in the counterclockwise direction from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y).

Given these explanations, the function `func_1(x, y)` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates as described in the problem description for all real numbers `x` and `y`.

Correctness: **True**
