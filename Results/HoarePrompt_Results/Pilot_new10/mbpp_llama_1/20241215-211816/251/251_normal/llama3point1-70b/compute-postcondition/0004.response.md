The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are real numbers. According to the code, it calculates `r` as the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y` using `math.hypot(x, y)`, and `phi` as the arctangent of `y` divided by `x` in radians using `math.atan2(y, x)`. The code does what the annotations say. 

However, the code does not handle potential edge cases such as when `x` and `y` are both zero, in which case `phi` is undefined in mathematics but `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns 0 in Python, or when `x` or `y` is infinity or NaN (Not a Number), which may cause `math.hypot` or `math.atan2` to return infinity or NaN.

Considering the code and the return postconditions, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to calculate and return the polar coordinates (`r`, `phi`) of a point given its Cartesian coordinates (`x`, `y`), handling potential edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, calculates and returns the polar coordinates (`r`, `phi`) of the point (`x`, `y`), where `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin and `phi` is the angle from the positive x-axis in radians, handling edge cases where `x` or `y` may be zero, infinity, or NaN. **
