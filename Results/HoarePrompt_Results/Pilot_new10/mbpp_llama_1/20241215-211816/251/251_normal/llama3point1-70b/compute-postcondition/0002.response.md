The program returns `r` and `phi`, where `r` is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `phi` is equal to the arctangent of `y` divided by `x` in radians. The value of `r` is the distance from the origin to the point (`x`, `y`) in a 2D plane, and `phi` is the angle from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the point (`x`, `y`) in a counterclockwise direction.

Output State: **The program returns `r`, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`, and `phi`, which is the arctangent of `y` divided by `x` in radians.**
