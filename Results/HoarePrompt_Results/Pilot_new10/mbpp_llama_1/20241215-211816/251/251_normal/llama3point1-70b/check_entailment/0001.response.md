Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a function that converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1(x, y)` takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It then calculates the corresponding polar coordinates, `r` (radial distance) and `phi` (azimuthal angle), using the following formulas:

- `r = math.hypot(x, y)`: This calculates the distance of the point from the origin using the Euclidean norm.
- `phi = math.atan2(y, x)`: This calculates the angle of the point from the positive x-axis in the counterclockwise direction.

The use of `math.atan2(y, x)` instead of `math.atan(y/x)` is crucial here because it correctly handles the cases where `x` is zero (which would result in a division by zero error if `math.atan(y/x)` were used) and also handles the quadrant of the point correctly.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:
- When the point is at the origin (0, 0), where `r` is correctly calculated as 0, and `phi` can be any value but `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns 0.
- When the point is on the positive x-axis, where `phi` is correctly calculated as 0.
- When the point is on the positive y-axis, where `phi` is correctly calculated as π/2.
- When the point is in any of the four quadrants, where `phi` is correctly calculated to be in the range [-π, π].
- When the point has negative coordinates, where the calculations for `r` and `phi` are still correct.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program seems to correctly convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates for all possible inputs. Therefore, without any found edge cases that the code does not handle according to the description, the program is considered correct.
