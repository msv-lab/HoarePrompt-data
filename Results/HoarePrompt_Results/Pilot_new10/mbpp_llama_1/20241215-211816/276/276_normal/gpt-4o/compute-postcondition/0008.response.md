The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, and `n` is a positive integer. The constraints on these parameters are such that `len(list1) == n` and `len(list2) == n`, and both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order. The function returns the median of the sorted merged list, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the merged list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers, list1 and list2, and a positive integer n, where n is the length of both lists, and returns the median of the sorted merged list of list1 and list2.**
