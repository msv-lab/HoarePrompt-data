Given that `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of numbers with length `n`, and `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`, the `median` calculation is based on the middle values of `merged_list`. Since the length of `merged_list` is `2n`, which is even, the `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. 

The program returns `median`, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted `merged_list`. These middle numbers are `merged_list[n - 1]` and `merged_list[n]`, where `n` equals `mid` and is a positive integer representing half the length of `merged_list`.

Output State: **The program returns the median, which is the average of the two middle numbers in the sorted merged_list, calculated as (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2, where merged_list is a sorted list of length 2n containing all elements from the sorted lists list1 and list2.**
