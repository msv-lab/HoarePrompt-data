Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. **Merging the Lists**: The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` and merges them into a single list `merged_list`. This is done using the `+` operator to concatenate the lists and then sorting the resulting list using the `sorted` function.

2. **Finding the Median**: The function calculates the median based on whether the length of the `merged_list` is even or odd. However, given that the problem description specifies the lists are of the same size, and thus the merged list will always have an even number of elements (since `len(list1) == n` and `len(list2) == n`, making the total length `2n`), the condition for an odd length is not applicable.

3. **Handling Even Length**: For an even-length `merged_list`, the function correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. This is done by finding the middle index `mid` and then calculating the median as `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`. This formula is correct because `mid - 1` refers to the first middle number, and `mid` refers to the second middle number in the sorted merged list.

4. **Consistency with Problem Description**: The problem description asks for the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function provides this by merging and sorting the lists, and then calculating the median based on the assumption of an even-length merged list, which is consistent with the problem description's implication that the total length of the merged list is `2n`.

In every potential case where two sorted lists of the same size are input, the function correctly calculates and returns the median as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program's behavior aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem description.
