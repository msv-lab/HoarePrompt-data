Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Merging the lists**: The program merges the two input lists (`list1` and `list2`) into a single list (`merged_list`) and sorts it. This is a necessary step to find the median of the combined data.

2. **Calculating the median**: After merging and sorting the lists, the program calculates the median based on whether the length of the `merged_list` is even or odd. 

   - If the length of `merged_list` is even (which it always should be, given that both input lists are of the same size `n` and their elements are merged), the median is correctly calculated as the average of the two middle numbers (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`) where `mid = len(merged_list) // 2`. This condition should always be met given the problem constraints, making the odd case unnecessary in practice but it is correctly handled for theoretical completeness.

   - The handling for an odd-length `merged_list` is theoretically correct but practically irrelevant under the problem's constraints. Since both input lists are of the same size `n`, the merged list will always have an even length (`2n`), meaning the median will always be the average of two middle numbers.

3. **Return value**: The function returns the calculated median, which is the correct result according to the problem description.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test the function with different sets of input lists, and the expected results match the problem description, further confirming the correctness of the function.

In summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size by merging the lists, sorting the merged list, and then calculating the median based on the length of the merged list. It handles both the even and odd cases theoretically but, given the constraints, it will always deal with an even-length merged list in practice.
